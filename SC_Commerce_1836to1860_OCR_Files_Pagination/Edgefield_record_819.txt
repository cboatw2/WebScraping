This morning, for the first time, Mrs.
Madison availed herself of the privilege
of the floor. She with two other ladies
was conducted to a seat close to the Speak
er's chair. This will be an excellent ar
rangement for the Speaker, as he can now
amuso himself by whispering sentiment to
the ladies. 1 am afraid other ladies will
be jealous and want also tobe admitted.

- In the Senate, this morning, Mr. Bates
called attention to the fact that when he
presented the Massachusetts resolutions the

up by a continued discussion otn. the re'port
of the Election Committee, in favor of the
non-districted members. Mecssrs, Beards

The Paris fortifications were about to t

All the chambers of the Court of Chas- c
sation assembled on the 12th, with closed
doors, to inquire into the conduct of M. a
Defontaine, a judge of Lille, who was ac- d
cused of having compromised tire dignity g
of his judicial character, and having vie- fi
lated his oath, by repairing to London to a
pay homage to the Duke of Bordeaux.- n
The Gazette de France says, that M. De- h
fontaine had been reprimanded by the ti
Court, but the Journal des Debate states, tl
that the judgment would only be delivered it
on Saturday.
The Paris Joturnal des Debats has an o
article on "Americani Repudiation." It a
mentions Mississippi, Michigan and Flor
ida, as the only States that have sanctioned t
repudiation, owing together 654,000,000. t
The only cause which prevents payment ol
by all the States is said to be a repugnance a
to direct taxation. Thte following para- al
graphs fi-om the article are worthy of at- s5
tentimon :s

Dear Sir.-Believing it a duty highly

a your valuable paper. The mankner or

About the 15th of January, sev~eral of
ny negroes were taken with a violent sore
broat, pain in the head and fever, swelling
f the glands of the neck and behind the ear.
then did not know what the disease eras;
nd from its progress of termination, it
aused mte to be much alarmed; on the first
lay it was a simple sore throut; in tw elve
tours after the sore throat commenced
here was a pain in the head, and before
wenty four hours, hot fever and swelling
>f the glands and neck almost to sutfoca

ore, and in two or three days effecting a

ure was affected. Strong red peper ten
was given in the interval,(at night and
ometimes throughout the day) from a tea i
up full to a pint, according to nge; this 1
was given for the sore. throat. I did not

:omplained of the sore throat I gave them
t full dose of Jalap; and had no further I
rouble with it, as the disease was stopped
here, and never went no further; the next
lay gave a small dose to prevent the re I
n, of which I was afraid. From this i
imple treatment the disease yielded so
-eadily, that I considered it a trifling com

lrs. Chaplin, if any of the other children
vere attacked with it, to pursue the same
reatment. In my absence, my two young

oms were not violent. Out of thirty-four I

Directions.-immediately on the first

rained from going into the full particulars,
fearing lest an untimely publication might
lefeat the end of justice, and we are de
tired to say that the various publications
n some of the papers were entirely tnau
horized by him. An examination was
(esterday held, at which the following
acts were elicited Michael McAuley and
Patrick Laughlin. two boatmen, who have
teen arrested, stated that on Saturday
tight week they were engaged by a Mr.
Sutton who owns some small boats, to go
along side of the packet ship Oxford, and
>ring ashore some small bales of goods,
vhich would be delivered to them. Mc
4uley went on board in the day time, and
lad an interview with Mr. Jacob Gates,
he mate of the vessel, telling him, that as

frought one boat load, which he landed at
he lower side of Peck ship, where they
were received by Sutton and Latghlin,
and conveyed it a carriage, to a Sailor
oarding house, No. 76, James street, kept
,y Benj. F. Parker, Day Police Officer of
he 4th Ward. Ou Sunday night another
oad was also landed. but on this occasion
he carriage which conveyed theta was
watched by two Custom House Officers
tad the whole affair was discovered.
A part of the goods landed were found
it Parker's in the cellar, and part on the
inth Avenue. at a place called the Carss
Keys. Twenty-three bales of the same
ot, intended to be smuggled, were found
;n board the Oxforl, and information was
;ained which led to the seizure of six more
tales on board the M.mtezuma, which
ressel arrived on Monday.
A warrant was issuced for the arrest of
11r. Gates. but he managed to keep out of
he way, until yesterday afternoon, just as
he examination of McAuley and Laugh
in was closed, when he was brought in.
q1r. Curtis, the Collector, consulted with
tim a few minutes in private, when he
stated he was perfectly willing to be ex
imined, and Mr. Curtis said he was fully
authorized to state that Gates confessed
tis guilt. His examination will be held
o day, and, in the mean time, there is no
oubt but that the prime mover and owner
'f the goods will be in custody, and on

The Plague.-We made ana extract
rom a Massachusetts pap~er, stating that
a Saxotnville six p'rsotns had died of atn
aktown't disease, int pieking some wool
which came t'romn Smyrna. The doctors
onsidered the dlisease as a mnere inflam
matory lever, caused by the dus~t from the
rool. We should be apprehensive that
twas thte plague broughat from Turkey itn
be wool. If so,it should all be destroyed,
ad the greatest precatttion used in having
itercourse with personts laboring under
te disease. Plaguae is contaginous, taot an
pidemic; consequcently, it pervails in all
easons of' the year. More or less it is
Iways to be found in the East, as the
Ittsselmen use no precaution. A very
hotra quarantine is imptsed on all vessels
rom Turkish or Egyptian ports arriving
in Italy, France or Spain, The 'grer~i
lague in Marseilles, 200 years ago, wich
early devastated that city, was introduced
romn Turkey, as also the terrile~ plogne in
aondon, in the 16th century. In '1814 it
irevailed to a great extent at Malta, intro
ueed in leather from Alexsundria. it has
eon introduced into pl'ces- by a pigeon
ying on shore from t'ae quarantine ves
els, with some diseased wvool in its beak.
t may be a mere fever that prevails at
he factory, but physicians should be
harply on the look out.-Sun.

Tl&' Tcmprance Cause in Sarannah
-'he, Editor tcturned. from Si vannah
yesterday morning, just before our paper
went to press. On Wqlnesday eventag,
Mr. I-lawtius, the Ten mperunoc faecturer.
delivered an address in the Mithodist
Church to a full house, and the resultwa.s
that about 120 individuals signed the total
abstinence pledge, among whom was a
number who have long indulged to
;reat excessin the use of alcoholic drinks.
This was his second address; the fist in
the Presbyterian Church, iroughton-st.,
was delivered on Monday nigitto a crow
ded house, and was spoken of by many:
frieuds of the cause with great satisfaction. {

of the State of. Georgia.- payable is$a
vanoah, and raised to $20, was passed ot'
a gentleman in this place, by. a -stranger,

The figures, xx's, and the word; 'twenty
dollars," judging from appearances, were
cut from a blank bill of what is usuallj
denominated "Florida money," and were
very ingeniously plastered on such portions
of the bill as was requisite to make ft ap-'
pear like a genuine $20 note by a-tliir
glutinous substance. Should any such be' :
in circulation, they can easily be detected
by holding them up to. the light, face out

Petitions from the South.-As Massa
chusetts, in contenmpt of the comiomise'
of the Constitution, has proposed that the
South be deprived of its slave representa
tion in Congress, it would be well for: the.
South to counteract this movement,.bf'
insisting on the representation in Cohgreas
of its entire slave population. .Let: peti
tions be extensively circulated and- signed
in the Southern States, calling on Con
gress so to amend' the Constitution arm
permit the whole of their. population to
the benefits of representation, and not
three-fifths of a minority of that popula
tion.
On their own principles the Abolition-.
ists in the Legislature of :Massachusetts
ad elsewhere cannot deny the justicea fn
propriety of this proposal, They refuse
o view slaves as property. They-consider .
hem endowed with the qualities thatenti
le them to tife privileges of other classes
ifsociety. This is the abstract th'eory of
ight. The conclusion frdom this doctijie
s inevitable. If slaves are persons, in au.
hat constitutes personality, they should be
epresented, not by a moiety but :entirel .
We would, therefore suggest that tlio-Sath
neet the movement of Massachusetts, by
~xtenuively petitigning Congress~ fdirsuch'
in alteration- of the Constitution ag-will
nittle it to the benefits of a full i-opreen-,
aliitn of numbers of Congress, io-wimt the
