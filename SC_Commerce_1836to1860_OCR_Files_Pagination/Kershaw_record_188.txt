From France.?The packet ship liurgundy,
Capt. Roekett, from Havre, has
arrived. She brings lis dates to the loth
February. Generally speaking, the political
news they contain has already reached
us by the last Liverpool packet, but
we is it el in the papers now received, a circumstance
to which we bad not before
adverted. The French Government has
withdrawn by a royal ordinance, the cxc~
tjuatur granted to Mr. Gravini, United t
.States Consul at Algiers, and by another
decree bus appointed M. Eonnevialle,
President of t!io Chamber of Commerce
of Algiers, to perform provisionally the
duties of that oMice- M. Gravini had
hcen apjiointcd bv Abd-cl-Kadcr. the rr.
fractory Bev of Constantino, his Oukil or
representative at Algeirs, and lie had rcccntly
paid a visit to his camp. On the
return of M. Gruvini, lie caused a gun
carriage to be constructed, which he immediately
sent to the Ivnir. This net appears
to have displeased the public authorities,
who no sooner became acquainted
with it. than they caused the mechanic
who had, made the carriage to be thrown
into prison. The ollicial character of Mr
Gruvini, forbade their acting with him in
alike summary manner, but complaints of
his conduct were made by General Vallc
to Government, who thereupon withdrew
tlie exequatur which had not long before
boon granted.
South Ai.icrica.?Accounts from Buenos

December previous, the Legislature of
the province commenced their session,
and received the usual Annual Message
frotn the President. In regard to their
iclalions with the I'nited States, he says:
"The unexpected difficulties of which
the govcrhmont informed you in the last
message, having been removed, it has
named a Minister Extraordinary to the
Cabinet of Washington, who will shortly
proceed on his mission. It sincerely desires
good intelligence between that Republic
and the Confederation. And obliged
to fulfil the sacred duty of energetically
remonstrating against the violent and
atrocious conduct of the captain of the
sloop of wur Lexington, at the Falkland
Island; it hopes that the scandal of this
event will be completely redressed by I lie
government of a nation as jealous of its
honor, as distinguished by the justice and
liberality of its principles."
On the subject of the Falkland Islands,
lie further observes;
The question with Great Britain remains
in the same state as was announced
to you,in the preceding year. The jus4

imposes upon it the strict duty not to
abandon them. The negotiation, power
will continue its course opportunely, as
the government happily has not yet any
reason to suspect that in the termination
of this negotiation, power will usurp the
rights which the civilization of the age
assigns to justice."
The Argentine Republic having made
common cause with Chili in the war
against Peru, the accounts which had just
reached Buenos Ayres of the conclusion
of a treaty of peace between General!
Santa Cruz, the Protector of Peru, and
the Chilian General Blanco, who commanded
the Chilian army which invaded"Peru
had given much dissatisfaction, although
by a d cerec which is published, it appears!
that the President of Chili has refused to
ratify it. In the mean time it is stated

an occurrence had taken place
calculated still further to embarrass it.
The papers state that the British brig
Packet, bound for Cobija, was refused
clearance, on the ground, that her destination
was an enemy's port; and that notwithstanding
she actually sailed under
the protection of the commander of the
British naval forces on the station. According
to private letters, the Chilian
schooner of war Colocolo was sent in her
pursuit, whereupon the British Commodore
also got under weigh and neither of\

PHILADELPHIA, March 27.
mutiny.?We are informed by an officer
of the service, that a serious mutiny occurred
two or three days since at the Naval
Asylum on the Schuylkill, in which
the pensioners were engaged against the
officers of the establishment; who were
locked in close confinement by their assailants.
The commander of the Asylum,
we learn, was very severely injured ?
Means were at last found by the prisoners
to communicate news of their condition
to the officers at the Navy Yard,?whereupon
a lieutenant and a few troops were
despatched to the rescue. They succeeded
in quelling the mutiny; and taking the
leaders into their custody, conveyed them
to the Sea GulU lying off the Yard, where
they arc now in durance, awaiting judgment.
The Algonquin.?Wc learn from the
New York Express, that this packet was
insured last week at some of the Wall
street offices, at the rate of 7 1-2 per cent.
She had a very difficult passage hither,?
as may be gleaned from a few particulars,
with which we have been politely furnish*ed
by Mr. Cofice of the Exchange. On
the ninth of January, the packet left Liverpool.
She cx peri need heavy westwardly
gales for forty days,?in fact, had
not but twenty-four hours'favorable winds
during the passage?lost bulwarks, fifteen
slaunclicous, started head knees, cut water
and upper part ol' the stern?was compelled
to run south. The appearance and
slate of the ship, as she cauve from sea,
speak for the great perseverance of ('apt.
Turley and his officers, as well as for the
staunchness of the craft.
Her cargo is estimated lobe worto at
least three hundred thousand dollars, and
I not a package of which was lost; though
[at one time it was thought that they would
be compelled to throw overboard a part of
Iter cargo to bring the leak above water,
and to prevent her from filling. The leak
was from two to three feet under water.
Capt. Turley prepared wood in battens
and pieces of canvass, ami nailed them

tiic sea he was enabled to give two or
three blows with the hammer. No one
could remain over more than five minutes
at a time, for with every plunge she made
he would be buried in the sea. Captaii
Turley, his mate and carpenter, took theii
turn in being dropped over, and in 111iway
the ship, cargo, and their lives were

Upwards of one hundred thousand dollars
were insured in our offices, where
great apprehensions were felt for the safely
of the ship.
She is now at Walnut street wharf discharging

For the Courier.
Mr. Editor:?We observed with no small
degree of surprise in your last Courier,
that the writer who appeared as ,4Paul
Pry," had given a wrong Statement in regard
to the apostle of Ireland, whom, in
the sport of creative fancy, I presume he
has ycleped a mere Saint, a fabulous
Saint, llad he taksn the trouble of consulting
Joseph Collier's Biogriphical Dictionary,
he would have found his fable realized
in the account given of St. Patrick,
as the Apostle and Bishop of Ireland, in
431; as having founded the metropolitan
Church of Armagh, and introduced the
use of letters into Ireland. lie might

Probus and others. That ho was born j
towards the close of the 4th century, at
Iloly Tours, in ArmoricGaul, since called
Brilagnc, and that his family's decent
from the most probable account, was Roman.
It is true that Doct. Ledivicherlher
from an indolent or a malicious cause denied
his existence, but Valiancy proved
it the assumed silence of all the writers
from the 5th to the 8th century is no proof
against it, and the competition of Wales,
Scotland and England, also to officiate;
him, as seven cities once contended lor
he honor of the birth pi tee of the ccle> ^3
Lrated Homer, is a triumphant proof that
Ireland owned its great Saint, as Circccc
owned its great poet, and tliut the illustrious
Patrick by shedding the light of religion
and of letters amongst his countrymen,
is well deserving of their religious,
perpetuated honors, though it is attempted
to depict him as **a mere Saint, the

an existence, save in the bigotted minds
of our unfortunate Mid ignorant countrymen
Enough has been said to show that great

that a comparison drawn betwixt those
of the ages gone bv, and those of succeeding
ages, reflects an imperishable lustre
on the latter, as the imitators of the!

it is not too much to add, that if \vc|
wished to stimulate men to perform deeds
of moral greatness, and prompt in their
souls the noble enthusiasm of goodness,
we should look upon the venerable names
of Patrick and Washington, as one of the
most conducive means to effect this happy
result.
There can be then, no shame attached
to the writer "R." as degrading "himself,
his country, and his countrymenby
drawing a simile with Washint? n, and Si.
Patrick, whose festival is annealv celebrated
by all the sons of Erin. A id surc-ly

miserable larcc of the 17th of March.
JUSTICE.
FOR THE COURIER.
Mr. Editor.?Wore I lo address you as a stranger,
I would not bo wanting in respectful apology, when
seeking redress through your columns; but you know
liberality forbids men to tnakc such a tresspass on
your paticnco. When I drew vour attention to tlin
in -stilt offered to a largo portion of your fellow citizens
on St. Patrick's day, it was not to elicit a carsing
sneer of the bigot, or to call forth or imitate the
rebald slang of "Paul Pry." No, sir, my motives
were more elevated. I wished to tako llio proper
moans of giving expression to our feelings (I do not
share the insult alone) and to fit the mark of our
contempt and public disapprobation on the base individual,
who thus saught the mantle of night to con- i
coal his infamy and to givu udvlitioj. 'V shade to the
darkness that hangs around the soul of intoleratc
bigotry.
Then* ia a dignity in tlio gentleman that always,
bespeaks a nobleness of purpose, an 1 never descends I
to deeds that would dishonor or dagrule. This, in
my opinion, is the most faithful standard of individual
worth and respectability?and, society, founded!

givo support and encouragement to virtue and merit,
no matter of what climo or creed, and would not, if i
they could, even allow a stone flung l>v a truant hand, >
to ripple the smooth gliding current of social nffoc- ]
tion. Docs it argue a want of "cominyn senso in
no to try, and arrest tho disturber's baud, and to add
ny humble etforts in causing this peaceful current
to he perpetual in its flow ? But this picture, which
n tho ininds of the benevolent , would spread out into
landscape beauty, seems to bo too much enlarged not
:o contract a stain. Like a decayed oak, strewed
along tho plane, a stroke from somo dauber's crush
has loft behind its blemish, and gives a sad appear,
ance to the perspective var.oty of light and shad..
"Paul Pry" has fairly disclosed his purpose. II
says to me :?'cousin Pete wants to give you a rub,'
and then with his bucket in cno hand, m.l rude pencil
in the other, he rubs our pleasing picturi of fnei.d.
ly society?adding, in tho pride of one who is delighted
with his work:?"Pete is a very droll chap
andean sting pretty sovere." As his avowed object
is to "sting severe" I would merely suggest, that, at
this cool season of liberal principles, our atmosphere
is not likely to rise to fanatic waainth, and (to con- j
tinue his own classic figuro) that his waspish "sting"
might bo bettor encouraged and more actively employed,
iftransferrcd to the hive of northern bigots.

but it is not always an indication of superior sense,

Mr. Editor, in your official career you may, but
cortainly I never have witnessed such barefaced dis.
regard for history, and such unfair porvorsion of
words. As to the "scholar and tho man of learning"
1 givo him up without pretension or claim to "Paul
Pry"-?who "knows that himself, & Co. aro hard to
beat," and who looks with such disdain 011 tho "ignoranco
of our unforinnato countrymen." A plain

{learned modesty would tor Li J nic to act the pedant.
Mine bo lite humble uuassmiii g honor and not the
"shame" of linking, (not comparing) the iiuuiortaJ
names of St. Putrick and Washington.
Little did I think, that the friendly mention ol
these names, so muok the object of my reverence and
respect, could fever the mind of any, or cause him
in a raving mood to say "you have rendered yourself
unworthy tho name of an Irishman, to compare the
greatest and best man the world ever produced, with
a fabulous saint'*?his only ground for thai iiiijjutntion
is u statement in my lust communication, in which
I said:?"I cannot conceive why they should tiy to
wound tho feelings of their adopted citizens,
by thus trifling with the Washington of tlieir country."
In this, I wished to affirm, that dear as the
memory of Washintonis to America, equally dear?
yes, and more sacred is tho memory of St. Patrick to
tho Irish christian; I say more sacred, because in on
much, as the soul is superior to the body?in or much
uu me ivpo.Hiie oi subduing his onoiny by the
sword of the spirit,?is superior in his divine mission,
j to the haro who conquered by tlio "sword of the
flesh"?-so much the more sacred is the memory of
hira who lends and points out the way to tho evor1
astiug enjoyment of God, thun ihe memory of him,
who himself, relying on the merits of Christ, and
asking tho prayers of his ministry, leads freeinon to
liberty?but that liberty, like all suhluminury grandcur,
loaving only the impression of time-stamped
immortality. Were Washington to meet St. Patrick,
or uny other herald of heavenly truth, when
about to enter tho doubtful fiold of battle, would he
deem himself wanting in "common sense," or think
his name or person too "illustrious," to stoop and ask
a blessing on himself and fellow soldiers?including
those from tho ' Emerald Isle" who fought with
valor undor tho cheering smiles of his approval ??
"Paul Pry" might say to him for this condescension:
"s'namo biother \Va hingten, you have rendered
yourself unworthy the name" of an Amor cm by,
asking th.3 "creature of supers! itiou" to seek a blessou
your arms. It would not r. quire an imag n ition
