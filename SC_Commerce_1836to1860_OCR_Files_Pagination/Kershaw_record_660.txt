Congress ought not to be convened more than j
once in two years. Now, we are approaching
? the time when Congress will resolve itself into
a perpetual body, and vet accomplish 110 business,
even of the most pressing nature.
After a six month's session, we are now pretty
much where we began, except that Congress
has passed one of the appropriation bills, a treasury
note bill, and the loan bill?not one of
which measures should have occupied more than i
three days. The apportionment bill is as much
in doubt and as far from being settled as ever.'?
The revenue bill, which was the great, work to

never been taken up, or matured? Congress
has done nothing towards its completion, except
to close the door to all information on the subject.
They, then, after refusing to authorize
any committee to collect information on the
bearing of the present revenue laws, called
upon the Secretary of the Treasury for his plan
of revenne, comprehending a complete system
of revenue laws. The Secretary has sent them
a bill, but at the same time passing over two of
the worst^topics for lack of information. The
manufacturers have presented one bill in the
House, and Mr. Simmons is preparing another
in the Senate. The Committee on Finance of
the House are not yet prepared to report, and
whenever they ,do report, it will appear tha'
they are moving in the dark and without all the
lights which could easily have been afforded
them by the experieuce of practical men in this
country. But notwithstanding all these difficulties
and delays, it seems probable that about the
flOlh of June, when otir revenue will for the
most part, and in some brances entirely crasr,
Congress will begin to deem it necessary to look
a little into the subject of providing a revenue
forjhe Government. Dog day legislation js, ;;ij
best, hasty and imperfect, under any circumstances,
but, in this case, it is likely'to be particurlarly
so. Party considerations, inconncr4tion
with the subject of the land revenue, will
serve to enhance the difficult}'. Some have already
predicted, and Mr. Calhoun among others,
that tl.e Revenue Bill will fail. I hope
not, but really it seems to be more than probable.

WASHINGTON, MAY 29.
It may be interesting to know precisely how
much of the loan, authorized by the late act of
Congress,'and to obtain which such strenuous
exertions have been made, lias been taken. 1
have ascertained that as yet notoncccn' bus been
obtained?notwithstanding all the assertions and
surmises of the press on the subject, and all the
declarations in Congress. The fact is that Messrs.
Ward & Co. of New York loaned to the government
the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, not upo:i its stock, but to be reimbursed
out of the loan, w!tn,i obtained. There
arc no offers for '.lie loan, and no steps have been
taken to send an agent to Europe for it. Air.
Charles Fenton Mercer is now spoken of as a j
commissioner on the part of the government to
? ?l"? Irtui '['be President leaves tliO I
uuguiiavu inw if ?*.. - ---respops.ibiiity
oi" this matter with the Secro'ary]
of the Treasury, and has not interfered in it.? j
The failure to obtain the u?oney is as signal as
any one foresaw or predicted.
It is said that the main reason why this government
cannot get money at a high rate 01 interest
so low in London, is the uncertainty of our stayin
g any revenue after the 30th of June. It has.
been declared by o*"- most eminent men, tiiat a'
direct tax, in time ol peace, would never be re- i
sorted to; as to the land fund that is lost, and will i
not probably soon be recovered; and it is doubt-'
ed whether and bill providing lor an adequate '
and permanent revenue from the customs wiil
be soon passed. There appears to be sulficient
reasons for the hesitation of capitalists, both here
"* and abroad, without resorting to others connected
with the general shock which American credit
has received.
It is the opinion, today, that the Senate will
concur with the House in their reduction of the
Army and Navy appropriations. The necessity
of reducing expenditures is apparent, and will
be urged with great effect.
Some sensations has been produced at Philadelphia,
by the orders of the Navy Department
countermanding the launch of the Raritav, and
dismissing the hands from the Navy yard. A
breeze has, in like manner, been kicked up at
.Norfolk. Mr. Upshur, as soon as the House!
determined to reduce the appropriations, gave!
orders, accordingly, with a view to meet the'
emergency. He desoacheJ expresses to slop J

Mr. Linn moved a vote of thanks to Mr.
Southard lor the able and impartial manner in ?
which hcliad filled the Chair, accompanied with 1
aii expression of the regret of the Senate at the t
cause of his resignation.
Tlio apportionment bill was again taken up
and .Mr. Allen moved to strike out the amend- <
ment of the Judiciary Committee, which disa- <
grees to the district system, and leaves it option- ! t
al with the Stales to elect their representatives 11
as they may please, but provides that, in case j I
they e.ect by districts, these districts shall be ;
contigm us to each and that each district shall 1
eiecW>r?e member only, &.c.
.The cli'ect of the proviso of the Senate is to
require those States which have double and quad- '
ruplo districts, like New York and Pennsylvania,
to divide tlum into single districts. Thus
the city of New York forms one district aud ! 1
elects lour members. The proviso would require (<
lour single districts. Tiie New York and l'enu-11
sylvauia members were vehemently opposed to' I
the amendment, and saidj^iat it was impractica-' 1
hie and would not be obaigxyed. But if obeyed,;
tfie consequence of the law would be that these I <
States would be driven to instruct their repre- i
seatatives to go for a general ticket system.? <
The consequence of this would be that New
York and Pennsylvania, with a few additional
States, could combine to control the govern
mant.
The debate was continued till a late hour, by
Mr. Aden, Mr. Huntington, aod Mr. Wright.
The house agreed to meet, hereafter, at 10
o'clock in tiic morning?an hour earlier.

TEX THOUSAND LIVES LOST.
TREMENDOUS EARTHQUAKE IN THE ISLAND OK STDOMINGO.
By the politeness of C'apt. Morris, of the brig
\Vm. Neilson, from Port a 11 Prince, we have "Lo
Patrioto" of the 11th May, published at that
place, which gives an account of a shocking
earthquake that occurred in that island on the
7th May, at 5 o'clock in the evening.
The principal destruction of life, of which we
have an account, was at Cape Jiayticn, which
town was entirely destroyed. It contained
al.out 15,009 inhabitants, two thirds of whom are
thought to he dead.
The approach of the earthquake was indica'ed
in Port an Prince by great heat, and heavy clouds
tint orci ;;.e neignDormg mi.s, aim louo.vea
i he direction of the South-VVest to tiio A'orthIXst.
The rebels at anchor, some of the sailor.? report,
experienced the shock before they saw the ;
houses agitated, winch .seemed to indicate that
the shod: cnnic from the west.
There wore two shocks at I'ort an Prince very
distinctly felt, the tlrst not so long as the second,
which last endured about three minutes. la very j
person strove to tret out of the houses, and the
streets were tilled with the affrighted population.
A little longer, says the Patriot, and I'ort au j
Prince would have been the theatre of a disaster j
similar to that of 1770, of which disastrous year j
the remembrance was rushing into all minds. ,
The Patriot also says that there is hardly a
house or a wall that has not suffered a little.?
Some have become almost uninhabited. The,
front of the Senate House, where the arms oftiie j
Republic are sculptured, is detached and broken, i
The interior was uninjured.

On Monday morning at 12 o'clock, there was ;

changeable, now extreme hear, now rain, now i
air, and now signs of a strrm.
On Tuesday again there was another shock,?
ttid since then, says the Patriot, "it seems to us j
:hat we walk upon a quaking earth."
Saint Marc.?A letter front this town says ;
that the earthquake was felt there with violence.
Many houses were seriously damaged, and sonic
destroyed?but no loss of life is mentioned.
At tiouaivos tlie shocks were yet more seri3us.
The greater part of the houses were overthrown.
A lire broke out at the same time, and
there was not a drop of water in town. Ail the

This letter concludes at 6 a. ni., by saying
"it is only halt an hour since that we lelt a
very great con.mot,on. At present, we are ignorant
of the number of persons kiiied or wounded.
All the prisoners who are not burned in the

CaVe Haytien*.?Thetown of Cape Haytien l
has entirely disappeared, and with it two thirds!
of the population. The families that could escape
are tied to Forsotte, where they were without
an asylum, clothing or provisions.
The President of Hayti, has given orders to the
physicians and officers of the hospitals to leave
the city immediately in order to give succor to
the distressed. Other aid of all kinds was about
to be despatched by water to the distressed.
LATER.
In addition to the above disastrous intelligence
from the Cape, a courier arrived from the city a
few hours previous to the -departure of Capt
Morris, who stated that a fire broke out M'Lcrthe
earthquake, which, on Monday the 9th, destroyed
the powder magazine, and with it tiic miserable
remnant of the inhabitants who had escaped !
the earthquake. The towns of St. Nicholas and
Port Paix are also said to bo destroyed. Other
parts of the island had not been heard from when
Capt. Morris left; but it is conjectured that all
the towns of the north are amass of ruins.

such a course is promised by some influential i
men of that party, and for the sake of peace, we
are disposed to wait patiently, and see the redemption
or forfeiture oi this assurance.
Tnis is the oniy course which that party can I
pursue to restore a permanent peace within our
borders; and a neglect or refusal to do that, will
show to the world, who are the real conservatives
of law and order, and who are so only by
profession.
Money Island.?There is a romantic island
situated between Wrightsvile and Mansoriboro
sound, about eight miles from Wilmington,
which has borne the above name from time immemorial.
It derived its name from this circumstance,
we believe. It is well known or supposed,
that the celebrated Teach, or Black Beard,
as he was called, had buried large amounts of
money some where on tire coast, and. tradition,
pointed to this place. Accordingly several persons,
some, from a longdistance, visited the spot,
in the hope of finding the hidden treasure. And
even at the present time, the earth is turned and
dug up, so as to render the walking extremely
unpleasant. It is quite a bcautitul place, being
covered with large trees, and the vines entwining
themselves together, lonn as pretty an arbor
as any love-sick swain would desire in which,
to breathe the vows of constancy and love. Vv'c
behove that none of the mouey has been found,

O* We received, too late for publication in
to-day's paper, an interesting Tale, entitled
"AIarian Wentworth," written by a young lady
of Camden, which we will publish next week;
and hope the fair authoress will not permit the
first cflort to be her last.
Cotton Blooms-?We received on Saturday
last, a stalk of Cotton, with the following note,
from Col. W. J. Taylor^f this District, which
we take great pleasure, in' laying before our
readers, as well for the present as for an induce,
ment to our farmers to follow the example of
Col. Taylor, in the "liberal application of ma^r
nure," which, it will be seen, be assigns as the
principal reason for the rapid growth of his crop.
In addition the bloom mentioned, we counted on
the same stalk, twenty-nine forms If any of
our Kershaw, Sumter or Lancaster farmers can.
beat this, we shall be glad to,'hear from them.

To Ike Editor of the CamdeT&Jfolimal.
Dear Sir":" As you have through your Journal,
evinced an interest in agricultural matters, 1
take the liberty of sending you a plant of Okra.
Cotton, on which are many forms and one bloom,
which was fully expanded yesterday. There is
also, if you will observe, another bloom m forwardness,
wiiich I think, .wmild have opened in
the course of to-day, had not the plant been'interrupted.
It is* unusually early for cotton
blooms?earlier by weeks, than I have ever .
known in this section. This stalk measures two,
feet 4;} inches. . .
The growth and early bloom of this plant may
be attributable in part, to the season, but mainly
to the kind of Cotton (Okra) and the warmth
imparted to the soil by the liberal application of
manure. I have planted this year, 14 acres of
the Bunch or Rives Cotton, and up to this time,
the Okra is ahead. If the insects spare iny Cotton.
you will hear more of the Okra and Manure
this summer, as I expect, by means of the
two, to have good picking, ginning and packingearly
in August. ?
Willi respect, yours* &.c.
WILLIAM J. TAYLOR.
P. S.?Since the above was in type, we were
presented by J. J. Dunlap, Esq. of White Oak,
in this District with a bloom taken from his

will prove mortal. Waddell is from North Carolina
and Waring from South Carolina. Both
are under 20, and neither has been more than
eight months in the Navy. The quarrel, it is onlv
necessary to say, originated from a trifling
cause."
Titp Wir.vnT.ii.?The Mnr nnmher nf this m
tercsting Southern Monthly is on our table. Its
pages are enriched with a great variety of con- v
tributions, from the pens of the most gifted sons
of Georgia and Carolina. We trust that the '
efforts which are now making to place this work
on a permanent basis, will prove eminently successful?for
it merits, richly, au extensive patronage.
Wo would respectfully suggest ro the publisher,
the propriety of an exertion to get it out earlier
in the month.
Requisition of Gov. Dqor ?The Providence
Journal states that a requisition has been made
by the King-Governor of Rhode Island, on Gov.
Seward of New York, and Governor Davis of
Massachusetts, for the arrest and surrender of
Gov. Dorr, should he come into- either of their
respective States; also on Gov. Cleveland of
Connecticut, who, it is thought yvill decline a
compliance.
If the party who elected Gov. Dorr suffer him
to be imprisoned, they deserve not only to be
deprived of the right of suffrage, but of every
other right dear to freemen.
!T7*During the discussion of the bill t"> refund
the amount of the tax imposed upon Gen. Jackson
for declaring martial law at New Orleans,
Mr. Preston paid the following eloquent compliment
to the old Hero?we regret to add however,
that Mr. P. would not vote for the bill unless
it could'be so amended, as to defeat the object
of the friends of the General in introducing it:?
"Escaping for an instant from our bitter party
struggles, and going back to mingle our recollections
and sympathies upon the battle
ground of New Orleans, I would not tarnish
r - <
the moment of pure ana generuun iccm,*
any emotion or act inconsistent with them.?
I turn my memory and my heart to that
scene, and that time with an entire oblivion of
alj the circumstances that have separated me
from, and placed me in opposition to, General
Jackson since. I will not detract from the glory,
or diminish my admiration, of the illustratious
chief, by the retroative influence of subsequent
events; but, forgetting and overleaping the intervening
space, I place myself where I was twenty-five
years ago, with the glow of patriotic
gratitude and exulting admiration that thea
