v .'wii li-an order that the Committee
..might take up the amendments of the S
nabe to the Navy bill.
31ir. Pickens said that as the bill had es
tordav been laid aside on his responsibi ity,
and-as he was now prepared to go on,
maust decline to yield the floor, and be BC
cordingly proceeded in his remarks.
After some preliminary observations..he
said that the bill under consideration had
two objects; the first, to raise revenue for
the supply of. the wants of Government,
6 'NL~and the second, to afrd protection to ex
tensive interests connected with thi domes
tic manufactures of the country.
His purpose was to confine himself prin
- cipally to the first brunch ef the subject.
and, ao doing so. chiefly to consider the
views of the Chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means on the financial ques
eJon. The Chairman of that Committee
(Mr. Fillmore) had wade his estimate of
the imports or the country on the basis of
-our imp'orts in 1840. which was $197,000,
000, of which $18.000 000 were reshipped,

coiding tit-e calculation of the gentlewan,
on which imppsts were to be levied.
The great question presented was, how
enuld we roisg, as required, according to
the estimate of the Committee on Finance,
27.000,000 revenue from $77,000,000 im
parts. The gentleman had said tha.$27.
000.000 reveuue was necessary for the
wants of the Government, and he propos
ed to raise it by imposts, or in other words.
by taxation on imports. It would require
a duty of 36 per cent on this amount of
$77,000,000 to raise $27,000.000; and the
question ias, whether this amount of im
ortations would produce this revenue?
11r. P's impression was, that those who
supported tis bill under the idea that it
would give 327,000,000, would find them -
selves totally deceived. The question
which the peopleof this country would put
to themselves was, why (41 they propose
this 30 per cent or $27,000.000 on imports;
to raise this irmense amount of revenue
from onl one branch of national industry ?
.did not propose to go fully into
the question.of who .ere-4o pay this
amount of W1,000,000. lie did not ire
to endway fhat. it fell on the producers,
and yet to say that it fell'on the consumers
was a declarationas full of absurdity as
the coantary opinion, to say the least of it.

Whtwas the situationl of the coun*
~siepresent time f-The gentleman hs
pr'oposed a tax bill preciucly as if thecoudF
tr7.Was the sm as-in 1828eor 1832. Now,
9 .wtth a circulaioof $94,000,000, and 680.
000,000 of specie, they proposed tonievy a
-duty of 36 per cent on the importations of
she country.under the idea that they could
collect in she samenmanner as in 1828 and
'32, when we hda circulation orsio06,
000,000, which was- more than 50 per
6 - cent more than the specie at that time in
the coutry, and about $10,000.000 more
a than the cir-'ulation of' 1842. while the
population of the countrv was five maillions
-less than at the present tinmc. Is was a tax
hlich, under existing circumstances, the
- 6 country would never pay, because it never
T could pay it. Under existing circumstan
- tses, a20 er cent duty was egual soma40
-or even 4)per cent duty in 1828 or 1832.
x What was she-difference as regarded she
- capital and labour of this country -at this
i time and in18S32! A: that time the domes
ti prdut of this country commanded a
fair price, niasithere was but listle surplus
~-~ .labor or capital; all of it was invested.
But now there wa a suarplus capital to a
vast extent lying- absolutely idle in our
-larg cities; and so it was with regard to
surpus labor. If they expected so raise
-$27,000,00-i..36percenston 877.000.
~' 4)00-to raise it from the imnporlh of the
e,.~.~contry exclusively, they would be entire

erenteennel nder this protection, and
-he surplus labor and capital of this coun

Ai ~ bosevery articles they proposed 'to pro

gi:what was the situation of a we
ry important and growing ro~ison of this
T Confederacy-thbe interior est-as com
pared with 1828 and 1&321 A t that period
-t was com1paratively a nen' country ; the
whbole of its lanhor was devoted ;M.cuttiog
-,- down the forests, reducing their freids to
cultivation, and building their hotuses. It
was then a small consumning portion of
- this Confederacy, and had hut very little
interest in the duties imposed on foreign
~* .i~ = ,"~articles. N4o country had exhibited so re
-pid changes within the last ten or fifteen
- i,.. -~years.. it was now tho most extensive,

or todireetdy, and it skirted a thousand
miles of the finest water in the world, thus

-'with the British colonies.

Peel. So far as grain was concern

West, separated by a short distance from
the Caada frontier; and thus their impor
tations being duty free in British bottoms.o
so far- as revenue was concerned, thei
.would find themselves totally deceived as
to-the revenue to be collected. He id not
mean to say that smuggling would be car
ried on by gentlemen on this side of Usna
da. but th morality of the age had re
ceived a great blow by thefalse, unjust,.
and resitictive measures that had been
adopted; and when our taxation was rame
ed so high as to prove unreasonable, the
morality which will induce them to pay a
tax when the same articles could be got
duty free. would rarely be found. Those
gentlemen who expected protection under
tile duty of 36 per cent. would find them
selves greatly deluded.
Mr. P. did not propose to discuss the
q uestion bow we were to raise revenue.
e held the gentleman to the bill on the
table. He took the negative of the ques
tion, and left the gentleman to find out the
ways and means to support the Govern
ment; but he said, according to all the
lightsor past experience. if they expected
in this matiner to raise this amount of
$27,000,000, they would find themselves
deceived. This Government could not
last ten years and support its expenses by
taxation levied exclusively on its foreig
commerce. le defied them to collect the
revenue for the support of Government, if
they intended to collect it exclusively on
the importations of the country.
What was the situation of the world in
regard to this matter? Twenty-five years
ago it had come out of a universal war,
and then the idea of restriction and retali
ation on foreign commerce had universal
prevalence throughout all the nations of
Cristendom. But the whole face of modern
society had changed. Mr. P. adverted to
the efect of steam power connected with
commerce in brioging us in direct and al
most daily communication with all the
nations of the world. and the influence of
these mighty agents in connexion with that
great reformer of modern times-the free
press-lu connecting us in union and bar
mony with every people on the globe.
Restriction and retaliation on foreign com
merce was against the univerval spirit of
the age.
The old notion of restriction and retallia
lion arose on the assumption that it was ne
cessary to secure our national indepen
deuce, aid, ia the true spirit of Chinese
philosophy, to raise around us barriers by
which we could be protected from the
plunder of a world. Better for us at once
to lay aside all the luxuries of commerce
to strike down the arts and refinements of
life-to put out the lights of science and
learning, and sink back again into thick
barbarian darkness. Restriction or retali
ation would end in confusion and disap
pointment. What was free trade but the
very soul and life of modern eivilization?
and were they now to strike at this great
power, which was going fortb conquering
and to conquer, to redeem a world sleep
ing iaduarknews -- * - -
Dat tier isio had been full of power and
wealhb; but who wvas there tbat had seemn
the fial end of England. and could look
vithout ahudde'ring at the desolation that
most sooner or later be spread all over that
land! Mr. P. drew.a lowring picture of
the misery amid wretchedniess of the poor
peasant of Ireland, as lie returned at night
to divide among his starving family their
scanty pittance. the proceeds of his daily
labor, and of the poor factory girl of Eng
land; antI would ask of them if they felt
the blessings of JBritish wealth and protec
tion? Their cries of vengence ascended
to lieaven against this accursed system of
ineqrality and injustice; and was ihere
aught in this system of inequality to com
mend it to the admiration of freemen?
The efli-ct of this whole le-gislative re
striction would be to discoirage the impor
tations amn which duties could(1 be collectedl to
one fourth of the amount, and to transfer
the trade to she St. Lawrence in British
bottoms ; and the result of that would tie toe
strike at that great right arm of our na
tional defence, our commercial marine.
lie would not siive a fig foer our rnavy, our
ships, or our guns floatinig on the high seas,

As to the other 'eranch of the subject
the effects of our legislation on the distribu
tion of wealth and thme wages of labor.
The large class of interests which es pec
ted 'by these restrictions to have duomestic
manufactures protected. would itn like
manner be deceived. It was said that a
tariff was necessary to preserve specie in
this country. He could not understand
the nmodtus operondi ofna restriction prevent
ing the exportation of gold and silver. Mr.
P. proceeded to show that this was not the
case; but, granting that this would he the
effect, he contended that the specie itself
might be expanded as well as paper, and
prduce disastrous effects on the trade of
the cotintiry, if we. had more specie than
was necesacry to conduct our domestic ex
canges. It was to he brought buck here
and centered in the protective regions, and
become. the basis of an esounded circula
tion and expanded credit ! What would
be the effect of thIs local expanso of the
currency on the interests of domestic Is-oor
connected with manufactures in thIs coun
try? The prices In a very few years
would come up to the very level of the re
striction imposed, and then there would
be a demand for a new expansion and a
ne; protection, and the domestic prices
would be swelled up by restriction after re
striction, or if that was refused, they would
go through a series of disorder .and ruin
back again to their former standard.
IMr, P. referred to a table of the exports
aiditpors from 1829 to 1833, inclusive,
andflron 1833 to 1841, inclusive, showing
that the annual excess of the Imnportations
