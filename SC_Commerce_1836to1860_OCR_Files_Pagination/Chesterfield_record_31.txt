Ertractsfrom the Speech of Mr. lleedy (of

All parts of our wide and extended country
are striving and exerting every nerve to

make railroads and canals?avenues to the
ocean. Who at this day falls in question

y, The subject we arc now considering is an
appropriation for surveying and exploring
the Pacific Ocean and South Seas. The
form of the bill has been objected to by the
gentleman from Va. (Mr. Pay ton.) who
spoke a short time since. He objects, because,
by the provisions of the bill, the President
is authorized (if in his opinion the pub.
lie interest sha/t require) to send out a surv
yingani exploring expedition, and he is of
opinion we ought not to devolve upon the
President the duty and obligation of deciding
whether the expedition ought to be undertaken
or not.
I entirely concur*with that gentleman in his
views upon the subject. We ought to assome
the responsibility that justly lielongs to
the Representatives of the U. States, an 1 I
have no desire to avoid that responsibility.
It would, therefore, have been much more in
accordance with my opinion, had the amend,
nient provider! for a direct appropriation,
leaving no condition or discretionary power
iii that respect with the President. But it
*Kftnt there are some members of this
I louse who entertaiu a different opinion, and
tiiey insist upon the form proposed: and be.
lietiug, as I do, tho result will be the same,
1<un disposed, in the present case, to consent
to tlie amendment. By the bill itself I
Ve express our opinions most decidedly in .
favor of tlie expedition. The President may I
refuse to execute tho law but under such
circumstances I am confident bo ici/l not. J
The President is not entrusted with power i
to do more than the law provides, but may
- decline to act, and, in that event, the law
would be executed^and the expedition would
M.
If t!?e bill become a law, it will be the
imperative duty of the Executive to investigate
the subject, or consult those who have ,
investigated it, and I have no apprehension :
of the result, and do not, therefore, oppose
the amendment lest tliebill might be defeated
The gontlanan from Virginia (Mr. Pey- J
ton) suggest s|t hat there may be constitution- ;
ul objections, but declines to state them, or;
oiler uu argument upon that suojecr. r>oin''
oilier gentlemen have hinted at the same
difficulty. For myself! have no doubt of1
* * i
t!?e constitutionality of the law proposed,
and I am ready to sustain my opinions here; '
but I will not trespass upon the time of this j
House by an argument in a ease, in mv
judgment, so plain, unless it be in reply to !
real objections actually made. The Pacific j
Ocean and South Seas ate surely our own, |
us tenants iu common w ith other nations.
They are the highway of nations, and emphatically
the broad highway in which we
travel more, and have a greater intenst than
any other nation.
A large portion (considerably more than
one-half) of the ships and tonage engaged
iu the.whale fishery belongs to the distinct
which 1 have tlie honor to represent. It became
my duty as a Representative, years
ago, to investigate the proposed expedition.
My investigation resulted in the most perfect
and entire conviction of its utility and
importance, not only to those engaged in the
fishery, but to the whole country. I have
much information connected with and having
a material bearing upon the subject,
which, under other circumstances, and at an
earlier, period of the session, when we had
more leisure, T should have felt inclined to
present to the consideration of the committee.
But knowing, as I do, that the time is
short, ami that there is much that ought to
be done, I shall limit myself and confine my
remarks mainly to a general view of the
subject, referring for more minute and statistical
information to the printed reports laid
upon our tables, and which are before me.
I have to notice the subject in one or two
points of view, which, in my opinion, have
not been sufficiency noticed cither in
speeches or reports, and which I deem of
ti'ie highest irnDortancc to the true intb'rests
?
of tlie country.

I shall not attempt to present to the committee
in detail the amount and value of our
various interests in the Pacific Ocean. The
fur trade has been a source of no inconsiderable
profit. Our commerce of every
description in that ocean, already great, is
rapidly increasing, and capable of being
vastly extended. Our whale lishery, which
might seem to demand more particularly mv
regard and notice, has been extended over
a great part of that vast ocean, and is df
great amount. I refer to two short extracts
' which show the amount of capital employed
I in the whale fishery, and principally in
! those seas.
What i stho amount of our interest in the
seas where the principal labors of the expo,
tion will be performed ?
To say nothing of the vessels engaged in

The London Public Ledger says that

owes its origin, (it is said) to the unprecedented
success, Fn point of despatch
and cheapness, of the light passenger boats
on the Scocth canals, between Paisly, j
Glassgow, and Edinburgh, and the inven- j
tion of a new apparatus for passing light1
boats rapidly up and down the ascents and j
descents of canals without loss of time, or
expenditure of water.
It is now found that light Iron boats,
carrying from 100 to 150 passengers, can
be conveyed on canals by two horses, at
the rate of 10 or twelve miles per hour.
It is estimated that travellers can be carried
by canal, from one town to the other, a distance
of thirty-two miles, at from 17 to 20

I\DIA\ WAR.
CoIumJjui June 17 .
One of the most serious and deperate engageinents
that lias happened since the commencement
ofthe present war, took place about three
miles above Fort Jones, on Thursday last. About
forty of the Gwinnett cavalry, under Capt.
Garmony, were stationed at tho house of Mr. i
Shepherd, tho balance of the company having j
i?ccn detailed forsouio other service, ('apt. G.in :
the fornoon of that day, had promised Col Jer- J
nigan who was'then oaton a scouting jevrty to as- |
sist him, in case he was attacked. At three o'clock !
in tho evening firing was heard at a short dis- .
taneo, which was supposed to Ikj an engagement i
between the afore-mcntioned scouting jwrty and
the Indians, ('apt. Garinony immediately set '
oil'011 foot with his forty men, who after proceed-,|
;.w. l>;il(*a mile. discovered several Indians.
who retreated towards a branch to their main bo- i
dy, consistingef about r?50. The whitesadvanc. !
cd and attacked them, when a battle of more than
two hours duration ensued. It was evideut from
the moverneuts of the enemy, that their object 1
was to out flmk and surround the command of
('apt Garmotiy, who ordered a retreat back to j
the house. The Indians pressed upon his men
keeping a regular tire, which was returned with '
the desperate courage of those who were deter- !
mined to sell their lives as dear as possible. :
Nothing could have exceeded the bravery of this |
little band, who though compiled to retreat, dis- '
puted every inch of ground, and sent many a
tawney savage to his last account. Capt. G. I
whose name will he rcmambercd for his intrepid and
dauntless conduct, slew three of his ni"rci- '
less assailants, after he had retreated to the 1
house?one of them after he had been shot '
down. His men too, no less brave than himself
kept up a constant tire upon their pursuers, until
the arrival of a reinforcement of about twenty !
men from Fort Jones, who charged the Indians i
and relieved for the time ,he exhausted troops
that had fought the first hard battle. This rein-1
forcenient being however too small to contend .
with the overwhelming force of the enemy, were t
compelled to retreat, alter fighting ten to one, for
almost half an hour. In theso engagements |
some twenty-live or thirty Indians arc said to
have been killed. Those who have since visited ;
the battle ground, suppose from the 6ign that !
was left, that the number slain was much groat
or.
Whatever rumor may say of this fight, there
can be no question of one thing, that every man
engaged in it did his duty, and founght w ith a
courage rarely equalled and never surpassed by
inexperienced soldiers. Gwinnett and Stewart
counties have a right to be proud or their sons,
who in the hour of trial, have nobly done and no- j
bly died. J. V, Tate, James II. Holland, Wm. !
Sirums, Jumos M. Allen, Robert T. Holland, j
James C. Martin, Henry W. PeJen, and Isaac i
Lacy, of the Gwinnett Cavalary were killed, and j
Capt Germany, Mr. Alexander, .Vr. Hunt, and!
Mr. Stcpp were wounded. Of tho reinforcement i

THE rilEROK EES.
It. is ascertained that there is a strong sym- i
palhy between the Seminolcs, the Creeks, and
the Chcrokecs. However they may differ from
each other, against the white man they have the
same sentiments of hatred and revenge; and if
tlioy havo any reason to hope for success, tlioy
will unite in hostilities against him. There is a ^
systematic and conlidential intercourse between
1 them. During tho military operations in Fieri- j
da, of the last winter, tho t-hcrokees, through j
their scrcct channels of communication, were
informed of every important event ocetuing at j
) the seat of war, heforo their white neighbours :
I could receive accounts of tlie same transaction j
! by mail. And now the Creeks are informed of (
j the recent depredations committed by the Sem- i
; inolcs in Florida, before the events arc made
! known to us through our regular channels of
! communication.
j It is not doubted, that the failure of the late
j campaign in Florida has emboldened the Creeks
, to plunder uml destroy tho property, and to shed
: tho blood of the whites. Under this state of
; things it is the part of prudence to observe the
i Clierokecs with a watchful and suspicious eye,
! even though they might appear to bo quiet and
I peaceable. But thev have in fact given strong
i indications of hostility which cannot safely be
! ovcrlohkcd. Since the faluiro of Florida cam
i paign, and the temporary succcs of the Creeks
in Alabama' and on our western frontier the
Clierokees in Murray and oilier counties in which
i they are numerous, have become sulky and in!
t?olcnt, and have declared that they will burn the
I houses of the whites, and do as much damage as
possible. The Ross-iucn say, that Ross has told
' them that their land should never bo sold: and
i that rather than leave it, as required by the trea.
ty, and by tho laws of Georgia, the)' will die
fighting on it. It is believed by those wbo are
well acquainted with tlicm, that all the chiefs
who signed the late treaty will be put to death by
i the myrmindous of Ross if they venture to return
! to tlicir homes During tho last few weeks,
, about three hundred Creeks have made a lodgmout
in the Coosawattce valley, in the county of
j Murray. Of this party, the men (how nuruer
ous, we are not infonned)arc well armed with
ritles. They avoid intercourse with the whites,
and arc suspected of exasperating the Cherokccs.
Our citizens in thoso thinly settled regious arc
justly alarmed at the dangers which surround
f them; and many families think of abandoning
their homes and seeking'safety at a distance from
these savages.?Ibid.

A message, it is said, was recently for- j

ward at Tuskegee, saving to him in sub-!

stance that if be and his nien were Iriend-,

upon receiving the message the old chief .
made an attempt to carry his party as desired,
but could not get more than about
three hundred to join him, the remainder,
(about live hundred,) determined to fight.
It is further said that Neah-Micco finding,
his party so generally hostile became apprehensive
for his personul safety, and
finally slipped away from them during the
night, with a few friends, and made his
escape to Tuskegce, where he is now
with, in all, about one hundred of his people.

About thirty men and as many
women and children, who are friendly,
i from Neah-Micco's camp, have come in
to thp friendly Indians encamped opposite
this city. Others have gone to Fort

A gentleman, arrived on Tuesday cven|
ing from Lumpkin, in Stewart county, and
I who is well acquainted with the Indian
; character, states that he saw several trai
ces of Indians on the road, passing from
the river into the interior of Georgia. He
' supposes they are parties of Jim Henry's

their negroes and other booty to Florida.

A very fine company of volunteers, consisting
of upwards of one hundred active
young men, chiefly residents of this city, under
the command of Capt. E. B. Robinson,
formerly of Virginia, embarked in the steamer
Columbia, on Monday last, for Norfolk,
on their way to the scene of Indian hostilities
in the South. These young men, of
whom a considerable portion came from
Virginia for the express purpose of joining
the corps, formed themselves into a military
company, elected their officers, tendered
their services to the President lor the Indian
war, were accepted, armed, mustered into
service, and have promptly set out ou their
patriotic errand.?National Intelligencer.
From the Floridian.
A proposition has been made to introiJuce
the Cuba bloodhound. The necessity
of having recourse to this lerocious animal
is to be deplored; but whatever may be the
issue of the present war, that necessity will
still exist. Should the Seminoles be obliged
to submit, they will not be allowed to
carry with them the slaves which they have
captured. The country will still be left infested
with banditti, which can hardly be
exterminated by any other means. While
the war lasts, the employment of this animal
would effectually deter the enemy from separating
into small parties. We should i
have no scruples in calling to our aid a >
brute as ferocious and bood-thirsty as the j
cncniv we have to contend with.
