We might, if we were to sit doi to
the task, enumerate hundreds of lcading
mnen--or men, known ill the political
storms that have past, who were federal
ists, aid ais federalists, opposed to the ad
n inistrations ofJelTerson and Jackson. Is
it any wotiter then. that these politicians
are to be found arrayed against VA. Bu
But an unfledged politician of tile wlhig
school. of the present day, taking his ideas
from certain wvhig presses, which assert all
ihinags which eai aid their party. whether
or not susceptible of proo, will cry out:
We (the whigs) are the Democratic party,
-your party is composed of Federalists.
-We would ask this or that tyro, in what
political school would he rank Daniel
Webster, John Q. Adams, (and since 1824
-Iletiry Clay!) They used to call them
selves National IHepublicans, another natme
lbr Federalists, who aimed at making the
Constitution a nose of wax, to be fashoin

When was Daniel Webster a Democrat

he advocated a high tairilffor revenue, and

the country, which led it to the brink of
ruin?
las it, when he received from Federa
lists, flirteena votes, for President or the
United States, when the Democratic ean

The tray it IWorks.-Soon after the Iit
dependent Treasury Bill went info opera
tion, all the Banks of Charlestou resumed
specie payments. A great meeting has
since been held in Baltimore urging the
Banks there to resume. The New-York
and Eastern Banks all pay specie. The
following is the opinion of the leading
Whig commercial paper in the United
States, the Journal of Commerce:- '
"It must he confessed, that since the
Suh-Treasury Bill was passed, there has
been quite a revival of business in mer
chandize, and an advance in prices; but a
very retrogade movement in stocks."
Exactly the effect that the democracy of
the country contended that the measure
would produce-cherish and protect tlie
btb)incss and the business men of the coun
try, and prevent or check the operations
olstock gamblers and speculators."
Who can now say that this Bill is inju
rius to Banks and trade! The system
works well-is beantiful in theory and
beneficial in practice!

In relation to this declaration of Gen. Har

In the Princess Ann, (Somerest, Md.)
Herald of Tuesday, we find the following
statement in reference to a singular and
extraordidary case of formation of a new
eye ball:
A Great Phenomenon.-Our readers will
remember, that during this summer, the
the strange renewal of the eye, of our fel
low citizens. Captain George Davey, has
been a subject of discussion in the newspa
pers. The statements which have been
made, are not in all particulars true. He
has been appealed to, and gives the follow
ing statement, to be found in the letter of
Mr. Hardy. Capt. Davey is one of our
most respectable citizens, and the state
ment he has furnished, of this extraordina
ry phenomenon, may be implicitly relied
00.
Dear Sir-You may have noticed In va
rious papers, statements in relatic i to the
new eye (as he calls ii) of our worthy citi
zen, Capt. George Davey. Capt. Davey
has seen some of the statements and pro
nounces them to be inaccurate. He has
given me the state of the case which I
send you, this day, and express a wish to
have it published that any errors in fact.
may be corrected; aid that the exceedintt
singularty of the case may be made
known. The case may give rise to val
nable investigations of this delicate organ
of fhe human system. D inhiless many
will be the speculations pertaining to) it.
It is necessary to say here that Capt. Da
vey is a highly respectable. worthy and in
telligent man.
Stalement.-,In the year of 1779
about the last of March, when I was about
ten years and nine moinths old-an infla
mation fell upon the eye ball of my right
eye and continued in high degree for about
six weeks, giving exceeding great pain
during the whole time. At ihe expiration of
six weeks, supperation took place, and a
discharge of corrupt puss. About the end
of'another six weeks, when the eye ball
was completely gone, and the socket
sunken. my father discovered a new eye
-resemiling a bead or bird's eye.
StranR'a n ----., e..1.1ca, me discovery
was real: and the miniatlre eye grew un
iii about the middle of Jily when it at.
itained irs perfect size and the vision was
as clear and disticit an ever it hal been
.Inl so continued for eiahteen months. AL
this time however I was taken with se
cond inflamation in both eyes. occasioned
by haihing tefore I had entirely recovered
froi the small pox. This produced a
thick strong film over the new eye ob
sitrucing my vision in for about 58 years.
For the lait seven or eight years the film
spoken of has appeared to decrease until
I can now distinguish different shades im
perfectly. [ can even now see tolerably
well through a Telescope or Microscrope;
hitt it is remarkable that no spectacles out
of the great numbers I have' tried, have
ever alorded me any asuistance. I use
occasionally a thick cotnvex glass, but with
little aid. I am now about seventy two
years of age."

The Boston Atlas cautions the public

The being alluded to above, was for
somec time employed in this alike, as an
apology for a journeyman compositor.
Subsequently, we have heard, he preamu
bulated the uipper part of this State, deliv
ering Lectumres on Palistine, and professing
to be an Egyptain by birth [his success
in gulhing the people enmboldetned him to
follow up the business, as we have seen
advertisements in the Norfolk and Rich
mnond papers, annotuncing the delivery of
Lectures, a la .Baclainghwnm in those cities.
He visited Charleston a few months since,
and in his e',nversation with his comnpan
ions, stated that his mode of getting a liv
ing was much easier and more profitable
than to labor for it; and if reports can be
relied on, some of his fallow boarders found
that what cost them somec labor to obtain,
he relieved them of the trouble of retain

A certain Dr. Eli S. Davis, formerly of
Abbeville, S. Carolina, but nowv of Ten
nesse, has changed from a democrat to a
whig, and also becotme a candidate for
Congress, andl some of our whig papers
are niaking a great jolification over the
Dr's conversion. A gentleman wvho knows
[im well informs us that the Doctor is "no
great shakes." -no how,"-that as a poli
tician. he is as marketable as a fish; as a
man, frothy as a beer biottle, and remark
;bh only for having once travelled over
the whole western part of the U. States,
with one dollar; iln which trip lhe visited
the hermitage and received as a present
fromt Gen. Jackson, otno of Col. Earle's
portraits of Gen. J.. which he carried home
andi sol to the lion. Waddy Thllompso~n,
and which portrait, by the way, the said
lIon. Waddy Thompson nowv keeps in his
garrct facing the wall. This same great
accession to the whig ranks did, (we hal
almost forgotten it and beg the Doctor's
pardon for having done so,) one other re
markable feat in his eventful life,-he got
a bundle of hickory sticks, whilst General
Jackson was President, in the woods near
Washington and presented them to the old
chief with a set speech, telling the General
that he had cut them in the Waxhaw set
tlement, South Carnlina, near the place
of his birth.-Marion Al. Herald.
Relation of Husband and Wife.-A
writer in a New England Review, who
expounds the legal Rights of Woman,
showing that he can look at the relatiot
subsisting between the husband and wile
with a true eye, thus beautifully vindicates
the common law, in particular:
"Should either, forgetting the obliga
tions of good faith and all the proprieties of
tl'at relation he willing to bear witness
against the other, the law sternly forbids
it. It will not allow the rule to be viold
led, even by agreement. It has to hand
to raise the evil of that sancity, no ear to
listen to the breathings ofits hollow com.
munion; it lays the hermetic seal of its
finger on the lip that would reveal thoso
secrets. Nay, if the parties themselves
have drained the bitter cup of domestic
dissention, and been finally divorced by a
judicial decree, still neither are permitted
to testify, against the other, to any matter
ofconfidential conmunlication, made while
the marriage tie existed.
lroman.-When we see a neat, pretty
girl, with a free but innocent air-dressed
tastily yet simply-with cheeks which we
can hardly help kissing, and with a pair of
heavenly blue eyes, which seem ro reposo
in perfect security beneath their silketn
lashes, how can we help loving lher. But
when we see a woman whose looks seem&
to say that she is sojouring somewhere a
bout the region of thirty-nine, dressed ofl'in
pink ribbons, mock gold chains, and pinel
back breast pins, and tmincing her steps,
as if treading on eggs, she reminds us
of an old piece of furniture scoured up to
sell.

Caluany and Forgery.-Tho Whigs
have forged expressions and placed thent
in the speech delivered by Van Buren, iti
1827, on the Woollen Bill. They havo
printedi thospeech, called the sheep speech.
so as to read :hat ie had $20,000 invested
in sheep, and that it was his interest to
vote, therefore, for the tariff! The trun
version, aq taken from a copy of that
speech, printed at the time, is, "that ho
(Van Buren) had invested $20,000 in sheep
and sheep fartts, and that it would he per
fectly propet, that he should putrsue his
own interest, achenever he could do so con
sistently with his obligations to his country
-yet hc wCould despise himself if he could
be base enough to fiwor an unsound poliry,
whaterer might be'his own advantage in do
ing so ; and therefore he opposed the policy
so uinjustly called for by the frihtds of thc
Wollen Bill." This is the trtue extratct,
and this well accoutnts foar the eagerness
of the 'friends of the Wollen Bill" to itn
struct him to vote for it ; as they did do.
Truth is indeed mighty, and will prevail.
The Crops.-Thronghbout this country
the crops are better this year than they
have been for many years before. T1he
wheat crop is considerably above the av
erage, in both quantity sand quality.
Other grain, and grass is untsally good.
and the present prospect for corn is that
it will be a greater yield than has been in
thtis country for ten yeats, and wve should
thitnk it would ho ripe fully two weeks
earlier than ttsual. Our farmers will havo
immense surplus to spear, which wve hope
they will be able to fintd a market for.
