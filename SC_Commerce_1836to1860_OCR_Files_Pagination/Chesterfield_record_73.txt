e .use ot the disapprobation ot Christians, | nc
we have music without dancing, there never to;
w as dancing wifhout music. This conncx- re
ion is oft n illustrated, by the circumstance \vi
<>!' persons finding themselves almost irre- j t?\
sis lpiy inclined to accompany with dancing cr
certain strains of music. If poetry and tli
music are 'sificr arts,' it must not bo for- , fa
go ten that the inuse of dancing was sister n<
:o both. The bcautiful conception of tlio ;r1
*mu>ic of the spheres' was formed py one lr
n 'm f It this connexion. The science of hi
motion has been reduced to as complete a it
system as that of sound. , tl
' I; has been objee'ed to dancing, that In
it is a desecration of that which was form- g
erly'a rligiotis exercise. It was just as c<
much a religious exercise as music?-just as pi
much as music nor is?and no more. '1
There were dances expressive ol all tlie i'
d. tie rent scntimen's which arc capable of ft
being prcsst.il by music, even those of! tl
lof'y adoration, as that of David before the r<
nr!\. There is no do'ibt that there was h
once ti dance to the tune of Old Hundred, ri
which we may cauccive to have been as n
solemn and majosio as that noble tune, and p
r-jually worthy of being employed in the c
worship of Almighty lie I. And we hare b
many an herns, and ascriptions of praise |
from King David's Psalms, which we may f,
imagine die Jewish women to have embod- r
led in their dances with sublime cal! ct. j
"Hut because dancing has been used, and j}
may be wst-d again, in religious worship, is (j
that a .reason why we may not express by j y
i" any innocent or amiable emotion? Then, jj
:.s music has been, and wnl he, used in tiie f.
-same manner, it is equally a desecration to n
cxpn'ss our love of our country in a pa- j
iriotic song, our rejoicing at a happy mar- j
riago. in & nuptial song?or our grief at the
4>ji rial of our friends in a dirge. i
"In all countries their have been patri- i #

We presume from the s'rain of tlje tti
foregoing remarks, that the writer may be sj<vass"d
with those professing Christians, ci
who endeavor to justify their early pre- o!
possessions in fivor of an amusement, ki
which was once a source of enjoyment to ' r(
them, bur in which they feel they cannot cc
now participate without creating suspicions m
of their religiuos sincerity, in the minds of it
wore grave and sober Christians, The I tic
q icstioii, therefore, is seriously argued, ; w
whether dancing may not be madoconsis. to
tent with the gravity of a Christian profi-s- be
sion. Our correspondent has probably in- s:
dica ed the train of thought which has led bt
many, who arc externally connected with ec
tlio household of faith, to contennnco in ur
their ton flies this worldly amusement. To d;
the religious aspect of the subject tccreforc, h(
we are invited to direct our remarks. in
Thfe action of the human system in danc- ni
tttg simply considered, is as innocent as any a!
other voluntary motion. To bring the
muscles into healthful exercise, running, fj11
.leaping, or dancing, arc alike harmless in ' ot
h.moral point of view. In admitting this i ni
we arc aware, some will say w? have given 01
up the argument; for if dancing is not in NVi
itselfcriminal, its abuse should not be plead- j he
i'd for its entire disuse among Christians, j 01
Tins however, is a mistake. W e speak i"
merely of dancing as a bodily motion, and rc
entirely disconnected from all its associations.
It can eas<lv be conceived, that n ja
simple, harmless action may, from the uni- 111
lormi'y of i's nppondages, become unad- lei
vised, inexpedient, and even crimianl. In : l*1"
the case of dancing, wc conceive this to!0''
h^true. Bo lily motion, healthful in itself, J ^
has been reduced to a science, and is rcgn- 'm
la'ctl by rules which render it necessary that Pr
a plurali y of persons should ongage. 80. l|c
cieties are thus collected for tlie simple ob- j r0
ic :i of amusement, and with these societies t')
m ?ny objectionable things become insepar- !
ai?iy assweiu cd. The uuvocatesofdancing j I*01
will perhaps interpose nnd say, we are not ! Pr
defending the abuse of the art, but its inno-} ?1
cent ?se. True : but where have we an | pr
example of its innocent use ? where do -we : dc
find it practised without abuse ? In like ; of
manner it has been contended that theatric-' a
fil exhibitions might be enlisted in the cause j
of morals, but where have we ever seen it!
done in fact ? The theatre has always, from ' wl
its earliest history, -been prostituted to the isl
cause of vice,nnd-every attempt to reform bo
rt has been unavailing; hence it is justly ?
condemned as an institution, which, what- j to
ever-ft might bo-rrndcr [*: ropr reg> jhtiort:. i'.o
ver has been, an I as far as experience
aches, never can he brought under these
^illations. This is precisely the case
ith dancing. It has always been produco
of frivolity, thoughtlessness, and even
imc. hiivo a religious or moral cast eier
to it or to theatrical exhibitions, .and the
seination of both is destroyed, to thoss who
i\v indulge in them. Our correspondent
gticson a plausible, but not a probable
vpotliesis. 11'j supposes that dancing may
so fir reclaimed from abuse, as to be
iade the appropriate mode of expressing
ic innocent and amiable emotions of the
cart; wo on the contrary believe, that rearding
human nature us it is, and that in

3J. Dancing as it now is, and as it ever
uist be, is extremely unfriendly to the
nplnntution and nourishment of religious
rinciples and feelings in the minds of the
oung. A stronger contrast could not be
irnishcd than between the dancing room
rtd the family altar, than between the frioli.'ies
necessarily connected with this
rr.uscmcnr, and the serious inculcation ol
ious feeling. How impracticable would it
e to gain the attention of a young person
> reiigion either hefore or after a dancing
ar y ? and why this peculiar reluctance unss
there be in the thing itself something un.
iendly to piety ? All who have experience
i this matter, must admit the justness of
tir remark : and manv parents havo lamcn
d the graceless habi's of their children,
hen they themselves have laid the foundaon
of ilicm, by making dancing a part of
teir education.
Tlius to encourage children in dancing,
pcratcsdisndvnntageously on their intellecml,
moral, and religious character. Wo
>enk, of course, of dancing as it is, and wc
mnot well speak of it in any other point
f view. We can appreciated only from its
lown and uniform tendencies. Our cor.
rspoadent may be able in bis mind, to disDiincct
its " essential part" from what is
icrely incidental, hut he cannot accomplish
in practice. The world has already sot.
:d what arc the uses of dancing, and it
ould require many Luthcrs to induce them
regard it in any other light. Ir cannot
xtome the means of mora! or religious in.
ruction, and therefore it should lie avoided
the Christian. If it were a religious
rcmonv under the Jewish dispensaiion,
idor tho Christian. wo honr nf flu* nnr>
ince only, which cost Joiin tlic Baptist his
ad. A nd now, however professing Chrisms
may plead, that ins'ruction in this art
ay be necessary to a polished education,
id" to obviate awkwardness and rusticity in
e manners of their children, they would not
stily the practice in themselves. They at
ice see how incongruous it would be for
en and women professing godliness, to
igngc in an exercise, which to say the least
as so opposed to the gravity and sobriety
>coniiug the Christian character. With
le word to Christian parents we dismiss
c subject. While you make your ehildn
proficient in the art of dancing how can
>u complain, if to the neglect of impornt
duties, thev take every opportunity of
dulging their taste and displaying their tant
? While you throw them into the cm ace
of the world, how can you be surprisI
that they cast off all care for their souls ?
'lien you permit them to mingh with proi?cuous
society in the dance, how can you
av that they may not be led into tempta>n?
Intlie training of your children you
st under fearful responsibilities, and if
rough vour indiscretion, their souls should
dost, immitigable will be your grief. "Con.
rm not to the world" in its questionable
ncticos, and " avoid even the appearance

All the Ladies who may engage in this

would confer a tribute of respect, it would
remove from the officers the ncccssin o)

for this purpose, are requested tc

" John Forsyth, the Secretary of Stater
. (sent in yesterday his resignation, in a note
addressed with the uncourteous superscript
, lion, " Mr. Van Bur en. President of the lfStatesA
copy of this, together with an
(address from Mr. Forsyth to the citizens
. of Georgia, was sent t<? the Globe,- and
would have appeared this morning, had it
| not been suppressed the evening before bir
! consent of parties. What concessions wer?
; made by Van Barcn to Forsyth, or how
the storm was quieted, I am unable to say;
but the facts as I relate them to yon art*
substantially correct-"
From the Journal of Commerce.
Washington, March 10.
" I understand that tlie ostensible ren:
son given by Mr. Forsyth, in the letter;,
for his resignation, was, that he had understood
it to be Mr. Van Burcn's declared
policy to have no individual iu his Cabi~
net who aspired to the Presidency ! * *
* There are probably other grounds for
; Mr. Forsyth's discontent; for it has long
j been known, that, as a member of Genoral
Jackson's Cabinet, his relations towards
Ins colleagues were not of the most
( cordial character."
Having copied the above, it appears
I proper that we should add what is said
and surmised on the subject by the Ad'
ministration journal in New York, the
, Kvcning Post,
i From
the Xetc York Evening Post.
I " The Washington letter writers in the
! Opposition journals have a story that Mr.
1 Forsyth, on Thursday last, sent in to the
President a resignation of his post as Secretary
of State, and, at the same time,
sent to the Globe newspaper an address to
j tlie citizens of Georgia. Mr. Forsyth,
. however, it is added, was prevailed upon
: to withdraw his resignation, and tho ad|
dress was not published. * * *
** It is added that the immediate cause
of Mr. Forsyth's resignation was the odcr
of a mission to Austria, which he considered
as a contrivance to get rid of him. *

W'c are fallen on singular and anomalous
times. In the midst of unexampled prosperity,
when all the avenues of trade are
! open, when money is abundant for the ordinary
operations of commerce, we are cal;
led upon tb record several extensive failures
involving an amount almost alarming
to the general credit. On Saturday, one
of our largest and most influential house*
failed for seven millions carrying with it
full five millions more. When* and where

lor speculation has been so great that ihero
is no estimating the amount of responsibilities
incurred. It does not appear tobavo
been confined to real cs'ate. Overtrading
in the staple articles of the country on the
part of a favored few lias led to this dis.
astrous state of things. Yet in the midst
of these extraordinary" failures, the business
of the country is going on steadily. This
is a proof of the stability of our mercantile
friends. It is thought that some of the
houses which have s opped payment will
be able to resume business in a few days.
As may be * expected. Cotton operations
under such circumstances are not
likely to nourish. No sales were recorded
