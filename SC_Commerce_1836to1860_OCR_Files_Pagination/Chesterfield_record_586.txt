ItfrOJlTAST INVRNTION IN MAOHISKRV.
Oar attention lias been called, by an
article in one of the provincial newspa
pars, tr? an important mechanical invon(ion.
(<?r which a patent ins recently been
granted to |vvo .Scotch gantderoSn, and
which promises to oiled a greaf.er and
more beneficial change in the working of
machinery than has' taken nlace since
toe brilliant discoveries of Watt. The
two great drawbacks ??f tnc steam engine,
besides the largo space it occupies, have
been til * hulk and tin? consequent expense
of tiie fuel which it requires?the latter
preventing its application fo many pur.
poses for which it would .otherwise have
b<*en a most effective ag.^st, and the former
impeding its locornolrve cnergv, and
confining it. particularly, a* regards navigation,
within comparativelvrnarrow limits.
Any reduction in either of these respects
is therebv obvious!v so much clear
nr:nn Tim invention to which we allude
promises to effect a prodigious saving in
bo!h9 l?y diminishing the cxpondilure of
fuel to somewhat loss than nine-fifth of
what is now required foi an equal decree
of power. It has already, we are informed,
been put to;he lest by the contraction
of an engine of about twenly horse'pow.

all the machinery of an extensive foiorjdry,
with no larger consump'ion than we
have just mentioned, and with every pnm*.
poet of a considerahiy greater reduction
being effected bv gome slight changes in
the details. Tire motive power mad js

great advantage of the new- engine
arises from a saving of space equal to
what is usually occupied by the furmwe
and boilers of a steam engine. If these
tilings be so, it is impossible to calculate
the results to which so important a discovery
