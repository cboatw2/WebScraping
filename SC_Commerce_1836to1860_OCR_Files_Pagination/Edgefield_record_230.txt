--WAsaNoToN, Jan. I .
h Womsiho.,bill.-was-agai under
distassion in the Senate to-day. Hither
to, the bruntof the debate has been borte
by Mr.Clap, of Kentucky, es the cham
a of the old States; but, to-day; Mr.
Preston caffie-to his support, in a most a
ble and effective style. Mr. Preston op
posed the entire principi add policy of tlhe
sneasure, as unjust an ~ rious to the
old States, and espJi je States of
Virginia and the , ns,uanias a viola
tion of the acts o 4 - and oftthe Con
stittition. d enswer -ti. e argument that
all nations had favored *policy of colo
nization, he maintained that the Federal
Government had no right to c0ouize the
people of South-Carolina upon the lands
belonging in part, to South-Carolina, nor
to reduce or force her people to emigrate
to the new'States-for it amounted to force,
when the policy of the Government was to
withhold troin the State her proper portion
of the public domain-to create a drain
upon her resources, and thus to make it
aecemsary for her people to emigrate. He
said that he would prefer that the now.
States would takse.the lands by, some bold
and open measure, than take them insidi
ously add-piece-meal, by such a measure.
oRive spoke very warmly and
dcidedly in opposition to the whole
scheme, as a direct violation of the land
system which bad .been establisded for for
ty years, and under which the States had
prospered to an extent that ought to satisfy
then, and which was unexatapled in the
principle of discrimination between classes
of titizens, as to the price of the lands,
which wevs.now, for the first time. attemp
ted to be introduced.
The Hasse then - resumed the considera
tion of the resolutions under discu.,sion
yesterday, providing for the printing of
0 twenty-thousand extra copies or certain
public documents, having reference to de
falcations... The debate was prevented
from obttining any greater growth thau it
has already acquired, by the demand for
the previous question; which was called
for b Mr. MITCHELL, of New York, and
the documents were ordered to be printed.
The House passed on to the special or
ders of tbe,,day (heing several bills reported
from thet-Nival Committee) and went into
Committee thereon. The discussion on.
the bill for the improvement of the Navy
Yard at Brooklyn, and for constructing a
I*y Dock therein, was resumed and con
tinued for several hours with much anitna
tion. Mr. Evans, of Maine, first held the
floor, and commenced in reply to some
remarks which felllfrom Mr. W. Thomp
son,yeserday, in regard to the liberal
spirit which Congress had exhibited to
wards the South in the appropriation of
th public monies.
Mr. fegare followed Mr. Evans. in a
snaster speech, a portion of which was
directed to the advantages possessed by
Charleston as a seat for a naval depot and
dry dock.' After this, the amendment of
Mr. Thompson, for an appropriation of
$100,000 for the navy yard aL Pensacola,
was rejected, and also the amendment of
Mr. Paynter, of Penn., for a like sum for a
dry dock at Philadelpnia. The bill was
then laid aside, anti after pasing over
several other bills without amendment, the
Committee rose and teported, and the
House adjourned.
JANUARY. 12.
Mr. Curtis, of New-York, moved a
suspension of the rules, to enable him to
submit a motion for the printing of not ex
tra number of certain additional Reports
from ahqTreasury Department in relation
to the ease of Mr. Swartwout. It is asser
ted that, according to these documents, Mr.
-Swatwout retained the oilice of Collector
for three years itihout having given the
proper bonds. The House refused to
suspend the rule by 107 yeas, against 77
nays, (the rule requiring atn af1irmation
vote of two- thirds.)
.Beyond this all was private business.
January 14.
Th's Senate to day, was tunexpectedly
engage.d in a discussion uipon the Noril:
Carolina resolutions, against the ex punging
act of the Senate, 'and against the Sub
Treasury Scheme, and the graduation bill.
I1fr. Brown, of North Carolina, present
ed the resolutions and stated his regret th-it
the resolutions were not drawn ini a mnore
respectfol manner, and took particular ex
ception to the expression of' the opinion
by the Legislature, that the expunging
p recess was an "act of servility" to the
Exec;utive. lie thought the Legislature
wyas wvanting in proper comtity due from
one. body to another. As to the bearing
of the resolutions upon him and his col
league, he h-ad made it an anxious sub
. jeet of consideration, and had come to the
conclusion that they were not mandatory
and instructive in their character, but
merely an expression of the opinion of the
individual members of the majority of the
Legislature on the subject. Acknowlrdg
sag the right of instruction, in its fuillest
extent, he should resign his seat if lie held
thdae to be itnstructions; but thme word "in
struct" was not used in the resoluations,
and no other mandatory word. Wheni t he
* Legislature, in fortmer times, passed in
structions, they (lid it in an open and *iold
manner, and used the word "instruct."
But in both Houses, this word wais mroved
as an.amendmecnt andi the opposition vo
te'd against it.
Mr. Stranigo took a similar view of the
character of the resolutions, iIe said they
were not binding as instructions, not beiig
in the form of mstructionis. iIe said too,
that the Senate, in exptinging the remolim
tons of cenisut u n Gen. Jackson, only
obeyed the inat s of the majority of
*the States; he ws .oflis partticipn-.
tien-in that act, avoted untder a res
olution of instructiol from the General
Assembly of North Carolina, . hich stood
umrepealed. lie shouild hiave resigned,
If. he had been positively instructed to go
against wvbat lie considered a p)roper coturse
itt this matter, but, as it was, he did not
fee,called upon, in a cowardly moanner; to
desert his -post, an-l give it up to an adver
sary. At the next session of the Legisla
t:ire, hie wouild, however, give thpm an op.
.,pOrt.pguty to make their election between
a Pederaslilt antd a lemtocrap;-dteeesi a

Mis~trati ASp *o Graduaton bill,

ento werO 4ppoo to that and heihould
vote agahAst It.
Mr Clay, of Kentuckf,*-nade a few.re
marks, in a very sarcastic n.anner, upon
what had fallen frojn the North Carolina
Senators. As North Carolina had no re
presentative here upon this particularsub.
ject, and as the resolution met his entire
approbation, he would, lie said, make a
few observations in their defence against
the animadversions of the Senators. The
expunging act he pronounced to be an act
derogatory to the dignity of the Senate;
and, as to the form of the instructions, he
contended that, according to the republican
doctrine of 1798, it was a sufficient in
struction for the people to express their
wishes in any form. Mlessrs. Brown and
Strange made severe replies, and the reso
lutions were ordered to be printed. -The
Graduation bill was taken up, and the mo
tion to postpone it indefinitely was lost 23
to 27.
The House-was engaged, exclusively,
in calling the States for resolutions. A
vast number of Resolutions were offered,
one of which. proposed by Mr. Lewis
Williams, condemned the abuse of the lil
erty of talking in the House, and recom
mended it to tie members to go home un
less they would act, instead of talking.

WASHINGTO, Jan. 15.
The motion for raising a select Cotumit
tee of Inquiry into the recent Defalcations,
was taken up in the Hfouse,ofrtepresenta
tives to-day, and called forth some of the
most animated, interesting, and eloquent
discussion.
Mr. Legare, who was entitled to the
floor, advocated the appointment of the
Committee by ballot.
lie then proceeded to shew that the ap
pointment of a Committee by hallot, was
no violation of precedent or of principle,
but in strict conformity with the law.
lven if tihe rule had been different, this
was a case to jnstify a departure from it.
The Speaker was, as every body knows,
elected by the party power; and appomnted
Committees for the purpose or carrying
out the views of the Executive. The pro
position now is, that the -louse should act
as Inquest; and gentlemen stand up and
contend that tihe Executive is to come
here and appoint the committee which is
to examine into its doing! And this is
thought to be so much a matter of course,
that the financial organ of the Executive
thinks it not worth his while to say a word
about it.
The case to be examined is a most ex
traordinary one. A man against whom,
it appears, suspicion has always.existed,
is appointed and re appointed. Did the
susilcions that attached to his character,
make him the object of vigilant observa
tion? Not so; the farthest from it possible.
For three years of the time he was carry.
ing on his imperial depredations, he had
not given the hotds required by law!
Mr. Legare maintained, that with the
facts that were known to the country, Mr.
Woodhury could not come into the House
with clean hands. He came with pre
sumptions against him which ought to be
repelled; and he thought that gentleman's
friends had done him gross injuijica. by
their manner of proceeding. IIe referred
to the ridicule with which the House hail
received the declaration of Cu.shman the
other day, that the Secretary was ready
to meet any investigation, provided the
Committee should be appointed by the
Speaker.
Mr. L. then noticed the argument of Mr.
F. Thomas, that the administration being
most interested in finding the money and
catchitig the thief, oughtt to lbe allowed to
have the direction of the inqumiry.
Here Mir. F. T. arose and said, he spoke
of the ft-iends of the administration in the
House.
Mr. Legare replied that it was no matter.
The argument was utterly inconsequential
and sintapplicable to the racts of the case, and
if tIhe course of ;he administratiotn was tom
rest on such reasonhing, it ought to be a
bandoned in despair.
As to Thomas's attempt to place the
criminality of Swartwout on other shot
ders, besides those or the administration
it was a perfect lfnilure. The confirma
tion of the appointminent by the Senate,
could tiot exonerate the admnisi?trtiont.
Ac ay rate the facts conanected with this
a ppointmnet and( re-apppoin tment, could
nmot be ascertained, but b)y a searching
operation..
. Mr. Legare in conclusioti, alluided in
an eloquent manner to the prmises Mr.
P'ickens had givena of stupport to the propo..
sition for rasmng a commiittee by ballot.
Mr. Cambrelenig tnow rose and p)roposed
that the committee shouald he app)ointed by
the House viva woce.
Mr. WVise declared that 'atmbreleng
was cornered at last. Hie pretended lie
wvantedl itvestigation! andi itt order to se
cure it he proposed it in suach a form 'as to
require the assent of t wo thirds, instead of
a simnple ma'jority of tIme Hlouse!
Mr. Ogden Hoffman then rose, and in
a speech of uncommon eloquence, replied
to the arguimenits of those who had op..
p)osed the appointment by the Houise.
Mr. Hloflman spoke of the character Mr.
Swvartwoutt had sustainted before the late
decvelopments, itn highly favorable ternms;
anid expressed a confident belief that a large
amotunt of the lato defalcationis went into
the hands omf others. Mr. S. (he said) had
as a piartner itn his conademniation, oine ol
the warmest friends of the Administration
wvho had continued to be s) dIowa to the
very last election. Mr. Swarmwout never
had acted with tihe Whigs. The mer
chats hatd fomnmd him kinid, obliginig anid
attenttivo.in his intercourse and they re
turned this wvith c'orresp)onintg kindness!
Mr. HIolmnan demanded whether these
mterchants we-re nowv to he tauntemd with
trustintr him andm treating him favorably,
after Ito hadl been, appointed amid re-al).
polintedl to an itmportanmt amid resp)onsible
office by thme Admitnistration?
The debate was continued by Messrs.
Prentiss anid Underwvood-the latter gave
way to a motioni for adjournment at 5o'
clock.
M.Cushmman said a fewv wordIs against the
appointment of the conmmittee bty tIme
IHouse, andl again declared that the Sec
retary was,wilting 10-ineet any7 investiga
tion-coniductedj y 'a-committee appointed

in the Senate, to day, Mr. Calhoun.
spoke on the subject. of the 'Gradulktiou
Bill. His views were, aa usual, strongly
and truly expressed, and he 'command
ed much attention; though to 4oihe por
tioni'of his remarks a murmur of dissent
was audibly heard. He set out with the
position that the present laud systega, how
ever wise it might have been at it1 origin,
is unsuited to the present condition of the
new States. lie took a view of their
growth, and the consequenees Ailowing
their unparalelled prosperity. .,.Three
more new States were about to apply for
admissijb,-aud the number of their Sena
ts would then be owenty-four-two filths
ofthe whole brody. Of7the members ot
the House of Representatives, they would
also have two-lifths, under the next census.
Their weight in the Electoral 'College
would also be two fifths. He coptrasted
this degree of steigth with that which the
new States possessed, when he came into
Congress, only twenty, seven years ago.
Then they had ouiftgle Representative,
Jeremiah Morrow, of Ohio, whose word
was law, in regard to all the questions con
cerning the public lands. I
This extraordinary growth had aot been
expected, but would, every year,receive
a new impulse. The census of 1850 would
give the new States the majority 4foneou
bers of the House of Representgaves.
The West would then hold the baace of
power. Would it be practicable asked,
to maintain the prel,ent land systew under
such circumstances! lie went onko show
that it would lead to every species of cor
rupition and contention-especial in re
gard to the Presidential question. Some
of the caudidates would promiseI all the
lands to the West, and others-would ap
peal to the rights and interest V.the old
States. The political interests of -%e new
States would be brought into deadly con
flict with those of the oldLStalesM,ud the
new States would triumph and the old
States be oppressed. This was tfe great
evil to be guarded against. lie went on to
give his remedy for the evil, viz: cesson
of the lands to the new States on fair and
equitable terms. He opposed the present
bill, and gave notice that, at the com
tnencement of the next Seseion, he shiould
bring forward, in detail, the proposition
which he now indicated.
Mr. Bayard flullowed Mr. Calhoun anil
the bill was ordered to be cngrussed-27
to 22.
The louse resumed the consideration
of t he resolution appointing a Select com
mittee to investigate the recent defalca
tion in the port of New York.
The debate (which ran through the
whole day) was continued by Messrs. Un
derwood, Toucy, Martin, Biddle, and
Duncan, the last of whom hael not conclu
led, when, at 5 o'clock. he gave %ay to a
motion for ajournment, which prevailed.
So no question was taken.
January. 17.
In the Senate, to-day, Mr. CLAr, of
Ky., spoke at length against the gradua
tion bill which was ovits passage. lid re
plied to Mr. Calhoun's remar!is of yester
day, and contended that he had esaggera
ted the evils of the land -4ystem and mis
taken the remedy for thom. He wemit in
to some views and staillelt to that
the progress of the present lai* wmyaen
would remove all the evils antia6d.
Thus. Ohio, having only seventeen hun
dred acres of public land in her litijt.,
would not for the purpoie of getting pos
session of it, strrender tier claim to the three
hundred millions of acres within the new
states and territories, to say nothing of the
vast domain beyond the territories, as each
new state filled up and as the public lands
within her limits were transferred to pri
vate hands, such state would feel a cotm
mon interest with the old states in the per
servation of the public dotrain. But thre
remaedy of the gentleman wenti beyotid tIhe
evil, and would produce the very result
wvhieb it was inatended to prevet-i. e
contention, corruption, and the final loss to
the old states of the whole domain. To
prevent the new state's from seizing upon
the lands, the gentlemna proposes to give
thenm up) voluntarily-this w ;as like pere
scribing death as the cure for all diseases.
iie warned the gentleman, that tIhe rein
tion of debtor and creditor wich lie piropo
sed to estatalish hetween the states and the
general government, was the most*danger
ons one that could possibly exist--and
wouldl soeon cnd itn a general scene of con
tention and disunion.
Mr. Calhoun replied in furthe-r support
of his plan). Mr. Be-nton made some remtarks
in opposition to Mr. Calhoun's motion.
The debate was countitnued by Menssrs.
King, Niles and Buchanean, after which the
bill was passed-yeas 27. tnays 22.
In the floLse of Rtepresentatives. The
Camittee otn _Foreign Allaire (through
Mr. Le'g:ere) made a report, asking to lie
discharged from the fturther consmideration
of a memitoriail which hade been re-ferred ton
them; in favoir of the establhishme,nt of a
Cengress oif nations for the settlement of
naetionial disptutes. The Committee, it ap
pears. hadl mtade a repoit on the same sub
ject at the last session of Congress,.-which
however there is reasotn to believe had not
reached the petitioners. A tmotion was
mande by Mr. Adams to recommiat the re
port that tIhe Commtit tee on Foreigna A (Vairs
ihlt cotnnect with it various memorials,
which hail been referred ton them-t, for the
ediation of thre U. States in the existitng
cottroversy between Frarnee ail Mexico.
Mr. Legare explained that this part offthe
suject was at prresent tinder consideration
in thre Committee. and Mr. Adatms then
withdrew Iris motion to reconmmrit.
The h ouse resumted the conisidleration
of the resolutioni lor the appiintmment of at
Select Committee on the recent defalca
tions. Mr. Dunc-an restumed his remarks,
and occupied the attentioni of the fleuee
for about threo hours. Some further de
bate followed-w hen the qutest ion was ta
ken. The amendeim to ele--'t siva vore
wvas rejected, ande the amendment to elect
by ballot adopted.
January 18.
In the Senate, Mr. Hubbard suggestd
that the condit ion of the Tlreasury was stuch
as to renider extreme econonmy necessary,
andn he moved to reduce the approprition

Tits LiGHTNINo TrLFoAPH.-An As

Philadelphia to establish a line of the Elec

fes%or Morse, between those two cities.
The distance the wire is to be laid is 100
miles. The Association are to pay Pro
fessor Morse .8200 per mile, or $20,000 for
the exclusive right between the two cities,
which is to be sirrensdered to the United
Stat es. if during the present session Coni
gress shall assume the exclusive right of
establishing the Telegraph frosn Wa;shing

the wires is esimnatedl at $520 per mtile, a

Professsr Morse estimnases the power of
the Telegraph egntal to commntslicasiing 415
letters per miintute, 317,500 per day, which,
at onie cenut a letter for postage, would yield
$138.00I0 per annusm, dedneting one' half

To She Patrons or the dgeAted
A d v e -tis e r.
Having been elected bythe LeVislature
of South Carojina. to an Office which will
require ny personal attention, I am com
~lied to dissolve my connexion with the
blic, as Editor of the Edgefield Adver
It is now three years sibce this Pa
wqs established, and for this period, I
have been responsible for Its conduct and
management. I entered upqn the dise
charge of my editorial duties with a lively
sense of my responsibiljtjes, and experienco
ins but deepened the conviction, that few
osihions in life are more important. How
these duties have been discharged, it be
comes me not to speak.
My brother, P. F. LABORDE, who hag -
had the control of the Paper for a few
touths past, will now become its respon
sible Editor. A proper modesty will not
forbid tie from saying, that he is a gentle
man of liberal education, and in every re
spect well qualified for the station.
In surrendering my important trust, I
must express my thanks for the generous
support which has been given the Edge
field Advertiser, and ask for it, the con
tinued patronage o'the community.
M. LABORDE.
The Head Quarters of Governor Noble,
will in future be at Abbeville C. House.
We are indebted to the Hon. F. W.
Piekens, for a copy of a Public Document,
on the subject of Lands ceded to the Uni
ted States. Also for a copy of the letter
of the lion. Mr.Shepard, "To the freemen
of the 4th Coigressional District of North
Carolina."

gentlemen have been appointed by the
Governor. Directors on the part of the
State; Dr. ''. M. Robertson. J. B. Bishop,
and Thomas Barrett.
Governor Gilmer, of Georgia, has issu
ed an order, calling for volunteers to pro
tect the country near the Okefonokee.
Gen. Floyd. in a letter to the Governor.
roays, that 500 Infantry, and 300 mounted
men, are sufficient to guard the frontier,
and continue the exploration of the Oke
fonokee Swamp.
Free Banking Lato.-The Milledgeville
Standard of Union says, that two compa
nies have already been formed, under the
act of the last session; one at West Point,
in Troup County, the other in Decatur
County. -
Excessire Legislation -At its recent
session, the Georgia Legislature passed
only two hundred Acts.
At its late sessio i, the Legislature of
Georgia passed an Act, to call a Conven
tion in A pril next, to reduce the number
of Mem bers of the General Assembly.
Bleeding thec Treasury.--The cost of
the Mormon wvar in Missouri, amounts to
about $80,000. The Governor of Mis
souri. says that the United States are lia
ble for this amount, on the groumnd that
the General Government is bound to sup
press inlsurrection. If the Government
pays all the demands against it, there will
not be aniother Surplus shortly.
Old Rip Van Winkle awcake!-- We
strongly sutspect that Old Rip was in a pro
found slumber, when the North Car- I
olina Senators voted in favor of tha
f.amotus Expunging Resolutions. The
old centlemnan appears just to have a
wakened from his long sleep. He lately
jumnped fromt his couch, and swore in his
wra,th. that the Exputiging Resolutions
should be erpunged instanter.
It is a bad Rule that will not work both
aeays.--When the Sub-Treasury Resolu
tions were passed by the Legislature of S.
Carolitna. and her delegation in Congress
were requested to vote in conformity to
them, many of the Whigs cried out pro.-.
scription ! proscription ! It will be remem
tiered that the Legislature of N. Carolina,
lately passed by a bare majority, Resolu
tiou3s against the Sub-Treasury. That
bod y d id not positirely instruct the N. C..
Se'nators, who are Sub-Treasury men, to
vote againsat the Sub-Treasury, or resigo.
Becaause these Senators did not imme
ditately vacate their seats, the Whig edi
tors p)ouredl out the vials of their wrath,
upon their heatds. They did not cry out
persectution, persecution in thiscase! This
would nothave suited them. Comment1s
needless.
The Pendleton Messenger says, thdt
Getn. Rusk and Col. Bee, now holding

Iowa.-A serious difficulty has arisen be
tweetn Goveronr Ltucas, and the Lecisla---#
ttire. The Governor says, that all ptublic
acts must have his signature. TbIs is de
