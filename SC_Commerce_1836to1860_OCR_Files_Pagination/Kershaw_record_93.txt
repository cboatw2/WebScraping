Deaf Smith of Texas.?From a young
man recently returned to this city from
Texas, who was for some considerable
time in Smith's company, we learn that
this eccentric individual was originally
from Catskill, in this State?that he went
into that country w.hen it was all a wilderness.

twenty years, and from having been n
hunter and a trapper, he made himself
familiar with every nook and corner of
the country, lie is about fitly years of
age, has married a Mexican woman and
has a numerous family. -He neither aspires
to nor will accept of any office, although
he has had many offers, lie has
,proved himself to bo a man of extraordinary
courage in many encounters, and
great rcliunce is placed in his judgment,

The Man of Integrity is one who J
makes it his constant rule, to follow the j
road of duty, according as the word of t
God, and the voice of his conscience, r
point it out to him. He is not guided
merely, by affections, which may some- J
times give the color Qf virtue,to a loose f
and unstable character. The upright man j,
is guided hv a fixed principle of mind, .

which determines nrm to esteem nothing t
but what is honorable, and to abhor whatever
is base or unworthy, in moral conduct.
Hence we find him ever the same
at all times ; the trusty friend, the affectionate-relation,
the conscientious man of
business, the pious worshipper, the publicspirited
citizen. He assumes no borrowed
appearance. He seeks 110 mask to
cover him, for he acts no studied part ;
but he is indeed wli it be appears to l>e?
full of truth, candor and humanity. In
all his pursuits, be knows no path but the
fair and direct one ; and would much rather
fail of success, than attain it by reproachful
means. He never shows us a
smiling countenance while he meditates
evil against us in his heart, lie never,
praises us among our friends, and then
joins in traducing us among our enemies.]
We shall never find one part of his character
at variance with another. In his
manners he is simple and unaffected ; in
all his proceedings, open and consistent.
I envy no quality of the mind or intellect
in others ; not genius,' power, wit, or

Tho eventful crisis at urhich affairs have

to be considerably"affi&cted. . The ^repeated
stoppages of large and respectable firms
occasion considerable alarm, and as may *
naturally be supposed, prevent mercantile.-'
men entering into engagements, or'intresting
capital in any article of commerce.-? ' We
have therefore had a considerable
dearth jtif business in all our wholesale
departments, both consumers. an<T speculators

kei'at present, notwithstanding the low
prices to which' almost all articles have
declined, being in expectation that lower
rates will yet be established. Two of the .
largest and most respectable houses, in

The'hioney market has been considerably
tranquilizer! by the arrival of 500,0001.
of Unitpfl States Bank and other American
bonds. This paper is a novelty in
our market, has excited much attention, .
and has been the subject of much conversation.
The bonds are drawn at twelve
months (late, and are payable at London,
Amsterdam and Par if. The United States
Bank Bunds bear no interest?those of
other American banks bear interest at 6
per cent. These bunds have secured con?:.i

those of the United States Hank, which it
must be remembered bear no interest,
have been done, at 94 to 94 1-2'for the
l()()l. bond?-those of the hank's bearing
interest at (> per cent, have been done at
98. There have been conflicting opinions
in circulation as to the ul'.iu ate effect of
tlio introduction of such paper here; but
whatever difference of sentiment may obtain
on litis point, there-can be but one as
to the rfleet already produced by that in-.'
jtfoduclio'h. These bonds ha\'c tranquilizer!
the minds ?tf numbers, rftid have bait-*
isbed a considerable portion of that increased,
perplexity and alarm which previously
filled the money market'. JS'or is.
this surprising, when it is considered that
they will he if necessary to the extent of
10,000,000 of dollars. Nobody appears to
have the slightest, doubt of the solidity of
ilie United States llank ; indeed the commercial
and monetary character of the U.
States is one of solidity, as such it is generally
esteemed ; and in fact, this is the
principal feature of the United States in
every thing. That country is one of vasfr
capabilities and great promise, and every
year it is rapidly progressing in every thing
that must ultimately make it a great natidn.
It is the most formidable rival with
which the country has (o contend, and it
will require a constant and vigorous exercrcise
of all the immense resources and
.experience which the countrv 'possesses, to
proven! the "f Inilcd Slates from occupying
our position iti scale of'nations; We will
not speculate now upon the effects likely to
he produced in our monetary and mercantile
markets by these bank bonds, but we
will instance 'them as they are thrown out

Since tine arrival of these bonds at Liverpool
a marked improvement has taken
place in matters there?the accounts are
better from the.north although there have
been some heavy'failures?and cotton has
advanced in the Liverpool market in the
fare of very large imports. The advices
also from the .manufacturing Districts '
come'bcttcr, and the face of things has
evinced a change for the belter. There
has been ru>'perceptible difference in the
amount of-money in circulation here, and.
the discount houses have done noihibg

In the II ouse of Lords, on the 1st May
Lord John Itussel and other members of

on the part of the House of Commons
requested a conference with their loFdship6

On the motion of the Earl of Shaftsbury,
their lordships agreed to the cone
