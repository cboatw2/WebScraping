to manure; and to enable him to
make a tiial, he planted 10 acres less, that
is 140 acres. From these with the manure
he was able to make, he gathered
51 bales. A small gain, but it was a
gain. The next year he planted 130
acres, and manured a little more, with
still a small increase of crop. The past
season he planted only 120 acres, still
increasing the application of manure,

the season had been good, he would have

of land planted to enable him to manure.
His intention is, next year to plant only
100 acres, and he will doubtless increase
his crop in much greater proportion than
he lessens the land in cultivation. If he

he might derive from the increased quantity
of manure a profit that would compensate
him for the labor, whilst the additional
cattle would be clear gain.
EDITOR'S CORRESPONDENCE.
Columbia, Monday, Nov. 23, 1840.
De?.R SIB ;
The House of Representatives, met at
12 o'clock M., and proceeded to organize
itself, by calling F. W. Davie to the chair.
The members elect, from the several districts
of the State, appeared, were quail- j
fied, and took their seats; except those
froro Richland, as to wlioni some diffi- j
0 cnlty existed, arising from the return of
the managers, in which they stated, that
seventeen illegal votes had been given at
Columbia. It appeared also from that
return, that the Democratic candidates
had a majority of the votes at that poll.
The Chairman inquired of the House,
what course should be taken in relation to
the members from Richland, who appear-'
ed and claimed their seats. Mr. M vers j
moved, that they be allowed to take
them. This motion was seconded by
Mr. Rhctt, and opposed by Mr. Henry.
The discussion became warm and animated,
and was participated in by Messrs.
Perry, B. F. Hunt, Myers, Bellinger, and j
others. It was contended on the one
side, that the return of the managers was
at least prima facie evidence, upon which ;
the House might act in the first instance, j
and permit the Wnig members to 1m j
sworn?postponing its final decision, upon j
tiie questions involved in the case,
to the ccming in of the report of
Committe of Privileges and Elections, t<
whom the matter would necessarily !><
referred. On the other hand it was inFisted,
that the return of the managers
declared fraud upon its f ice, in that, il stated
there *e.eseventeen votes which had
been surreptitiously polled, and instead ol
its being prima facie evidence, that the
members claiming their seats had been
legally elected, it was precisely the reverse,
and amounted, in fact, to a direct
negative that the Whig members had
been elected. The discussion was suspended
by a motion to lay the matter upon
the table, and the House proceeded to
the election of its officers. D. L. Ward^
law was elected Speaker, without opposition.
T. W. Glover, was elected Cierk,
also, without opposition. The House
then went into an election for Door-keeper,
and adjourned at a late hour, to meet
ou the next day at 12 o'clock M. In the
Sonate, the officers of the last session,
were re-elected. The two Houses interchanged
messages, that they had organized,
and were ready to proceed to business.
A message was sent from the
Senate, to his Excellency, informing
him, that the Senate were ready to receive
any communication from him.?
His Excellency returned an answer to
that body, that he would send a communication
to them, on the next day at 12
o'clock. The Senate then adjourned.
Hnnsr np Reppp?e\tatives.
Tuesday Nov. 24, 1840.
The House met, pursuant to adjournment.
A considerable part of to-day,
was consumed in the election of some of
the inferior officers. The Richland election,
was again taken up, and on motion
of T. W. Davie, referred to the Committee
on privileges and elections. The
governor's message, was handed in by his
Secretary, at 12 o'clock, and has since
furnished the principal subject for fireside
conversation. I herewith send you
a copy of it, for publication. As far as
an opinion may now be formed, it has
been very well received, and may be set
down, as creditable to the officer from
whose pen it proceeded. The subjects
brought to the attention of the legislature,
are such a3are entitled to its gravest conBlfforatiAn

with proper regard to their great importance.
Some fault has been found with
W those of its passages, which relate to the
different parties now existing in the state
as discovering a bitterness of feeling,
some what incompatible with that degree
of refinement which we look for, in all
the public acts and expressions ofso high
an officer, especially, when directed towards
a class of the citizens of the state,
who are evidently in the minority, hut
- who claim, as well asothors, to be thinking
and'acting fgr the pubfid good. In
thetwo^nj'nfrhcsof the legislature, there
is scarcely a vestige ,of party rancour,
and the politics of the day, have not as
yet been suffered to detract from, or add
I to, the influence of any one of the mem-1
| hers. It is regretted, that whilst such
| perfeel harmony prevailed, there should
any thing have proceeded from the executive
department, which was in the last!
degree calculated to disturb it, by holding
up any portion of the members, as objects
of suspicion, and indulging in language
of vituperation, respecting the party
which they represented. The most of
the business hours, were consumed in
presenting and referring, the matters
brought before the House, to the proper
committees, and at about 3 o'clock, the
House adjourned.
Wednesday, Nov. 25.
The House met at 12 M. The Speaker
announced to the House, the appointment
of the various committees, a copy
of which shall be forwarded to you as
sopn as it can be obtained. Various presentments
were read, relating to the
retailingo.f spirituous liquors, which were
on motion of Mr. Rhctt, referred to a
( special committee, consisting of five.? j
i Some discussion took ptacc on a mouoii
made by Mr. Thompson, an amendment
offered to it, by Mr. jv.hett, which
proposed that the committee on privileges
and elections, should report upon the
Richland election by the earliest possible
day, so as to allow the successful parties
to take their scats before the close of the
present session. Messrs. Thompson,
Rhett, Davie, Colcock, Bellinger, Henry
and Perry participated in the discussion.
It was contended, that the effect of the
amendment was i<> restrict the committee
in the range of its investigations, whilst j
the circumstances of the cast; r??Qliircd, i
that the case should be fully investigated, J
without restriction as to time, or the pro- j
per powers to be granted to the committee.
The amendment was rejected, and j
so the committee were left without par-!
ticuiar instructions. It was observed, j
hv some of the parties engaged in the j
debate, that the committee would use
despatch, whether specially instructed to
do so, or not, and there were not wanting
many, to concur in this opinion. Indeed,
to a mere looker-on, it was dillicult to
perceive how the members could extract
materials from so unimportant a subject,
lo make interesting speeches upon; but
so it was, there were several made, and
the House had to listen to them, and he
interested if they could. The fact is,
.here is too '"much speaking done, to
no consistent with a due attention to
the despatch of business. Too much
consideration is given, in the commence|
mcnt of the session, to very small matters,
and time is consumed in debating about
them, so that at the close of the session,
when those of graver import are brought
jo fore the House, they have to be dealt
with in too summary a manner. We anticipate,
however, great pleasure from the
debates of this session, should an occasion
arise, which is worthy of the exertions
of the many distinguished members
of which the legislature is now composed.
It is sriid here, that for many years there
has not been so much talent in the House.
The Governor's message, being the special
order of the day, was taken up, and
referred, and the House then adjourned.
The committee on privileges and elections,
commenced their sessions, this
evening, and entered upon the examination
of the facts, connected with the
Richland election. Of this committee
Mr. Bellinger, is chairman; and it may
not be amiss as his name has been mentioned,
to say a word or two respecting !
that gentleman. He is a lawyer, of great
abilities and application, and one of the
most prominent members of the House.
To me, he appears to combine all those
qualities, which constitute a great and
good man. With that modesty, which is
generally inseperable from great merit,
ne has the firmness, which no opposition |
can overthrow, and the untiring industry, j
I which no difficulties can dishearten. To
such men as he, the state can with all
confidence, commit her most important
interests, as he appears to be actuated
by no motives, but those which are inspired
by an ever present sense of duty.
The resolution, under which the commit,
tee over which he presides are now acting,
imposes upon them a great deal of
labour, and they have entered upon the
discharge of their duties with much industry.
Messrs. Adams, Black, Tradwcll,
addressed the committee, as the re presentatives
of the Whig party, and the
Democratic party were represented, by
1** - i rr*i
Messrs. uregg anu Myers. i ne committee
advanced no further at their first
session, than to agree upon certain points
on which to hear the parties?first, as to
tho manner in which the illegal votes
should be deducted, whether from the
aggregate number of votes which the
candidates received, or from the number
of votes received by the candidates, at
the particular poll where the illegal votes
were given?secondly, whether any evidence
would be received for what candidates
illegal votes given, other than that
furnished by the return of the managers- ;
and thirdly, if so, what kiiulj whether
from the voters themselves offering to
testify for whom they voted, or from other
persons; some of the parties have been
heard upon these points, but the committee,
as yet, have not made a decision.? :
More of this, hereafter.
The State Agricultural Society, held '
its exhibition to day. Although it may |
be bad manners to say so, I could not j
help thinking that compared with the :
stock which Pee Pee could furnish, the !
latter would find nothing to be ashamed j
of. I am sure I have seen better horses,
? '
cows, and hogs upon our own Pee Dec,
than were exhibited .here, without intending
any disparagement to the stock,
which composed this exhibition. For
although they were much better than I
have myself, I a in sure some of my
neighbours could have carried away a
prize, if it had been convenient for them
to have entered the lists. A commendable
spirit seems to prevail here, and in this
! neighbourhood, to advance the agricultural
interests of tlie state, and it is most
probable, that something will be done by
the legislature, upon that subject. Something
has been said about procuring an
agricultural survey, at the public expense,
in order to develope, the resources of the
country, but I have my doubts, whether
every planter is not the best jndgc of
what his own lands require, in order to
improve their productive qualities. There
are very few persons, who cannot improve
their lands, if they had the means within
their reach, and the proper industry?'if
they have the means, they are very apt
to know it, without having a gentleman
' i
employed by the state to teJl them so; ana
if tiiev have not the means, or the industry,
it is questionable whether a salaried
officer can give the planters any assistance
in these matters. Hercules told
tfue wagoner to "put his oxen shoulder1 to
the ituecl," and it is not bad advice to any
one, who wishes to do well for himself, in
particular or for the agricultural interest,
in general. If any th;.ng is intended to
be done for agriculture, it would seem,
that it might be more benefitted, by a
different provision.
I send these remarks to you, and wiil
observe that I have no objections they
should be published, if in your judgment,
thby are worthy of it, and may be interesting
(o soj^C of your readers. At the
d
same time, ii is proper to be said, that if
such publication deludes other and
more interesting ma'!*.r from your columns,
the writer would e.vpcct, as a matter
of course, that you would nof Impose
the task upon yourself. In the in^arf-'
time, the writer will continue to make, a
few remarks upon the most interesting
events which may occur during the session,
and will transmit them to you, or
not, as you may indicate your pleasure
upon the subject.

The English Government steamer the
Cyclops arrived here this morning from
Seyde, which place she left on the 21st
ult. She has on board the Emir Bechir
with fifteen members of his family, and
115 persons of his suite, with whom he is
proceeding to England.
The Captain of the Cyclops confirms
the accounts of the rising throughout nearly
the whole mountain.
The news from Syria of the general
defection from Mehemet Ali, and the very
significant abandonment of his cause by
the Emir Bechir, removes the casus belli,
indicated by the Thiers ministry, to a
greater distance. I f the " chances of war"

in Syria, no case will arise in which
England, or the Powers in alliance with
her. could be iustified in attacking the
power of the Pacha in Egypt, where alone
the late or present rulers of France have
declared an interest in his cause.
London Nov. 4.?The news from Syria
which arrived yesterday by the tele
graphic despatch of the 31st of October
from Toulon is undoubtedly very important,
and, though it shows that the reports
previously received were somewhat premature,
it fully confirms the rumor of the
success of the Anglo-Turkish forces, the
extension of the insurrection throughout
the country of Mount Lebanou, and the
probable defeat ?f Ibrahim whenever he
! shall venture to meet the allied troops.?
The despatch from Malta of the 27th tilt.,
giving news direct from Seyde of the 21st,
confirms the intelligence from Alexandria
i of the 7th; and the presence of the Emir
! Bcchir on board the Cyclops is likewise
i mentioned. It is, however, not easy to
j comprehend for what reason or in what
capacity the Emir is said to be on his way
to England?whether as a hostage, a prisoner,
or a negotiator.
Electrical Telegraph.?Professor
Wheatstone, the inventor of the electrical
telegraph which is now at work on the
Great Western railway, is at present in
Brussels, where he has been trying the
new improvements he has introduced in
j his apparatus. Mr. Whcatscne has suc:
cecded in so simplifying his apparatus that
he lifts reduced the number of wires employed
to two. The great objection which
had been previously made to the telegraphs
was the difficulty of repairing the wires in
case any should be broken or damaged,
as it was supposed it would not be possible
to tell where the fracture was. This difficulty
has now been obviated by means of
a small carriage moved along the lino of
the telegraph. The place where the defect
lies is indicated by a magnetic needle,
; which changes its position the instant it
i arrives at the part where the connexion is
{ broken. Professor Wheatstone conceives
1 that it is possible to communicate with his
apparatus between Dover and Calais. He

The weight of the bales is heavier in several
States than last year, by 15 to 20
pounds per bale, on account of the hrgh

New York, November 24, 1840.
The Great Western with Bristol dates
of the 7th, and with later news from all
! parts of the Old World, except the East
: Indies, arrived this morning, bringing
highly interesting and most important
news. The allied Powers have captured
I Sidon, defeated IbrahimPaciia, laid siege
to St. Jean d'Acrc, and were carrying all
before them. The Syrians were all in
arms against Ibrahim, and the Turks were
hurrying on more forces from Constantinople.
This makes all French aid hopeless.
France, wc sec, is too late to do any
good now to the Paciia of Egypt, even if
she were disposed. We have, in addition
to this, a calm, conciliatory, and dignified
speech from the King of the French, in
which he manifests his determination to
preserve peace, and at the same time to
preserve order in Paris and in France. The
news, I may add, is so favorable to peace,
that it Seems now only possible to break it
i by a revolution in France, of which, not,
withstanding France is in a highly excited
