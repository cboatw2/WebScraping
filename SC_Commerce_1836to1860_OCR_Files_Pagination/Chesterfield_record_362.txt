One single extract from the work is t
Uiai we can now give our readers.
"^Considering Ids extraordinary fccondii
and adaptation to ah climates, the ease er
cheapness with which he is reared (liriviti
almost equally Well on animal and vegetub
food) andtheJacility with which he is coi
veyed from ona place to another it is indw
surprising that 50 little is known in this coui
try of hi* hi.story.nnJ mAiis. and such lis
attention paid to the improvement of so v
Iuublc an animal as the Domestic Hog. 'j
a great extent, among many of our farmei
has the hog been considered as a subordi
ate species of live stock?a mere consum
at the refuse of the kitchen, whose prcsen<
must be toleratedas a necessary evil. Tl
vast improvement to be effected by the in
portatiou of new garieticS, or judicious cro:
hcs among those easily procured, seems 1
have almost culpably escaped the attentic
of lhose with whom the improvement of a
other kinds of s'ock has been a subject <
intense and constant reflection. Nutur;
History abounds w^in smguwriy minute a<
tails of tiie habits of many rare, and in a
ngriculiur.il point of view, apparently usi
less animals. Volumes have been wriitt
on the breeds, the treatment and diseases
sheep. Treatise af er trea ise on catt
has been multiplied, exhibiting in ci< tail ti
change efTecied by judicious anJ continui
cross r.gs, to so great on extent that ll
distinguishing characteristics of the pare
stock are scarcely to be recognised in th(
descendan t while, with perhaps a solita]
exception,* little has been offer d to t!
public, calculated to furnish practical info
mathp in regard to swine, it is true th
now and then we find articles discussii
different poin's connected" with these ne
leend animals, scattered amid the pages
our valuable agricultural periodicals. It
ulso true, if enjoying free access to boo
and sufficient leisure, that we can, as t
result of prolonged investigations, gather
one time much of interest, regarding tl
origin and habits of swine as the subjec
of Na'ural History ; at another many fa
calculated to aid or govern our estimate
the comparative value of improved varieti*
and again, sound practical directions as
the best mode treatment to secure theutmr
limit of perfection. But the attainment
knowledge by a process involving such e
petiditurcs of time and research, is imp
uble to the many, and sufficiently irkson
to ino few whose situation authorizes ni
whoso wishes lead them to attempt
to cxcito a deep rogret that instead
scattered truths, and .disconnected fuel
though important in themselves, no piai
practical, and connected treatise on a sul
ject so important can be found.
Frequent importations and repeated cro
sings on them, have produced within tl
last few years numerous breeds of swine

-portant and most generally known are t
follows :?
J. The Berkshire hog.

hA?rr the cue given inCongross, a brother
of he candidate tor Governor ot Connecticut,
Mr. Richard Ndes, took up the argument.?
More wise or more wary than Mr. Buchanan,
he *pake, not to the laborer, but to a 'manu**
faoiurer.' Let us hear his own account of
the matter, and as he and his brother, the
candidate, consult much together, we doubtless
here have the views of both. Jn his published
siatf-men*, in the Hart lord Tunes, Mr.
Richard Nil' s;"
"One in an u fa rurer to whom I made this
start ment- asked what would be effect of the
sub-Treasury 1 I replied, that I thought it
might in somu degree check the excessive expansion
of the oanks, and give mnrt s*ability
to business, and that the price of labor would
probably be some reduced: but that produce
and the m cessarns of life would be reduced
in a much greater proportion, which would
make it much better for ;bc laboring man as
we J -*S I'T UJe iiirtuuirtci urer.
mH re Mr. Mtea evidently surpasses Mr.
Buchanan. Ho fo-pw-v that neither hia i
nor Mr. BuftKUMii's 4iove fr?c laboring
men' would jf deemed an adequate compensation
for reducing th ir their wages. He
therefore go:s a step further, and after tickling
the tmnufacJurer, tries to fickle the laborer
also. He admits that, by the sub Treasury,
'the Drice of inter wdi, probably, be some
reduced.' But he tells him it will be much
better for him. How better ? Because says
Mr. Niles, 'produce and the necessaries of life
will be reduced in a much greater proportion.'
Who toils to raise produce, and supply us with
the necessaries of life ? The farmer. Let
Mr. Niles go one step lurther, and tell the far'

Mr. Hand made a remark which the
Reporter could no' hear, hut the purport of
which may be inferred from Mr. Wise's
i ?t !
response, and then movea me proiuus
question.
Mr. Wise. Iam no alarmist. I have
no Idea that there is to be a war. But I
go tor the necessity of fortifications upon
die most liberal bcule tor a peace establish*
inent.
Mr. Adams appealed to Mr. Hand to
withdraw his motion for the previous question.
Whether Mr. H. did so or no', the Reporter
can iuipart no information be\ oud
the inference to be drawn from the statement
which follows.
Mr. Adams said Iip wished to say a word
on this suhj' Ci, because he found that there
w as among his own constituents, and among
that portion of the people ol this country
w! o were now, by the act of God, deprived
of the s. rv ices of their immedurt Rep rest* h

irot for years to come, and he hoped Miis
statement would be reported to his constituents,
and to those next to his own district?the
people of tie* city of Boston?w ho
were probably as deeply interested in the
preservation of peace with Great Britain as
any portion of the people of the United
States,
Mr. R >ett rose to inquire of the Spenker
whether the demand for the previous ques-tion
was or whs noi withdrawn ?
Mr. Hand was understood to say he had
not withdrawn it.
Mr. Adams regretted, he said, tl at the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rhett)
was unwilling to hear that there was no
danger of* war with Great Britain. The jk
previous question had been withdrawn, and,
be h ijiod he would not be again interrupled.

After some confusion, cries to orders &e.
Mr. A la ins proceeded to make some remarks,
of which the substance may be
found below.
fie stated for tho benefit of h's consutue,its
ami, of tire immediate neighborhood
of his constituents, and of tiie
People of the whole country, that he did
not apprehend, in the slightest degree,
that there was any immediate danger
of a war with Greut Britain, or forynrs to
come. And he founded this opinion on
two things : Jn the first place, he founded
douthe Message of the President of tho .
United S ates at the (^Hnmcncement of flic
pnsent session, in which he (Mr. A.)
(nought then; was not a single uord.of recommendation
to the People to pieparo
themselves for that great and terrible canflct
which must ensue whenever we came
in conflict with Great Britain. From the
day he saw that Message, ho concluded in
li s own mind that there wr?g no danger of a
war with Gr at Britato. And why ? Because
tie was sure that, tfUhe President of tho
| United Slates himself had the slightest apI
prHii ns on of Jang' r < f r-n immediate or
ar!y collision, it would have been wrong in
j trim not to have recoimiaiKied v? ry strong
and tXiensive preparations for that event.
I 1 hen, uKer tliat Message was delivered, he
i (if r. A ) saw weeks upon weeks pass away 4^
under an nppichcnsion on the part of th^
I 1-1 I7rn< ?r ll>,. S !i?pj nnil mnnv nf

the members of litis M iu.sc that there vv.is
dung* r of war ; when he saw the correspon
f?n?re which had taken place (and which
from time to time hud been communicated
10 Congress) between the Secreturv ofStato
and th" British Minister here?he confessmI
he had wailed to see on what ground it
was that the President of the United States
had concluded that there was not the slightest
danger of a collision with Great Britain
ut present.
W (ii h?: I.st ro,TfSpondeace was com11><11;i
. ted in die S?- <?! ?-and when a genreman
lie < ouinnun of the Cominiuee oir
Foreign Affairs in this House (Mr. Pier bus)
sounded alarm?an alarm which pervaded
the whoi-coun'ry?he (Mr. A.) felt a dego
e ol eonct rn and apprehension hinjclf,
no then hiving seen the correspondence.
But the very next morning li#saw it; and,
in the hist letter from the Secretury of State
o the British Minister, he saw fho"grounds
upon hich the President had come to such
a conclusion, and very sufely come to if.
That correspond- n? et us ail must huve obd,
find been of an irritating character.
There wa> anger, passion, feeling upon boih
sales; and the community and many mem- ~*
h-rs ol Congress, see ng these expressions
of irr ta'.ion, probably came to the conclusi
-n, unnecessarily as he thought, that there
was. danger of an immediate collision.
II?*, soon as he saw ihe last le ter of the
Secretary o' S a e, became satisfied that
th re was no sue:; danger ; for, in the very
beat and t< mpe>t of his f ission, the Secret
.ry of Slate broke ofT, and said, that from
the day on which the Pr? s dent of the United
S ate* i nti red upon the duties of his station,
lie had determined hat, in the event of the
two parties riot heirg aide to come to an un?
dersiaiidini; hy means of their negotiations,
he would propose a reference of the gn at
qu st'on at issue, for the second time, to a
ilurd partv. To this the very natural reply \.
of ?j British Miois.er was, that this was a
now proposition, which he could only communicate
in his Governm nt, as he would
immediately do. And that was the position

pan of tin; Gov< rument of tin United States
?and that, ol course, wouldnecessarly prevent

Biiiain must 'eterrnine whether it would

Now, he said tha' Ik Government of Great
Bi tain could not refuse this proposition ;
an-1 when the quest on was referred to a
third Power, we should have no war from
that! me forward until at any ra'e the arbitrators
had come ;o a decision,, which
would take years.
There was one other possibility which
rn'iiht induce collision; which was, that
while those n^go'tat'ons were go ng on, tho
Bii isli Government might continue to en*
