addre-ved the Seante for two hours in re

it, and particularly those of Mr. )IcDuflie
and Mr. Calhoun. He denied that the
teiritory in question was worthless. and
made statements to slow its value and
importance, and advantages in soil, cli
mate. fisheries, furs, and for commerce,
and as a6ordiog the only harbor and naval
station on our Northwestcoasi. and the only
inlet and thoroughfare to the iuterior. If
it was valucloss, there was no dan:er of
provoking war with England by medling
with it: and as to axpense, we could cer
tahdly afford 100,000 for this homet oibject,
if we could ford 600.000 fur ts squadron

This session of Congress is devoted to
flhe peculiar business of making or unma- I
king Presidents. In the Senate, all the
hubbub abont tle late Ilritish Treay, nod
the aggressions of Great Britain on tie I
Oregon rerritory. is deigned to affect this I
question. and to bear adversely upun the
position of your great Senator. So also
in the H1oue and Senate, iho fuss ab."j,

-ound to the benefit of tien. Jackson', two
friends. Mr. Van Puren and tiov. l',lk of

quer-. r. Clay iw a U. S. hIant-Ir.
Van Duren iir the Independent Treasury,
are strpposed to be travelling up in popular
favor by those rcsp-ctive measures. In
the mean time, however. the first choice of
many, and the second choice of all, for the
Presidency-Mr. Calhoun. seems to be
noiselessly pushing ahead. The convic.
tion seems to be deepening, that no other
man can reform the Government. The
principlo of restorationl on which Mr. V.
B's. friends put hisi prutensions, is fatal to
all rrform : for if he comes in on this
ground. he will be compelled, forthwith,
to replace every man whom the Whbigs
ejected from office. 1f he is raised up by
it,hbe must raise all others by it also whlo
fell with him, or he wilt betray the very
principle on which he is lifted in oflice.
Illis re-elemSiou on such principles, would
indeed be a maudate to him not to refornm,
and coupled with his excellent easy tem
per, nto one doubts- the mandate will be
f ulfiled. For the purposes of reform, an
other candidate therefore would be prefer
erahle. Such is the conversation I hear
sometimes in the lobbies of thte House.
