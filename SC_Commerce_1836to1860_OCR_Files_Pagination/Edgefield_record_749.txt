poses. for annoying England, in a Cnen
consideration of so much of the "estimato
of appropriation for 1843-'44," as relates
to the construction of a dyke for closing the
Hog Island Channel in Charleston harbor,
South Carolina, and that the subject be
referred to the committee on commerce.
Mr. Holmes moved to amend the reso
lation by striking out the words *-commit
tee on commerce," and inserting in lieu
thereof the words "committee on military
affeirs."
Ar. Holmes explaine.! that the appro
priation was not proposed nor asked for
improving the harbor of Charleston. All
that was asked that the Government should
take recourse for the protection of ibeir
own Fort in the harbour. The subject,
therefore, belonged not to the committee on
commerce, but to the committee on military
allairs. Mr. Fillmore said that the esti
mates sent t. the committee was for im
proving the harbor.
Mr. Granger said, if the object was to
raise anuy conscientious scruples about the
constitutionality of improving harbours.
lby making this appear to be ain appropria
tion for a military object, he hotld vote
against tle amendment of Mr. liolmes.
Mr. Holmes replied, that without any con
stience or pretence of conscience in the
matter, he cunsidcred the object as military.
But the amendment wus rejected and the
resolution adopted.

r- may be revnlutfonized by landing twenty
thousand picket troops on her shores.
0 This he said, in reply to Mr. Calhoun's
e suggestion, that in ca' w6 violated the
'e lteary, and gave England a pretext for
h war, she wouldexpel us from the Oregon
I territory, through her facilities of access
8 to ihe country by her nastal powers fromn
China, through her far-trading establish
wents, and the- influence those establish
t ments exert over the Indians. Mr. Cal
houn considered that, by making the issue
of the treaty. we would in efTeet, make a
tender of the treaty to Great Britain.
But, Mr. Benton says let as violate the
treaty and take possession without notice;
e let us go to war; and what then ? We
o can help frerand to gain her Independence.
Ielf thise the o-ject or provoking hostilities
with Great Britain. why not declare it
openly, and comnmeuro a war of fraterni
zation.
Mr. Benton predicted that England was
.soon to beinvo!-.ed in war. The natiotns
of the earth were to rise up against her or
ro;ance and o' ergrown power. The re
sult of it was tip be, though lie might tnot
live to see it, tle loss of her Hudson bay
territories and the Canadas, and the loss of
Ireland. This grand movement. it tap
