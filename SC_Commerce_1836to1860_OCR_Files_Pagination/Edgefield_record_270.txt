Extract from the Report of the Committee of ten.
After weighing all the statemtents & ar
guments, submitted to fle Committee.they
have come decidledhl to the opinion that
teign-goods-ty-b'e itmptortedl into, and
sold at the Southern ports as cheaply anud
'jipon as good terms, ats at ithe Norib; and
perhaps it is not goina too fair i0 say, tip ,n
better-an extensive inquiry amongt ihen
enables the Committee to say, that much is
the opinion generally entertuined by the
best informed merchants. Acting upin
'this opinion. duriong the Istt season, they
have made importations upon a scale grea
ter than has been done in twenty ve;rs,
and as the Copi-mittee are informed, at
rates That would allow their s:le upon
terms mwre favorable than the Nev. -Jork
market has afforded. Many itm-; arces
were laid before the Committee. illustra

not as conclusive prools that all the
trade has been of a similar character.
bit as giving some data. by which the
truth may be approximated. While it is
conceded that the business of a single sea
son, nor perhaps the cases cited are such
proofs of the stability of the trade or its
general character, as may be considered
conclusive, yet, when they come iii sup
port.of the general principles upon which
the Committee have based their options,
they cannot fail to have weight.
* One of the Committee. an experienced
merchant, living more than 100 miles i.:
the interior of South-Carolina, imported
direct, the present year's sales. fHe vinsi
ted New-York afterwards, and examined
the stocks and market car, fully-he states.
that thesame kind of goods w ere as high
or higher, than his would cost him, all ex
penses included, at his own store. One
articleespecially was areaty more so. to
wiit, negro blankts,-his, standing him at
his store, in $25 the piece. while for the
same quality they demauded $33 m N-w% -
York, a price lie could have s9hl for at
home: and realizcd 32 per cet. profit.
A firm in ihe city of Charlc-ston, lately
imported a lrge supplv( of goods direct,
and about thecmme time had an ord-'r i -
led for similar good in New-York, which,
1try state to the Comutitteeeost them full
15 per cent. higher than those imported
direct. Amongst them was a case olensi
meres, a match case to one imported, the
same in every respect, ani cotinC tcar3i0
per cent. hizhcr than the imported case.
Another firm of this city. largely enga
ged in the wholesale tradle, has a partner
residing in New-York, by whomn about
one-third of their stock is purchased there,
the balance hitg importel direct. Thev
inform the Committee. that the r-oods pur
chnsedh in New York, hiave cost them fromi
15 to 20 per cent. highet Itan simiair goods
imported direct.
In regard to the nsr:-mrents of good
now in the Sutihern ,ea-ports, the Com
mittec are uninforied., except s:i tonCh irles
Ton-in which city the supply h!!s been grea
ier tian any which had been for :30 years
past. containing excellent assotrtnents of
fbreign goods. Of doinestis-the assor
mients. thotuh better tbin hcretofore, have
not, it is tunder;:ood. been either as varied
or good as at the North. The great tmar
ket of New-York mtst a!lhrd more range
of selcetion at all times, bt.t it may be
questioned whether it affurds a much grea
ter variety of oods suiitc: to the the South
er nimarket, ort of b-tter staple. M:ost of
the importing house-s, during the past
snummecr, had patnters in Europe. who
we-re well acqutaintedl with the wants atnd
tastes of the Sotthern people. atnd manef
their seleetions to suit-and, tnotwithm and
ing the tratdo of the city has beeni far grena
ter- than wats aniticipated, they have still
managetd to keep their stocks at a respec
table rate, and~ are tnow understood to have
vecry good assortmentts. A strong proof,
not only that the assortiments have suited
-the detland'ttt tha.-t the rates have been bet
-ter titan could be obtained at the North,
exists in the increased hunsinesst tho sales
of this season. notwithistanding; the epidem
ic of thte last sttmmer, are computed at 25
per cent, advance on those oaf the years
preceding. Many intelligent antd enter
prisitng dealers from the interior towns, vil
lages andl country, who formerly traded to
New-York, with a foil knowledge of all
the facets tnecesssary to proper conclusions,
have discontined trading with New-.York,
and maide their purchases here-and oth
ers, after per-sisting in going there, and
purchasitng, have tetturned here, examined
the stocks, and regr-etted they had lost
time and money by giting. Whilst grea
ter activity lhas pervaded this market, a
complarativ-e stagnation has falletn upon
that part of New Y -rk which has hereto
fore participated latrgely in our trade One
firm. which has a house bot h in Charles
ton and New-York, sol, on the capital
employed the past year, full 75 psr cent.
more good' in the rormner than in the lat ter
city. These are gratifying evidences that
our trade is falling back itito its ancien:
chantiels, and agaiti returning to fertilize
un0d re-people its ancient home.
*The last hiranchi of the resolution directs
the Cotmmittee to inquire if any anid what
.ndvanttages exist in making purchases
ft-rm the direct importer at the Sonth.
Many have been g'ninted out in the ptree
ding- pages of thbis repor-others have
been more ably and empihntically explain
* ed in the report submitted by the Commit
tee of Twenty-one. There are some ~of
those wvhic~h may be adverted to presently
--for~ the moment, however, others tnt
yet mentioned will be remarked tupon.
. It is certainly good policy itn the retail
merchant to concentrate his dealings. if he
can, at the satne nmarket, provided his
supplies can lbe got there on s goodl ter-i'.
It has already becen shown, that in Charles
ton the assortments are good, 'the supply
ample, the terms fair. and the credits fa
vorabid~. There are parts of the ret ailer's
supplies which he cani get no where so
well as at the Southern seaports-West
India gi-oeeries for- instance. By purtcha
sing the other goods tnecesary for his hbusi
ness at thte same market, he simplifies his
business, comrttlts it to a single point
nearer to him, ahd wihere he cant avail him
self of more meants to meet his payments
all kindes ofecontry produce ma.1y he taken
hy him from his cme a nnd madeas
mrailable at the spot where he owes his
leit, as money itself.
Another advautage results from it. His
rustomers will buy more freely when his
zootls are fresh. That merchant does the
Jest business whose goods iest suit the
a ants and tastes of his customers, he
iced buy no mote at a time thau will meet
ready sale-for. being near his market, he
enn in a very short tinw get more goods
ut a giveta kind if'neetted-he thus makes
a stmaller capital do a large business, and
runs little risk of iustaining losses by goods
growing old on his hands, and going out of
fazshioni.
The Committee of Twenty-one, have
urged with great force a view in relation
to this braitch of the subject, which catn
not tbe too leighly estimated, to wit;-the
iecnmulatious which result to the capital
of the country, by ki-eping its own trade
aoc he profirs oi it it hme,' increasing
the meanis of the impoi ter for enlarging his
importations, and exteudiig hiscredits and
::comm1 totdat ions. The official reports froi
the Treasury give us sonie data on which
to ha.e a calculatio , which may not be
withour is use. in 1834, '5, '6 '7, '8, five
years, the exports to foreign countries, of
iltimestie produce, from Charleston. was
by Custom House valuation, 858,000,000,
lhroning off fractions. To this must be
odded for what was sent coastwise, per
haps 25 per cent. or$14,500;000, making
in all of domesticf produce,8753,500,000. or
anl average of $14,5U0,000, by Custom
ilonse valtia'ion. If the moderate rate
of 10 per cent. he added, us their value in
foreigti or Northern tmarkets where they
are sold, it will miake an average annual
amount of near S16.000,000, n hich should
have returned to Charleston, in the shape
afgiiods and other supplies for the con
%umuiption of the conntry which furnished
the exports. If from this amount two i a bs

Late and Important from Merico.-The
United Stales shiop of war Warren. touch
ed at the Dlahze on the night of the 14th
inst. for the purpose of landing passengers
and freight. .destined for this port from
Tampico. By this conveyance have been
received the particulars of the surrender
of Tampico to the Government forces un
der General Arista. The Federalists had
a strong force in the town at the time,
which was well fortified and strong hopes
were entertained that the garrison would
stand a siege. We have seen a private
letter, which states that the soldiers were
%ery inttch dissntisfied with the articles of
capitulation. After the treaty had been
signerl by the officers, they remained un
der aratts twenty four hours, refusing to
accede to the convention-threatening
leath to the Centralists if they dared to
enter the city, and menacing vengeance
upon the offieers and citizens, for having
betraved them into the hands of the ene
my. ' For a while fears were felt lest the
city would be given up to pillage by the
exasperated soldiery. But by some means
or other, they were at length pacified, and
the capitulation of the place was quietly
conducted. No violence was olfered by
General Arista or the Central troops to
the inhabitanits-private property was re
spected antd the utmost good order and
tranquility prevailed. The terms of the
treaty were certainly very advantageous
to the Federalists. All political otfences
were to he pardoned, and the officers and
soldiers who choose, were permitted to re
tain their rank in the army. Even the
arch rebel, Urren, was included in the an
nesty, provided lie determined to accept of
the terms. At the time of the occurrence
he was absent from Tampico.
In consequence of the aniralC arrange
ments between the belligerent parties, for
ei-ners resident at Tanpico expericed
no molestation. Evrry thing remained
quiet, antd business and commerce will
now he resumed, and flow on in their ac
customed channel. Many surmaiqes and
rumors were afloat with r.:sppct to the
tacans by which the government obtained
this bloodless victory. Some of the zeal
ous Federalists intimate that the Feder
alist officers suffered thetuselves to be
tampered with in the absence of Urrea.
llowever this may be, it is quite certain
that the capitulation, of Tanipico has put
an end for the present to the cause of Fed
eralism.
The necounts from the interior were con
tradictory. It seems to be, though, the
general impression, that the government
had triumphed at every point. A rumor
of the capture of Tuspan was current at
the time the Warren sailed. The capitu
lation of Tampico took place on the 9th
inst ; Bustatnente was to make hi4 public
entry into the city. It is gratifying to
learn that the lives and property of foreign
residents were so well respected. High
compliments are paid to Capt, W. A.
Spencer, of the Warren, for his exertions
and t srong interposition in behalf of Armer
iran citizens. by which ithey were secured
froim all harm either to their persons or ef
fects.-Bulletin.

n h was itn cotmimandi of the Federalists
unti the 1st inst. when he treacherously
abatndoned them by flight His poltroonery
dis:ueted and dzspirited the officers and
others, who were tunited with him in the
defence of the city. The soldiers, we
learn, were to the la'st more disposed to
resist lbhan capitulate; they freely express
ed their disapprobauion of that disgrace,
ful measure, but were compelled to acquti.
.'sce in the terms agreedl upon by their of
fic'ers. We are infortmed by unquestiona -
ble athority, that the federal force previ
ins to the capitulation, was equal to otie
thousand men under artms; whereas that
of Gent. Arista did tnt certainly exceed 400
eil'ective men. General Btustamenite wvas
-aid to be at some leagtues distatnce from
TPampico, and was expected at that town
in two or three days to assume the com
ma ;nd.
A correspondent informs us that there
was much appr--hension manifested by the
f 'reign merchants in Tampico. as to the
course that would be pursted in reference
to the dluties on the prohibited goods that
htad arrived since the commencement of
die revolttion on the firat oif October last.
Ge'neral Arista, in his proclamnation, de
elares "that the government of Mexico
will decido the question whether the du
ties were paid in good faith to the revolu
riotnary authorities." Fears are entertain
ed that repaytnent of 8uch duties will he
required. There appears to be no doubt
that the revolution is, for some time at least
suppjressed, miore pariicularly upon the sea
coast which remained in their possession,
and that as the only man of acknowledged
firmness and integeity, influence and un
daunted bravery, has been sacrificed totbe
vindictive fury of Santa Ana, their hopes
of ascendancy must he regarded as utterly
despierate. Nothing but one of those sud
den shiftings of political sentiment so com
tnon to tne capricious and ignorant popu
lace of Mexico, can offer the slightest
chan'ce for a revival of their cause.

soon after was dliscovered to be aground.
She made the signal of a tunion down, and
ired, eernl umis. when the seamenrs (a
umbia, Emblem and Rufus Putnam went
tnt to her assistance. The fury of the
.aves, however, rendered it too perilous
'or boats of light draught to run along side
)f her; and her position was inuccessable
to the Columbia, which, however, came
to anchor, and sent her boat for the Cuba's
passengers. The Putnam and Emblem
returned into port last evening, unable to
render any assistance to the sulferers.
The Colutnbia came in this morning with
the Cuba's passengers. most of whom were
without their baggage, owing to the al
most impossibility of taking it into the
small boats in so heavy a sea. About
one hundred pilssengers were on board,
but the pasenger list is lost.
The boat it is said,will be a total wreck;
but the cargo, which is reported to be of
great value, may possibly be saved for the
most part, though considerably damaged.
Nearly every suitable hoat has beei put in
requisition. and a lare numler of our citi

daunted, however, thev fearlessly charge'
upon the enemy. and in a few minute
completely routed them, and gained pos
ses-ion of the ground which they had oc
cupied. The Indians, soon afier, rallie<
again, and made repeated attacks upot
them-but in vain. They were repeated
ly repulsed with great loss. This heroi
band sustained their ground for more that
two hours against four times their num
ber of the enemy. Towards sunset, th
Indian chief, apparently enraged to b
thus held at bay by a force so greatly in
ferior to his own, collected all his warrior
and made one deperate charge; but whet
he had arrived within about thirty steps
at the head of his men, and the renaindei
of the enemy seeing hin fall, raised a hi
dious yell and fled, leaving him and for:
of the' companions dead upon the field.'

Government cannot he mistaken. In fac
the French have many of the first princi

mere names signifying nothing, and no

property, they vote by ballot, and an equa

is to,) much restricted by the extent of thu
qualifcation reqtuired, but time will snot
bring the remedy for this. and there is tot
great a tendency to centralization in theil
system. Paris is the centre of politica
life, not merely for those objects whicl
agreeably to our notions, are perfectli
connected with the Governmett, bu
fr almost every thing which interest:
the community. And here yon see thu
true key to the iifnuce which Paris hai
exercised upon the French nation in al
the revolutions fromt i789 to this day; no
one has originated out of Pat is, and no
one has been unsucissful in the kingdotn
