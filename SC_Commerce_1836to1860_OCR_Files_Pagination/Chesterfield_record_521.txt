part a very disagreeable flavor to both
milk and butter. Every farmer, however,!
should have a cella^ under or contiguous |
to his barn that would contain a sufficient
quantity to feed during the winter, or a
greater portion of it. As the roots are
disposed of, a word in regard to the tops:
they sliouid be gathered and laid (not too
thick) in some cool place ; those from
beets should be fed to milch cows?from
ruta baga to young stock, or cows not in
rsilk, as they give to the butter an unpleasant
flavor.
Every fanner who cultivates the man.
?el wurtzel or 9ugar beet should raise his
own 9eed ; as it not unfrequently happens
that three-fourths of the seed will not
vegetate?a serious loss and disappointment
after being at the expense and trouble
of preparing the land. The cause of
this failure is generally attributed to old
seed. I was also under this impression
until I attempted to raise my own seed,
when I discovered the true cause. The
feed plants throw out a number of long
and tender stems or stalks, which soon
become heavily loaded with seed, and unteas
supported in some wav, the most
valuable stalks are broken off by the first
storm of rain or wind they encounter.
The seed from these stalks are aH gather. I
ed by the seedsman and sold with the
good seed, as they scarcely differ in external
appearance from those that have
been perfected. Where the plants are
set in rows, a few sticks with forked ends,
set in the ground, on each side the row,
with poles laid in the fork at a proper
height, furnish a cheap and sufficient support.
Single roots may be supported by1
two or more small cords tied around the |
stems at different heights. Of good seed, j
one pound of rutabaga- and two ponnds ;
of be are amply t sufficient for one acre. J"
My experience in the cultivation of the j
carrot has been very limited. Finding j
them to require so much more hand labor
than the beet or turnip with greater expense
in gathering, while they were far
inferior in point of productiveness, I was
under the impression that their superiori.

Lor and expense. My apparatus being
small (having been erected for preparing
food for a small number of swine.) and
not convenient to my-barn, I found it at- (
tended with much labor-?and as this cannot
be done under the e\e of the farmer, I
who, like myself superintends and aids in
executing^ the other labors of-the farm
much time is generally wasted by the |
hand employed in preparing the food and i
distributing .it among the stock. The !
plan of feeding which I have adopted is 1
as follows: Near the cellar which contains
the roots is placed an ohlongbox,
made of plank, say three feet hy six, into 1
which the roots are thrown; a common 1
garden spade ground sharp is used to cut
them; baskets with a hoop handle that '
wilV each hold a feed for one animal are ;
provided; with these, the prepared roots 1
are carried by a boy into the alley in I
front of the stalks in which the animals <
are confined, and deposited in a tight i
manger, (the first stall in the range being only
twenty feet from the cellar.) In
this way two boys, one to cut and the
other to carry the roots, will feed a large
stock in a very short time, and under the
eve of the master while he is employed in
attending to the other stock about the
stables and yard. A small quantity of
.salt is given with the roots once a day.
I have for some time entertained the
opinion that the best plan of feeding
roots is to grate them fine and mix them
with cut hay or straw ; and this opinion
been confirmed by an experiment
made during the past winter: Pounding
the beets to a jellv and mixing with them
an ecptttt quantity of cut straw moistened
with water, the whole mess was eaten
greedily, and in two weeks the animal
had evidently improved in appearanceluting
tbe name quantity of roots she had
before, ft is very certain, the more
coarse provender cattle can be induced to
eat with their richer or more nourishing
food, the better will he their condition.
?Thus, in wintering store cattle, after
they have had ttieir feed of stalks or hay
in the morning, a rack is tilled with straw
to which they have access through the
?ity, by which (experience has proved)
they are much benefitted. I contemplate
procuring for use next winter a grate
mill, (similar to those used for apples) to
attach to the horse power connected with
my threshing machine, by which a sufficient
quantity for a large stock may be
prepared in a short t.me as they will grate

hour: expense exclusive of horse power
f*om $15 to 20. Swine eat the sugar
beet greedily?they eat them in preference
to the turnip ; but when the beet is
fed in any quantity they should be cooked,
as they invariably produce scouring or
looseness of the bowels when fed in a raw
ftate; when cocked and fed with a small
quantity of bran, hogs thrive and fatten
rapidly upon them.?Horses also prefer
the beet to the turnip, and when worked
hard and grained, one feed of beets per
day i* of great service, as thev are cooling
and opening to the system, and keep
the animal in a healthy and vigorous condition.
Although for horses [ prefer the
jfiner varieties of potatoes to any other
foot, the comparative cheapness of the
.beet uowever must induce us to give them
ihe preference on the score of economy.
"T^ere exists much difference of opinion
"in ncgaid to ihe/elative value of thf diff.
erent roots, and I have long been anxious
to make seme experiments that would
settle this matter satisfactorily; as most
of the opinions thai I have seen or heard,
either verbal or written, have been mere
guess work. With this view of la9t fall
procured in New York a lacmmoter (a
glass instrument ten inches long and
three-fourths of an inch in diameter,
worked off into tenths and hundredths)
for the purpose of testing the richness of
milk.?With this instrument I have tried
the milk of all iny cows, and to my great
surprise find they give from nine up to
twenty-five per cent, of cream?varying
sixteen per cent. Only one gives twenty-five
per cent., and she, one of the best
milkers in the yard, in three successive
trials made with her milk, gave the same
result?uo other cow giving over sixteen
per cent.
On the first of January last I commenced
measuring the milk of a cow from
which the calf had been sold one week
previous; she had been fed on turnip>|[ruta
bagafrom before calving up till this, time,
for fnnr weeks Drevious. one bushel per
day.?Her milk was carefully measured
for six successive days average, ten
quarts one gill per clay*; lactometer
filled three timesduring the wfpi-,, gave
each time fifteen per cent, cream. Feed
changed to sugar bee;?one bushel pnr
day for one week; commencement of
second week, measured?continued for
six days (same feed)?average quantity
per day, eight quarts and half pint; lactometer
field three times, each time, giving
eleven and a half per ct. of cream.
This experiment thus far was decidedly
in favor of the ruta baga, and the appearance
of the animal at the close of the
beet feeding was not as good as while fed
pp the'turnip. . lagain changed the feed
to turnip, intending to feed one week,
and again measure, hut a severe and protf^fH
illness in my family prevented
any farther experiments at this time.
On the 19th of March, I commenced
measuring the milk of another cow from
wnich the calf had been taken a few
days previous. Her feed for some t'mc
had been one bushels of beets per day,
and continued for one week, during
which the milk was measured?average
per day eleven quarts and one hall
pint; milk tried threee times, gave eleven
and a half per cent, of cream. Feed
changed to turnips; one bushel per day
for one week, then commenced meaaur.
?g?continued six days?average per
toy ten quarts one gill; milk tried as before,
gave nine per cent, of cream. Chanfed
to sugar beet?one bushel per day
for one week ; second week commenced
measuring?continued six days?average

giving ten per cent cream. In this exjeriment
there is a gradual falling off in
quantity in each of the changes of feed

heir having been severely frozen in the
all, as a part of my turnips were frozen
n the ground, but the ground thawing in
i few days they were taken up and dun.
>d. Although these experiments are very
hr from being conclusive, lam rather in.
dined to give the preference to the turnp.
I intend, however, to continue them
jntil I am entirely satisfied?intending
ilso to try the different grains (ground)?
feeding in the proportion of the average
produce of each per acre. I shall also
procure a thermometer to be used in future.
I find these experiments cannot be
conducted with perfect accuracy without
one, as the quantity of cream depends
very much upon the temperature. I
filled the lactometer in the winter and hung
it in a situation where I should suppose it
must have heen near the freezing point,
and in five hours a perfect separation had
taken place?all the cream being upon
the surface (none rising after)?the instrument
being as before stated ten inches
in length. It was filled again with milk
from the cow, and hung in the dwelling
room over a stove where the temperature
wa? about summer heat, and in fifteen
hours no separation had taken place?not
a particle of cream appearing upon the
surface. This will suggest to those hav.
ing the management of dairies, the grea!
advantage of wetting their pans for a feu
hours in cold water. I arn w?:i! sntisfiec
that in nine dairies out often, the milk ir

The lactometer and a common tumbler
three inches deep and three in d?arn t-i
at top, were 6Med with milk from tb?.

in one as in the other.?This explodes the
old and firmly established opinion of the
necessity of shallow pans. I have beer

Thus and to this oxtqnt, within4hs

They were made to absorb the sarpjef in

quate resources . except the authority ?
granted by law to augment the debt. * *
As yet no provission has been made to re- "
ducedthis debt or to checkits constant and
rapid increase. W$. find it, therefore, as ,
far as past legeslation and financial arrangements
characterized it a permanent and
increasing national debt. The tempore

Without unreasonably burdening comme

But as it may not comport with the views f
oPCongress to go into a re visionand adjustment
of the customs so long before the act
of March 2, 1833, comes to have its final J
and permanent operation, the undersigned
would respectfully recommend as a tern- j
porary measure, the levy of a duty of. 20
per cent. Advalorom on all articles 1
which are now free of duty, or which pay I
a less duty than 20 per cent, except gold 1
and silver, and the articles specific ally, en- .
umerated in ihe fith section of the act of '
March 2d, 1833. . "' * ^ -1
If this measure be adopted, it* is esti- 1
mated that there will be received iqto the (
Treasury from customs in the last quarter |1
of the present year, about #5,300.(100; in J
all of the year 1842, about #22^500,OflQj

It is believe that, after the heavy ex- t
penditures required for the public sefyice c
in the present year shall have been provi- (
ded for, the revenues which will ^accrue

to reconcile, as fqr as possible, the confiic- J

interests of the whole People of these tThi- t

that adjusment, not only to reciprocate t

eral spirit, the concession which niajr he s
accorded to our own commerce by foreign |
nations, but also to do justice to our own 2
citizens by meeting in a like equaf spirit 1

foreign nations may think fit to impose <

of January 21st, 1829, and May 19,1830 I

Of the. Public Debt.
But it is not expected that any tnodifir
otion of the revenue laws will he opera
?'ive fo supply the immediate wantsofthe
t Treasury, and to pay the debt which fall
. due in the present and in the ensneing
? year. A further loan is necessary to
; effect these ebjects, and the only question
? that can arise are as to the mode of proj
curing the loan, the character of the secu.
rities, and the assumed duration of the
. debt.
It would, in the opinion of the under?
signed, be unwise to charge upon the
t commerce or the resources of the country,
i in any form, the burden of paying at
once, or at all hastily, the national debt.
' Before that is done, measures of restora.
tion and relief are restored, and com

pres-sioa, sod a benign and liberal policy
on the part nf the General Government
should call forth once more the hardy ins

r and the vast resources of our country.
If we assume the period of from five to
eight years as that in wfcich this deht can

In the inception and durih^fhe progresve

elusive, have yet their advantages.?

ctual wants of the treasury re uire, and
le power to issue any giv- n sum is, for
ffective purposes of immediote expendiires,
a fund in the treasury available to

aired its maximum and ceases to ac*

je amount necessary to keep on hand to

aese advantages disappear. This mode

Jn Keeping and disbursing the publi
Moneys.
The undersigned would also respectful
y invite the attention of Congress to th
iresent mode of keeping and disbursini
he public motleys; and also to the sub
ect of the creation or employment of i
iscal agent to be changed with the pei
oupance of these and other duties. Th
lubject is one of great'i'mportasice, both t
Jie Government and to the community
Such agent or depository ought to unite
n the highest practicable degree, th
(afety of the public funds, and conven
jnce and economy in their administrs
ion ; and it should, if possible, he so se
ected or framed as to exert a salutary ir
luence over the business and currency c
;he country.
The mode of keeping and disbursin
he public money, provided by the act <
ruly 4,1840, will be found, on compar
ion with that heretofore chiefly used h
he Government, eminently deficient i
ill these essential requisites. ' The fit

ss abundant proof that the public rnnne
is unsafe in the custody of individual
ind that their official bonds are no auff
sient security for its safe-keeping an
faithful application. Within the perir
ibovo named many receiving officers coi
necfed with the Treasury Departmei
have become defaulters to the Goven
ment. The aggregate loss from th;
cause within that period, as shown by tt
books of the Department, amounts tof:
320.500, but a small part of which wi
probably be recovered from their bond
It is true that, in any system which ca
he adopted, tome part of the public monc
must, in the process of collection, pa
through the hands of individuals, and I
subject to tHeir defalcations; hut the a
of July 4,1840, extends and continues tl
risk beyond the period of collection, ar
it subjects large masses, which in tl
fluctuations of commerce, sometimes a
cumulate, to the same dangerous custod;
. Not only is the public money in t!
hands of individual more exposed to Io
from ordinary defalcations than when d
posited in a well-regulated bank ; but tl
Government is also liable to the risks <
tire, robbery, and other casualities, occu
ring either in deposite or transmissio
from which it is entirely protected wh<
a well-regulated hank is the depositoi
and the fiscal agent.
The present system is also, in mar
respects, cumbrous and inconvenien
Its tendency is to centre the disbursemen
of the public money at some of the Ea
tern cities, chiefly at New York. . Th
being the great commercial emporium
the.United States, is the point at whit
funds are the most valuable, and ther
fore, the most sought; hence those wl
are entitled to payments out of the publ
Treasury claim them there. It is tn
there is.agenefal discretion in the head
the Department to refuse or grant the f
citnh navmpnfq nrrnrrtincr fn its CO

venience ; but when the currency is d
ranged, and the premium on exchanges
high, this discretion involves discrimin
tion to a large amount' as tocreditors eqiii
ly entitled. It then becomes a dangerc
discretion, and one that ought jiot to e
its. But, under the present system,
cannot be avoided, save in a few case
without discharging every public liahili
at the most favored point.. This would
once centre all the disbursements at a fe
of the Eastern cities, and involve the
Treasury in the risk and expense of transporting
the public funds from the various
points of collection to the places of disburse
co^nt*
An item of less importance, but still
worthy of consideration, in settling on a
permanent and economical arrangement,
is the direct expense of the present system,
inclu ling the cost of the buildings
i for the deposite of the public money, and
the salaries of the officers and their clerks
who receive and disburse it. No portion
i of this risk, inconvenience, or expense
, j need to be incurred where a well-regulated
bank is made the fiscal agent.
But the present system is also, in the
t opinion of the undersigned, injurious to |
- the business and currency of the country. |
t Instead of permitting the credit and the
finances of the Government to lend their
r indirect but efficient aid in sustaining the
i credit and regulating the currency of the
r country, it brings into direct hostility
; those important interests. In the progress
of the system a sufficient amount of
? gold and silver to supply the wants of the
? Treasury must be withdrawn from circu\
lation and locked up in vaults, leaving nor
representative to supply its place in the
. general circulation.
f A large amount, also, in the hands of
? those who pay to or receive from the Tre3
asury, is equally withdrawn from general
i circulation, and made to flow through
3 those channels alone which lead into and
out of the public coffers. The other av.
enues of commerce and intercourse are
t thus deprived of their proportion 01 me
r precious metals.
Within the fifty.two years during
which our constitutional Government has
g existed, we have had, for two periods of
, twenty years each, a bank chartered by
y Congress as a depository of the public
e moneys and as a fiscal agent. We have
j had, also, at two intervals, amounting to
e about nfhe years, State banks employed
t for like purposes ; and, during the remain.
I der of the time, the funds of the Govern,
j ment have been kept and the finances ad.
i. ministered partly by banks and partly by
0 individual officers and agents. The losv
ses sustained by State banks, as depositog
ries, during the first period of their em?
ploymcnt, extending from 1811 to 1816,
|. agreeably to a statement prepared by the
t Secretary of the Treasury iq 1833, and
revised and republished in 1837, were
$1,O'K),076. In the latter period, from
e 1833 to 1837, though no actual loss is believed
to have occured, yet the Treasury
c and the country suffered inconvenience
and embarrassment from the fiscal nr.
1 rangements with those numerous and disI*
C*
c connected instittutions. But, during the
g forty years that the two banks of the Uni,
ted States were the depositories of the
a public money and the fiscal agents of the
- Government, no loss whatever was sus.
e tained, nor any delay or any expense in?
curred in transmitting or disbursing the
' public money, so far as the agency of
those institutions extended. Then, as
,e regards the wants of the Treasury merely,
l" rhesafety of the public funds, and econo.
my in their administration, experience
has demonstrated the superior utility of a
p hank constituted and adopted by Congre?
as a fiscal agent. It has also proved tc
<r us that the business of the country, it*
)f currency, its credit, its industry, and it*
i. commerce, are intimately connected with
v and dependent upon the financial arrange,
n. mentsofthe General Government. II

j Since the removal of the public depos.
^ ites from the Bank of the United States
in 1833, the Government has had no permanent
fiscal agent and no definite fin.
ancial system. All has been experiment
transfpr, and change. The business ol
ie the country has yielded to the unstead)
2- impulse, and moved forward with wilt
ill irregularity ; at one time stimula ed t<
* excessive action, at another sunk int<
in lethargy. And, in providing for the
y wants of the Treasury, it is surely im
88 portant to look, also, to the want* and th<
)e welfare of the community, from the pro
ducts of whoso industry the Treasury i
j supplied.
ie And as regards those great interests
c. we find the testimony of past years is n<
jr. less distinct and strong in favor of a mon

s* Government, and possessed of its confi

-h lished by the General Government, an
e charged with the equalization of exchan
ges, and the regulation of the currency.
,c In the present condition of ourcountr
the relief to be anticipated from such a
.? institution cannot he immediate, bi
'A*
must be the work of time. The businei
n of the country would, however, in th
|s opinion of the undersigned, steadily an
a> certainly revive under its influence,
ij. In whatever point of light the unde
us signed is able to view this subject, he
X' irresistibly led to the conclusion that sue
it a fiscal agent, so framed as to posse
>?*, those important functions, is alike essei
ty tial to the wants of the Treasury and
nt the community. Such ' an ' institutic
tw should be framed with deliberation, for
mm?*???
. .
must have high duties to perform, and ex* *
tensive interests to protect and promote |
and it should be granted with care, for it '
will be liable to great and dangerous
abuses* As the fiscal agent of the Gov*
ernment, and an effective regulator of the
currency in a wide-spread community, it
should be steady and uniform in its a4?
tion, and fixed and stable in its character.
_ .
The undersigned has no doubt of the
power of Congress to create such an institution.
Experience has proved its
necessity to carry cut other expressly
i granted powers; it has been exercised
! and recognized by the Legislative nod
| Executive departments of the Govern*
ment during four-fifths of the whole ptfi*
od of our national existence, and it has
received the uniform sanction of our high*
est judicial tribunal.
Yet that power has been questioned by
many wise and patriotic statesmen whose
opinions are entitled to consideration and
respect; and in a measure like this ofhi *b political
import, which, if wisely conceie* - . ,*
ed and cordially concurred in, must htvw''
a _-j i?An Iki
a great ana euuunug iuuwhv*
prosperity of the country, it is important
as far as possible, to obviate objections *
and reconcile opinions. ' " '
If such an institution can be so eon.
ceived in principle and guarded in its details
as to remove all scruples touching
the question of constitutional power, and . . ,
thus avoid the objections which bava ,
been urged against those heretofore created
by Congress, it will, in the opinion
of the undersigned, produce the happiest
results, and confer lasting and important
benefits on the Country. ' ; ^
The undersigned, therefore, respectful- ^
ly recommends the creation of such fiscal
agent, and repeal the act of July 4th,
1840, providing for the collection, safe*
keeping, transfer, and disbursement of ,
the public revenue," except the penal !
provisions thereof, which will probably
require revision and modification.
All which is respectfully submittedT.

Secretary of the Treasury.
