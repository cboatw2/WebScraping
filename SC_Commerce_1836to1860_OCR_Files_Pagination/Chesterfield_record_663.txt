recede from its disagreement to the amendment

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF : .
I I
SOUTH CAROLINA.
Gentlemen:?The lust year I had j
1 lie honor to address you on a topic of j
paiumount interest to your constituents. ; ,
Allow me again to solicit your atten- j
tion to the same subject. I presume it j
will not be contested, that agriculture is j
j tho basis of our prosperity, and that all |
proper means to further its progress, or :
to remove obstacles in the way of its a i- :
vancemcnt, should unhesitatingly he j
ad<?pted. It now appears to he generally I (
admitted, that to continue the rais. j
ing of Cotton tothe entire exclusion of j
sonic, and the partial culture only ofoth- \
cr valuable crops, would he a pernicious j'
error. The golden field to which self, '-j
interest invited us about forty years ago* j
no longer exhibits a remunerating return.
Guided by the same faithful monitor, our
present course is so obvious, that an ar. '
gument to show the necessity of pursuing j <
it, would be a work of supererrogation. j
There was a time when this Siate was j
, an exporter of Grain. The extension of
the Cotton culture soon effected an im
portant, and, in refcrenco to the com. i
inanity, a disadvantageous change in our ,
system of husbandry. From a statcmei t J
drawn from the late census, I infer th? t j
about three snd a half millions of acres ;
1 are appropriated to the production of
Corn, and from evidence upon which 1 j
I rely, South Carolina has purchased of j
; Ibis article, since 18'W, at the annual)
average rate of 5 )0,0(10 bushels. It is J1
apparent from these data, that if only- j
one.fourth of a luijshcl more per acre to the j
whole number of acres in tilth were j
grown, our granaries would not only he ,
re-established at home, but that we should 1
again he enabled to meet the foreign d?o
" \
niand to the amount of over 500,000 hush- j
, els for this great necessary of life ? Can ! (
not this he done? To the experienced i i
it is well known, tiiat 100 acres ot Cotton 1
judiciously manured, assuming the soil 1 (
to need artificial aid, will realize a larger
product in a series of years than 200 a- p
cres, where no expedients for enriching 11
the land are resorted to. Hence, whilst
i the consequences of the general adoption
of the meliorating process would lie the !/
| usual income from the planter's main
crop, his stock of Provisions, independently
of other decided benefits, which I will j
! not pause toenunicrate, would !>e vastly
augmented- To hring about this desiraI
hie state of things; to preserve confidence r
to the cotton grower, whose alarm and
embarrassments m*v in part he trace I to
| his credulity and listless energy; anil, by
the operation of wise and salutary regula- 1
i tions, to insure the means of a comforts, j1
Me subsistence to every yeoman who will j(
. take hold of the plough and not look !j
back, the aid of your influence, gentle- ;
man, I scarcely need assure you, enn nt !
this time he most beneficially extended.
Among the preliminary measures en- ! (
tilled to consideration, the formation of /
lorn I 4 floiiriiftiirnl Societies, is believed
to he the most prominent, t am aware I(
that the public mind is still restless and ;j
disquieted. He would therefore richly j i
I times a civic wreath who should succeed j i
. in arousing the cultivators of the soil to a ( '
, just sense of the dangers they have es- (
raped, and directing their untiring exer. , (
1 tions to the slow hut only certain mode j i
; ?>f supplying their temporal wnnt??--to in. .'
dtistry,temperance,and economv. It isevi/dent
that misfortune has already exerted j (
I its salutary power over many, still, I fcar, h
! that a few of our Agricultural brethren,
!
unmindful of the past, and stimulated by i
the wild gambling spirit which hnssprea.i
devastation through the land, aro vc
struggling with locomotive speed to bi
classed among the opulent, or, if ruin cn
sue, to be released from nil their obli^a
O
tions by the sponge of a Congressiona
statute.

true interests, from which the ininds o
the planters have too long and mischiev
ouslv lw?en estranged, hy the concentra
tion of intelligence, emanating froin th
establishment f?f neighborhood Sorietie#

VO THE DIFFERENT TEMPER VNCfe SOCIETIK
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
Tiie State Temperance Society, at its lai
Annual iMeeting determined on holding
meeting in Greenville, in the ensuing Suminei
Toe tiiqe is pnw fixed for the 2d Monday i
August, Each Society will be expected t
send Delegates; the number is of cotirs
very much in their discretion: but I?woul
suggest, that generally about ten delegates b
appointed by each society.
We have reached an important point i
the Temperance reformation ; the whole r
the Stat?i is aroused on the subject. If w
can act in harmony and perfect coijcert, th
good wljjcli m^.T he done is incalculable! Th
object of the Greenville Convention ')? to at
taut that desirable end.
I^'t us then, beloved friends, for the rcscui
of our companions, friend4, acquaintance!
and even "the stranger within our gates,'
come to the resolution to sacrifice a fev
days : and meet our brethren of South Caro
Una and North Carolina, in the sjght of ou
own majestic mountains. There by inter
changing thoughts, and becoming known t
yue another, we shall be able to form that ar
my of Temperance freemen, who will be a
unbroken and aa invincible as the Maccdoijj
an Phalanx. Let each society, (Washing
ion, Total Abstinence, or partial Abstinence,
lend up delegates. We are all acting forth
good of our fellow men, and by taking swee
counsel together, we shall not diminish ou
chance of success.
Wiio would not rejoice to know, that ther
was not, and n?ver hereafter would be.anoihe
drunkard in this fcJtate.! Such a state c
things would be the golden age, so beautifull.
but fabulously depicted in ancient poetry.ft
n.iv never be exactly attained. But w
t
+ J . -
j ! can approach if* if we fry. Tiie Republic of an
t ancient philosopher whi a creature of hie fancy,-r-Ojur
gallant and heroic fitliers surpassed
B the Philosopher's dream, in the U'?hle repub*
lican institution* of hberty and freedom, whicn
* ; they nobly won, and secured for themselves
| j and their posteri'y. A similar spirit of patient
j endurance, of unflinching purpose of pure
disinterested motive, n rid of harmonious ar.
r j tion, to that which they exhibited in Hie rev.
f J olution, will row conduct us to the acliieve.
I ment of as great * conquest, and bring about j
. | as great a deliverance, a* that which seven ;
I year's roil and blood aeccnrtplished for thetn. j
' j They thereby bpcame freemen. e hope to j
'* continue free, and to be sober.
; 1 For such consummation let therj be j
* ( one spirit among us, and let that be to excel,
each other in advancing the cause of Tom-1
J perance. Let us have but oae mind, and let j
' j that be to give up our own plans, and act
s j upon such aB will do most goou. These res
suits can only be accomplished by the TeniU
j perance Convention at Greenville. To it let
; all constantly look, and in it, let riery Society
s j be represented.
-j It is respectfully asked of the President of
