THE PRESSENT TARIFF.
Much is now said as the propriety, and
neccessity..of immediate State action. to
throw off the burden of this oppressive
rneasure. Judging from the press of the
State, a very large majority re opposed
to immediate action, and in favor of ' bi
ding our itme.' It is certainly not impos
sible, should Polk become President, fur
a reaction, in favor of the South, to tahe
place; and yet. judging from tle past. such
a thing is hardly probable. It may be
said with the certainly of prophecy that
the North will not consent to give tip the
money which they pocket by the Tariff
for Protection so long as they see a spirit
at the South too craven to resist it. We
think it equally certain. that when the
thole South shall become determined to
mau at the risk of the Union to reduce this
oppressive measure to a revenue standard,
the acquiesence of the North. in such re
duction wll be obtained. It requires but
little inforination to see, that, by a disso
lutiotn of the Union the North would be
greater - losers than the South. The
South can exchange her raw material for
- Etglish goods. Where would the North
get her raw materials 'froinl So that
whenever the South the *bole South be

TO THE PUBLIC.
HABURG, Aug.24 .
We deem it importanit, as well for the p
tection irthie Planter as the lorchant, that the
public should ti'corre'tly riformed, as to what
is the true stataing of thebtlls of the Bank of
Hamburg, both at home and-ab-road.
The Editorof the HamburgJouirnal, for some
selfish motive, has-thought-proper. from time
to time;to circulate through the m'dium 9f his
paper. a number of charges, touching the so]
veney of the Bank of Hambirg. For the pur
pose of aresting the fahe and nalicious denun
ciations of the Editor, we have thought proper
to solicit an investigation into the real standing
ofthe Bank, on which to predicate such infor
mation as the hill-holder might folly rely.
Were objects of the persecutionof the Bank as
well known in the country as tiey are here. we
should deem it quite unnecessary to notice any
of those misrepresentations.
On perusing his pager, you.will at once dis
cover the editor betray& his own ignorance; lor,
after telling you that the Bank is in a rotten
dondition, and cannot redeem her liabilities, he
turns round and quotes her bills at par in
Charleston, the great omporiuti: of the State.
Now it really seems to he a strange sortof logic.
that to render the standing of such an institu
tion doubtful at homie, should have the effect to
increase her good standing abroad.
We make no attempt to ustain the Bahk.
she is amply able to sustain herself; but only
aim at placing in your hands, snch informanion
as will prevent you from submitting to any dis
count from the face of the Bills of the Bank of
Hamburg. We say to yon, on the amhority of
the authority of the Directors of the Bank.
iCoeieone, come all." that prefer Gold aid
Silver toher bills, and she will prointly sedeein
theni 7 She lino, likewise, compared to her
circulation, a large amount of Exchange on
Charleston and New York, which she will fur
nish at the-lowest rates, to all who wish to make
remittaUces
it is a well kInown fact, that the standing of
t:ie Batnk has bIen as good as that of any other
Bank in the State; since the first commence
ment of her isrises. to the present titne. nlways
paying specie for her bills (when other Batiks
%ere.) and checking.at the lowest rates at the
North.
Thocitizens-of Hamburg. 1ield a meeting
this day, and appointed a Committee to wait on
the President and Directors of the Batik, and
to request then) to furnish the Commiiee with
such information as would enable them to give
satisfactory evidence to the people at large, that
the bills of the Batik are based on the best
foundation. You will see a public expose if
the standing of the flank. published in several
of the newspapers of the State.
The Committee of seven, appointed to wait
on the President and Directors, were H. L Jef
ers, G. Walker, M. R. Smith, Wim. Crn pon.
John Usher. John J. Howard. and A. Wray,
Esqrs, The President, Mr. H utchinson. cheer
rully submitted to their iiivestigationi, the affairs
of the Bank, and insisted on their miaking a
thorough examination of all the assets; but the
Committee.were satisfied after coniting Two
Hundred and Four Thousand, Eight Hundred
Dollars, and certify that to be the correct a
mount of' specie exy ibited for then t) con tst.
In conclu-ioo, we would say, the new crop
is niowready for tmasket. and we invite you to
Ltd n wth it. and as rr.nny as want Gold and
Sieirin preference to Hamburg Bank Bills.
shllihave it. Tie Bank has one of the best
Directions that could be selected, with an old
vtran in in banking affairs, at it- head, and
who has been, its years past. connected with
4everal of the Banks in lia State, and ac
knowledged by all to be an able Banker.

We know that so far as the Balik is con

Wewould therefore respetfilly ask you to

BANK OF IAMURG SO. CA,
Ak u ait 24, 1844.
Otntlemen:t Your favor of this morning is
before me, and it gives mue great pleasure to
coinply with your request. The statement
showing the condition of this Bank is imade out
every week for the inf6rmation of the Direc
tors, and'I herewith enclose you a copy of the
last. as fuirnished on yesrerday. The Batik of
Hamburg being ready at all times to meet its
circulation or any of its liabilities promptly., i
was not thought necessary heretofore to soctre
the repeated scurilous cfervesences of an irres
ponsible -Jonitril." and it is only in a sense of
pumoper respect due to yo, and those you rep
resent. theat it is done now It mnst be evident
to every impartial citizen. that the "Journal"
has lecen for the list twelve months drawimg in
its own poisons. It has actnaliy lackguarded
iielf to death. and began on the etst to weave
its own widing sheet, offering five dollars a
hlead ror pall betrers, and cryiig aloud fOr
muourners. Neither the Baik nor any of its
managers have had any thing to do in the tour
derous affair, either directly or indirectly, and
it is only on your account that we disturb its
remnins. I cantot imagine what iduces the
reputed editor to pursue the course he does. It
lie knows any thing he knows lie is giving vent
to a tissue of unt uths. hut if he knows noth
mg(which is said to be the case) then he should
say nothinig.
I do not entertain a doubt but what another
is the secret mover of the whole itfair. if so, we
sould not be surprised at nlly thing. "-Haa
man will never be satisfied while Mordecai sits
an the gate." As to the new pressspoken ol, I
know nothing sa'e this: Mr. Cochran asked
us, anoiong ot hers to subscribe, which we read
ily did, and we asked others also to do the
aine, believing that a decent conuionity is en
ticled to a decent newspaper. but if uniortir
niately his should prove ant idecent one, I far
one will withdraw froin it, and if every other
snbscriber will do the same, it will die aluo. It
is disreptable to any community tie patronise
at licentious press. lie who caters to licen
tions appe-tites aids in demoralizing the commu
iLtV, and im a disturber of tile public pence and
harmony [in reference to Col. Piciatss and
this intended newsptper I know nothing.
I doubt very much if Col Pickens (who I un
derstand is absent from the State) kinowys that
the prioject is in contenplation. tne thing is
very certain, there is no combination between
the Bank. and hinm on this or any other sub.
jet. I do no not believe lie will get one vote
ot of the whole direction and officeis of the
Hlairkt. although lie is the personal fti-nd of

Business generally is quite dull wit - us

There is considerable Flour comring

well furnished a- table in. all the esseutiils
if good eating, asany you will find in the
State in such establi.ihments. I flatter
myself that this watering place is destined
to he the most valuable. and moni freqen

effiracious sahme water that I have ever
used, and I have visited Saratoga, the dif

days. I have enjoyed opportunities of
conversing with gentlemein froin various
quarters of tho State upon -the interest
ing and in some places exciting tippics,
which are now heing agitated hefbre.ine,
people. To the oft repeated question.
what is the proper course for Souli.Caro.
linh to pursue. in I-er present situation, I
have heard hui one response. There is in
fact in this region or the State but one
opinion, i. e. that -he State shaould forhear
all agitation of the questions with which
!he is at issue with the General Grivern
ment. ati especially that she should sus.
pend all State action until after the Presi
dential election. Thi. ias. seemed to me
as the wisest and better course, not only on
the grnttnd of prudence but propriety.
The State consented to go iuto Conven
tion wilh the Democratic party of the
Union, which was proposed to be held at
iBtltidmre. for the purpose off selecting
c-indidattes for the ome of Pre4ident and V.
President. She was represented in formtally
