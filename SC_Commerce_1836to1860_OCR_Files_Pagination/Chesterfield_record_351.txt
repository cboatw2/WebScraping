of the sti'I greater and longer continued e
^ pansion which .has terminated in the ovc
throw of the banking system, and the de<
and almost universal distress of the roun'r
may bo clear'v traced back to the sat:
source. To do this, we must return to t
year '32, and trace the chain of events
this lime. In that year, the puMic de
was finally discharged. The vast rrveni
which had been poured into the Treasu
by the tariffof'28, and which had acceler
ted the payment of the p ibiic debt, coul
after its discharge, no longer be absorlx
in the ordinary expenditures of the Govor
ment, and a surplus began to accumulate
the Treasury. The late Bunk of the Unit*
States was then the fiscal agent of the 3?>
ernment, and the depository of i s revenu
Its growing amount, and prospects of gre
future increase, began to act on the cupidi
of many of the leading State banks ai
some of the great brokers ot i\ew ion
Hence their war against t! at iustitut'on
and hence, also, the removal of the d p
sites* The late President I believe :o hav
been really hosnle to the B mk on principli
but there woulJ have been lit'le or no inotu
to remove them, had it net b en for the
growing importance, tlnd the hostility whic
the desire of possessing them had excit r
They were removed, and placed in th
vaults of certain State banks. To this r<
moval and deposite in the Stab* banks 'I;
members over the way are in the habit (
attributing ail the disorders of the eunene
which have since followed. Now I ask,
; the first place, is it no; certain, if it had nc
been for the surplus revenue, thff
would not have been removed ? And, i
the stconJ, if there would have been a sur
plus had it not been for the tariff of '28 ?
Again ; is it not equally char that it wa
the magnitude of tie surplus, and no; tli
removal, of*itself that caused the after dt
mniremont and disorder ? If the surplu
A, -^
had been but two or thnw miliums, the ord
nary sum in deposite, it would have b'e
of htlle importance wluxo it was kepwhether
in the vaults of the B mk of ih
United Sates, or those of the States; l?i
involving, us it did, fifty m li ons and mon
it became a question of ih highest, import
ance. 1 ugaiu ask, to what is this go'a: s <r
plus to be ut:ribute ', bat to t e same c i >s
Yes, sir, the tariff of 1323 caused the sui
plus, and the surplus the removal and al
the aftec disasters in the cum ncy, agjr?va
ted, it is true, by being deposited in tli?
Stale banks; but it may be doubted Wiethe;
the disaster would have b en much less
had they not been removed. Be tli ?f
however, as it may, it is not m it?*rial, as
have shown, that surplus itself was the mo
live for the removal. W" uil renvmhe
what occured after the removal. Tim sur
dIus poured into the Treasury by millions
?~ -
in the form of bank notes. Toe withdraw
al from circulation, nti-1 locking up in tlx
vaults of the ivpositc b:?nJt , so^or^e an a<
mount, created an immense vaeuurn,To h
replenished by repeating tiro issu s w;?H
gave to the banks the means of unb-.nitiJei
accommodations. Speculation now corn
menced on a gigantic sc il- ; prices rose m
pidily, and one party, to make the rernova
acceptable to the p-ople, urg d tire n"w <Jr
positories to discount freely, wliile. :lie olhe
side produced the same off of, by censurin
them for not affording as ext nsivo accoin
modations as the Bank of the United State
would have done, had the revenue b .Hm |.-|
with it. Madness ruled the hour. Th<
whole com nuni'y was intoxicated withim
tignary prospects of realizing immense for
tunes. With the increased rise of price
began thegigan'ic specula*ions in ;he puhlx
domain, the price of which, b ing fix?*d b

To enlarge the room for th"ir oj^rations,
know not how many millions (fifty* I woult
suppose, at least, of the puolic revenu ) wa
sunk in purchasing Indian, lands, at t!?ei
fee simple price nearly, and removing tribt
after tribe to the West, at enormous cost
thus subjecting millions on millions of tin
choicest public leads to be seized on by th?
keen' and greedy speculator. Trio ti?i<
now swelled with irresisiible force. Fron
the banks the deposi'.es passed by d;scou..t
into the hands of the 1 aid speculators
from them into hands of the rcc-'ivcrs, an
thence to the banks ; and again and ngaii
repeating the same circle, and, at every re
volution, passing millions of acres of th
public domain from the people into the hand
of specula*ors, for worthless rags. l|,t<
*|his state of things coivioueJ much Idfrger
every acre of the public lands, worth pes
sessing, would have passed from the Government.
At this stage the alum tool
place. The revenue was attempted to b<
squandered by the wildest extravagance
resolutions passed th:s body, calling on th
Departments to know how much iliny cou'i
spend, and much resentment was felt be
cause they could not spend fast enough
Thedeposite act was passed, and the Trea
sury circular issued ; but, as for as thecjr
rency was concerned, in vain. Tue ex
plosion followed, and the banks fell in con
vulsions, to bo resuscitated for a momen*
but to full again from a more deadly stroll
under which they now lie prostrate.
I huve now presented, rapidly, the unbrc
Jien chain of events up to the prolific sourc
of our disasters, and down to the prcser
time. In addition to the causes originutinj
directly in the tariff of 1823, there were s<
veral collateral powerful ones, which hav
contributed to the present prostrated condi
tion of the currency and the banks, but whiel
would have been comparatively harmless o
* themselves. Among these was th?< imj or
^ tant change in the charter of the B mk o
England, at the Inst renewal, about the tun
our surplus revenue began to accumulate
by which irsno!<s were made a legal tende
in all cases, except between the bank inn
its creditors. The ohvious dlect of t?i
modifica'ion was to diminish the deman*
forspecie in that great mart of the world
and, in consequence, must have tendei
powerfully to keep the exchange with us i>
nn easy condition, while the tide of circui t
tion was rapidly rising to a dangerous height
But there was another causa which conti ib
so utcl still more powerfully to the sime
x- suit: I ref?'i'to the great loans negotiate!
:r- broad by States and corporations. To t
?p [ add the operation of the United S
v. B mk of Pennsylvania, the direct objec
Hi- vhica, in some of its m re prominent tri
In- actions, was to prevent the exchange f
to becoming adverse to us.
r_ c*
bi By I'm operation ofthf,se causes cor
je n?aJ, the exchanges were kept easy foryi
ry notwithstanding th" vast expansion wl
a. our circulation li id attained, from the p
I. erful action of die more direct causes
