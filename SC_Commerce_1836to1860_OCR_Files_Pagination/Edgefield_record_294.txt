THE TALL LADY'S APOLOGY.
Uphraid me not-I cannot feel,
Eternal love for thee;
A mao n ho is but five feet high,
Must not aspire to me.
I wonder sir. how you supposed,
That I would look so low;
I do not like to have it said,
I have so small a beau !
Besides. you must acknowledge, sir,
The bargain scarcely fair;
We never. sir, could make a match,
Although, we made a pair.
You know I'm tall, oh! very tall
Resembling much a steeple;
And, oh! I hate to look upon
Your stunted, little people.
'Tis true, the novelists have said,
A veil is o'er Love's eyes;
But I can see. (though -im 's the view,)
That you arc under size!
'Tis usual for a wire to take
Her husband by the arm;
Ti'nt he vihene'er they take a walk,
May shield her from all hai in;
But such a favor I'd ne'er ask
Frot such a little lover;
Wheii e'er we wa'k'd. I'd always fear
Some dog would him run over.
I own my sight is very good,
A glass I never wear;
Butt such as you I cannot see,
Without a glass, I swear!
Then. fare thee well, my little man
I ask no parting kiss;
My corsets will tint let me stoop,
To ghint a boon like ihis.
I will not weep, lest I should hurt,
So delicate a thing;
The tears that fall from such a height
Would ruin on it bring.
Sn eet manikin! Don't drown yourself
In my wash-bowl, I pray;
For fear of this, I'll tell the maid,
To move the bowl away.
If ever you should love again,
Love on a smaller plan;
For be- assur'd. n six foot girl,
Won't snit a little man!
Edgefldd C. H. r.
STANZAS.
Shadows of pamt years,
- Of happiness and smiles
Of inys bese: with tears
Of pleasures girt with toils-.
As ve flit along.
T'ho' ye bring with ye,
With then voice of song,
Strains of isery;
Still I love to trace,
As ye pass me by,
E'en fir a noinetit's space,
The faided shade ofjoy!
Voices seem to swell
Abmove me, and around;
Many a tale they tell
Uf joys tno longer found :
Of sies that ruthless Time
Htuth wither'd long ago.
Like lnw'ret past their pri~ne
Sore, silently anad slow ;
But yet to me they bring
linck dreamis of ithier dlavs
A visione of life's spring.
The'heart's ownt earliest lays !
Memory htath her hour-s
Of pleasume and of pain :
Of sunashine, storm, and show'"rs,
That fade and sptring again.
Yet when the shadows fly,
And voices greet the ear,
In all the pride of mnystery,
I love the sound~s to hear;
And pensively to trace,
As shadows pass ine by,
E'en fhr a mtomnit's space,
Th'le flittinig formt oh joy !
N . New Era. LEJGH CLEFF.
H-OPE.
Thought thick dlarkmess glooms before tis,
And a thonsand tempests blend:
Hope's bright rajinbow bending o'er us,
Tells its that the storm will end:
Chearinig life of half its sorrow,
Chasing hatlf its ills awaty;
WV iilh the stolmeee that to-mnorr-ow
Will be brighter than to-day !
Radiant star! shine on forever
In the I''u-un ,'s distatit skips;
Farther down Life's rapid river
There the land of promise lies.
On wve glid'-. of Glory dreniting,
Pride and Pleasure at the htelmn;
Ever art thon brightly pleamntivg
O'er that dim atnd'distant realm!
Though thou art as false and fleeting,
As the phantoms of the glen;
Still puirsuing. yet still retreating
Chteitiing all thte race of men t:
Yet not onie ofitemt wvoild barter
Thlat celestial smile oef thi ne,
For the glory-giving charter,
When the homeless stranger, sighing
O'er the last, last sand of life,
On the strength of God relying,
Nerves for him the final strife;
Ifell mayti all its legions rally
Fiends inay startile or alhre
If thon lightest Denth's dark valley,
He shall tread its -rloom secure!

HARD TO BEIAT.
I have lately received from <ome of my
farming frieids n few stalks of laden anid
other sorts of Cor. from 4 to 10 cars of
corn on a sinele stalk. One very curious
stalk was found in a paper of Chmna Beans,
and it wns left to grow with the Hean, a
solitary stalk. The gentleman n- ho raised
it was induced to take the tassels from an
adjoining pnitch of Corn, and shake the
polen of the flower over the silk of the
lonely stalk, and the result is tliat the said
stalk has eight pretty good ears on it, and
what is most sinenlar is that they are a
deep red Flint Carn. And now. Sir. Edi
tor, as my trtmpeter is nut of th way, I
will show some rare specimens of Corn
rnised in oy enrden. this year. Several
stalks .f Baden Corn, with eight good ears
on them, Long-Island or Pacific Corn, 10
earst Chinese or Tea Cort, 4 to 6 enr:
Beets from 104 to 14 1h. I will env to our
Farmers in the language of Washii'gton.
"I know of no pursuit in which more
real and importait services cai he render
ed to atny country, than by improving its
tioniculture."

FEEDING CATTLE.
Mr. Editor,-Yoit will oblige one of
your constant readers by pulbshing the
fhlloiwin!! extract. It ia short, hi not less
worthy. I would reconmend to all my
brother-fariners, who have adopted th'e
soi!iig svrem, to see that their cattle are
prolierly nttettded to and at regular inter
va s. Nothinag sltid lie permiied to
break in tipon and endanger yotr system.
for itipotn this, in a good degree, rests yotur
stccess:
- Regularity of feeding cattle is ofpritne
inporitram#e. Three times a dai. precisely
at a ce.tain hotr. aecording to Mr. Lnn
rence, they shoild lie furnished with their
food. M. Den observeq. that neat cattle
And horses shoult not have so nch laid
before them Itt once. as *ill quite ;erve to
fill them. The hay they have hreathed on
mutch, they nill not eat up clenn, unless
they are very hinery. It is besi, there
fore. to fodder them twice ht tight. nid
twice in the morning. Let n-at cattle as
well as horses have hotl light and fresh
air let in upon their fodder. when the wea
ther is not tar cold anti utorniy to allow th'e
windows to be open. What one sort of
cattle leave should be given to another
sort. Those who chew the eud will eat
the leavings of those who do not, aid
vice eersa."-Farmner's Cabinet.
MILK FRtOM COWS FED ON DIS
TILLERY SWILL.
At, animated disenssion is now going on
in the 'Jturnal ol' Ciumitmeree'iof N. York.
as to the quality of the milk which forms
the principal part of the siuply of that city.
We copy belon% one of the art icles of the
assailants. The "Comimittee of Milk
men" who have answered at great length
tot previos piec-q, present bt a very un
satisfactory defetice, and a very poor re
co~mmtendation of the commodity in wichel
they deal.--Ed Far. Reg.
From the Journal of Commerce.
The Joutrnal enntitot confer a greater
blessinig otn the commulnity than by pro
dncing a through reformtaitont in the mtilk
department. It is n subtject in which the
henthah atnd lives of thonsntuds are involved.
I have Ativeni some attention to it from the
circtunstance of havittg the constittution oif
a fine hoy. the deliency of whose mother
cotmpelled her to nurse frott thme hottle, etn
tirely tinderminmed, and scarred with bloteh
es to this day ; whlilenmy other chiildr'en.
nturscd at the breast, enjoy pierfect hentlh.
Unicertain of thte cauise of my boy's pining
and drouping, it at Lettgthi ocentred to tte to
analyze the milhk. whlic'h I fotnd to lbe the
mere dregs of a dlistillery ; scarre otte par
icle of tntrittnet to a pint. I fotund a
pinat of wvarmn water, a tenispnoon ftll of
flo'ir, arl 2 grainsidoftmagnesimi, to contaiti
mnore nuttriment thtan a pint of sswill, cal
led milk. On dliScovering this great secret
in the mtilk trade, I itmmediately ser.t to
Orange countty andt provided a youtng,
healthy, and $ounntrv-fed cow, which I
have had for fotur yeatrs. furnishing ahun
danice of good anid wvholesome ttiik.
It has ofrtn rnctred to mte as surprising,
tt'n' w~.:ie we huavr mtunicipal laws to reg
tu ate the iluality of horwzd stidE' the co'rpur
ation should lie pierfectly reckless of what
we administer to thic delicate stomachs of
our children. Tlhiere is tnot a more sture
anid certain poison thtan this swill tmilk.
Besidles its deleter.ionsq properties, a pint
does tnot contain stuficienut ntutriment to
support a child. DidI yotn ever make an
esttimate of the profitssat the milkmen ? If
not, I will do it for yon ; having had oc
casion to investigate the matter. It is ha
sed upon feeding the cows on swill merely,
from the distillery wh'ch ba rely keeps thie
cows alive. The swill is given themt warm,
and passes throntgh them with the same
rapiit a trhm he ill:n. t is all
converted into what is called mcilk. They
are milked three times each day, and fur
nish at each milkine from 8 to 10 quarts.
One barrel of swill cost,. 61 cents ana
will keep t wo cows a day, which will field
on the nverage 24 qunrts of mi-k. This.
at Gd. per quart, is 1 50 ets. Every cow
fel on swill yields a net prolit to the milk
mian. over expenses of delivery. &e.. of
$1 25 per head per day. There is no
branch of business so prifitable, and notie
so haneful to a conmuniiv of children.
For myself, I woil sooner pay 2s. ; quiart
for milk from grass-fed cows. than take the
swill at any rate. Yours, v.
A gentleman who was formerly n dis

ANECDOTE OF NAPOLEON.
Alier having gained the battle of Wag
rain, the Eiperor Napoleon established
his head quarters for a time at Schoenbrun.
atnd there occupied himelf, pending the
negoliations ir his A ustrian alliance, evith
reviewing his troops, and distributing
:rnong them rewari and honors. 'One
old and brave regiment of the line was
dr:rwn oit befbre him for this purpose. lis
enstom being '0 examine every corps indi
viduallv under the giidance o the officerg.
1ltr having formed the regitimenit into
crilimi, Naprileor entered aniong the
raktis. and bestowed pruises and decorn
lions onl all %% ho au pared ort hy of them.
Five hour he hspe in this occupation;
and at length, wI'hrn he lrd satisfied him
sIlr that no mrrar's claim,; had been over
iooked, he finished by saying aloud to
t he Coloairl:
Now, present to me the bravest sol
dier in your whole regiment."
In somtie case's this might have been a
diffienlt mattcr; it did not appear so niow.
The Colomel. indeed, hesitated for a mo
ient : but ile (liestioi n asealelt by the
soldiers. and (one tniversal an-wer camco
frim the ranks.
"Sljorio! Corporal Morio'" was tho
cry.
The Colonel approved of the decision,.
and Alorio was cnlled fori ard. ie was a
marn still yo rung. hut embrowned by ser
vice ; and ie aiready wore (in his person
three lindges (if merit, and the cross ofthe
Legiioni of Honor.
" Ai," snhl Napoleon. looking at him
attenti ely, " you have seen service !"
L'ifteen years, my Emperor," replied
lori; 6"ixteen enmpaigns, and ten
woUids. iot to speak of con usions."
- How many great battles?" asked the
Emperor.
" Sire, I was at your heels at the bridgo
of Arcola ; I nas the first man i% ho en

mv knapsiek for your pillow at the bi
ntneic of U11m, when forty thlousand Aus

of Atistirlitz. It was I who served voin"
" Hold ! it is %%ell, very well! A'orio,
I naer you Baron of the Empire; and to,
that till I add -t hereditary gift of five
thousard francs a year.
Acelamations rose anew from the sol
