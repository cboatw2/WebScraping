To the Legislature?In my annual Mes- c
sage I informed the Legislature that the State
of Virginia hud adopted a new law calculated (
to embarrass our commerce, and which would 1
go into effect on the first day of May next, un- t
less this State should see fit to comply wfih cer- i
tain requirements made by our sister Slate. 1

ral Assembly ot South Carolina, on the seventh j
day of Dene.nher, one thousand eight hundred
'? and forty-one, enacted a law declaring that it >
shall not he lawful lor any vessel of any size or
description, owned in whole or in part, or commanded
or navigated by any citizen or resident
of the Sta'eof New York, or any such vessel
owned in whole or in part, or commanded or
navigated by any other parson than an actual inhabitant
and resident of South Carolina, and
departing from any port in the Commonwealth
? to any port of New York, to leave the waters
of South Carolina until the commandant of such
vessel have submitted to search and have cornf.
plied with restrictions similar to those attempted
to be imposed upon our vessels found in Virginia
by the law of 'hat Stale.
I submit a copy of the act of South Carolina,
by which it will be seen that the law will take
effect on the first of May next, but thai the
Governor is authorised to suspend its operation
on being officially informed that the Executive
of New York has consented to comply with the
demand of the Siate of Virginia, hitherto disallowed,
for a surrender of certain persons as
fugitives from justice, and that the legislature
of this State has repealed the act of 1840, extending
the right of trial by jury!
We are indebted to the courtesy of the Gene
ral Assembly cf South Carolina, for a reporl
and resolutions setting forth the grounds of their
very extraordinary proceedings. Since that
proceeding contemplates certain specified action
by the Executive as well as by the Legislature
of this State, as a condition upon which the
citizens of this State shall hereafter enjoy unmolested
in South Carolina, rights and iinmuni- J
tics guaranteed to them by the Constitution 1
of the United ""States; I have respectfully com- i
municated to the Governor of South Carolina 1
my decission upon the proposition thus submit- ?'
ted to me. That decision is in maintenance of the <
f rounds heretofore assumed in my correspon- s
ence with the authorities of the State of Vir- <
ginia. f
The General Assembly of South Carolina
pronounces our law, extending the right of trial v
by jury, an act which is the most alarming and
dangerous form in which fanaticism or folly has i
made its assaults on an ancient domestic institution,
cherished in the hearts of the people of
the South; and they very clearly and fully set
forth the reasons for this opinion.
I submit them in full confidence that they h
will receive that.early aud deliberate considera- p
tion which is due to them, not only from the tl
magnitude of the subject and the shortness of it
*? .. the period which is to elapse before the ri^or- ti
v- ous measures of Virginia and South Carolina ai
"*i?i vC will take effect, but also the respect to Soutli b
^ "Carolina which lam sure is entertained by the je
people of this State. My own views of the law li
in question differing essentially from those pre- t<
sented ra the papers now submitted, have airea- e
dv been made known to the Legislature.
WILLIAM IL SEWARD. n
o
State of X. York, Executive Department, ) a
Albany, February 10, 1842. \ F
Sir?I have had the honor to receive your ri
communication of December last, transmitting C'
to me a copy of a law passed by the General ti
Assembly of South Carolina, entitled 'An act h
to prevent the citizens of New York from car- S
rying slaves or persons held to service out of it
.-this State, and to prevent the escape of-persons k
charged with the commission of any crime,"? k
This communication is accompanied by a perti- di
neat report and by resolutions of the General' ai
Assembly, explaining reasons of the enact- d
ment.
The act declares that it shall take effect from n
and after the first day of May next, and that k
the Governor is authorised to suspend- its opera- Cl
tions, upon being officially informed that the L
Executive of New York has bona fide consent- S)
edto comply with a demand heretofore made by | P
the authorities of Virginia for the surrender of j w
ic- Peter-Johnson, Edward Smith, and Isaac Gain-. w
sey as fugitives from justice; and that the Legis-! w
lotuvn a f tl?io line? rnnAolft/1 o lo?? noeofl/1 ! Ill
in 1840, extending the right of trial by jury to u
persons claimed as owing service in otlier w
States, under proceedings before theoSicers and c;
magistrates of this State. a
It seeins my duty, therefore, with the frank- w
ness of communication which ought to prevail
between the several States of the Union, to' b
make known to your Excellency, as I have I a
uniformly and on all proper occasions informed j s1
the State of Virginia, that the Executive of this
State declined to comply with the requisition of! <1
the Executive of Virginia referred to in the act 0
of South Carolina, Upon the grounds that the I
process was deemed to be without warrant or >'
authority in the Constitution of the United v
States, or in the Jaws and customs of this 1
State, and that nothing has occurred since tliat i '1
decision was made to change the convictions j 0
then entertained. i1
Whether the law of this State extending the i 0
trial by jury, be unconstitutional or injurious to j b
the State, is a question which probably belongs j Tto
the Legislative Representatives of the people, j a
aniL'fias b een commended to their respectful; e
consideration. It also belongs to them to con- t
sidcr, at least in the first instance, whether the r
measure which the State of South Carolina has s
adopted calls for any action on the part of this t
State. I have, therefore, very cheerfully com- I
plied with your Excellency's request by submit- 3
i- _ ii ? i... ii._ t
ung iu uie legislature me papers you nave 1
transmitted.
Iremain, with very high consideration, t
Your most obedient servant
WILLIAM H. SEWARD. 1

Governor of South Carolina. c

THE U. STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN.
Every American, whose heart beats for his t
country, feels a lively interest at this crisis with c
our inveterate enemy, old England. Our present t
relations with that Government cannot long, ex- I
ist. We are in a crisis, and in a short time pub- j
lie opinion will force us into a war, or iorce \
England into an honorable peace. The people a
throughout the countrv have turned their atten. (
tion to this subject, and are giving it that serious 1
consideration, to which it is entitled. t
Yet tt is strange to sec the people on one side t
of this subject and their public agents oh the oth- i
er. A great portion of the Government of the 1
jjeople is opposed to the people. Mr. Webster, i
the official organ of the President, in foreign re- c
lationsis more friendly to England than one of 1
<. ... * jf r

ter own subjects. Mr. Everett, our Minister at v
jondon, is in the same interest, and Mr. Adams, w
vho is at the head of the Committee, in the a
louse of Representatives, on Foreign Affairs, is b
>f the same school and family; a British trio!
Mr. Webster, throughout his whole life has s
txhibited as much attachment and devotion to p
Sngland, as ever Lord Wellington did. He en- i
ered Congress during the late war and opposed 1
t with 50 other Federalists during his whole of- c
ficial career. The British army was in the field c
against us, while Mr. Webster was in Congress i
living thb same British enemy his aid and votes, i
He was one of the same cor pa and party, that t
did more lor the English in the late war, than one 1
flnntc.' tlmt infested our <
UU1J Ui J1U.I UIUIIUO I.UU iiwwui
shores. Was he not one ol' the same party with '
Gov. Strong of .Massachusetts, who refused to '
let the militia of that State "go out cf (lie State to <
fight the enemy.1 Was he not one of the samel
party that met in convention : t Hartford to dismember
the Union! and was lie not one of the
same party that raised the blue lights around the t
Federal shores of New England, to show the
enemy how to land?
Each and every one of the same party inust:
be accountable for the acts of the whole part}'.!
11 Mr. Webster disapproved of the course'oi his;
party, why did he not come out from among;
them, and leave them? His remaining with thciu
and knowing their acts and intentions, is the!
strongest evidence that he approved of their |
course. Some raised blue lights, while - others j
voted in Congress against the war ui every particular,
and some were in active operations in
the Hartford Convention to disembcr the Union,
while others, as above stated, were in Congress
speaking against and voting against the war.?
All were of the same party and of tlm same
stock in politics.
For these statements, we have the Journals of
the House of Representatives, and we have also
living witnesses ol facts we state. If it became
necessary to prove facts, w.e would call on Mr. 1
Gales and his paper to sustain theso charges. 1

THE HEW BRITISH ENVOY. j
The mission of Lord Asliburton seems to be ,
ivolved in no little ra3'stery. Whether it is sun)y
confined to tka pecuniary relations between _
te individual States and England, which is ceri
nly a-ubject of vast importance.to botJi par- f
es; or whether his lordship is charged with the '
Jjustment of one or ail the difficulties existing u
etween the two countries, is but matter for con- u
icture. The English papers throw but little ?
ght on the subject, and are somewhat incohsisJnt
with each other in their notices of his lordhip's
contemplated embassy.
In the mean time, we are informed by certain 'J
ewspapers, and correspondents of newspapers ^
f our own growth, that his lordship married an n
unerican lady; that he had at one time resided in n
'hiladelphia; has properly in Pennsylvania -in s
ght of his wife, and is thus connected with the V1
ountry Dy alliance, uy iiiieresivuuu aco?Lw
on. We are, moreover, assured, that though
e possesses a large lauded estate in the United
lates, and has some two* three, or four States u
1 his debt to the tunc of a hundred thousand dol- ''
trs, or pounds?we forget which?each, yet his tl
irdship is so rich that he could never be persua- [|
ed to pay the least attention to this property, tj
ad is quite indifferent whether the States repu- Q
iate their debts or not
From this we might reasonably infer tint his 11
lission has no connection whatever with State "
onds, or any pecuniary considerations. But we h
anfess we have strong doubts on .the subject, ?i
ord Ashburton, it is true, retired from business d
jveral years ago, and invested great sums in the u
urchase of the Marquis of Onnond's estates, if
e remember right. Whetlior be left any, and t|
hat, portion oi'his funds, in tlie hands of his sons, .
ho were associated with and succeeded him in
usiness, we cannot say. As it is, however, fl
sual in such cases, there is no improbability I1
hatever, iu the supposition that a part of his s
ipital was left behind, and its sudden withdraw- n
I would probably have crippled the v;ist and
rwln1,r nv?on,lo,l hiu-ir.oc-Q in U'liic.h ii. is ko well
nown this groafhouse v. as, and is still, so deep- jr
engaged. This is not, however, very matcrt1
to the subject; it. is certain that his sons contitnte
the principal partners in the house of Hang,
Brothers and Company, and that conaeuently,
his lordship pn:.-t feci aP the interest
t a father in its prosperity.
That this house is deeply interested in the late
iterehange of borrowing and lending, which
rent on so swimmingly for a while between the
wo countries, no one can reasonably doubt.?
,'iiey were for a long time the agents of the Bank
if the United States, and the credit of that insliutiou
abroad greatly depended on the guarantee
if this intimate connection. It next to impossiile
thai the principal should fail, without, in some
neasure, involving the agent; and the extreme
nxiety felt as to the fate of that institution, is
winced by the celebrated circular, which cannot
>e so soon forgotten. This house has, in like
nanner, exhibited equal solicitude for the asump'.loii
of the State debts by the United States,
vhich, though at the present moment it would
>e only one bankrupt volunteering the debts of
mother, was then thought a complete salvo for
he broken down credit of the States. If this
iousc was not a creditor, this anxiety Was exremely
disinterested, to say the least; and if the
ive thousand dollar fee to Mr. Webster, to get
lis opinion of the constitutionality of the State
>onde, had no connection with their individual
:oncerns, we have only to adtuirc this disinterestedness
the more.
For these and other reasons, we are of opinion
hat the mission of Lord Ashburton, if not solely
onliued to, is intimately connected with, State
Kinds. lie is emphatically the proper person to
ie employed in such a business. The coin ed n
iroclaimed by those who are heralding his arri>al
which he many years ago formed with the
imilyqf Mr. Bingham, ever}'one of whose children,
it is believed,have expatriated themselves;
lis former residence in Pniiadelpaiajlus uncein-1
miate connection in business wuri the principal c
ncrchants of the United States; the still more j
ntiniotn connection between his eons and our
iiiancial and mercantile alfairs; his lordship's
ank and wealth, and, we may add, the maturity
>f his talents and experience, a-1 these well tit
iim for exercising great influence 'here, even11
; > ^ * t
rithout the amiable relation of Iawyey and cjieii't'
,'hich was lately established between his sons ' _
nd Mr. Webster, and whicb cannot but a lib rd
im great collateral advantages.
On the whole, we hope the best from this mision,
tiiough \vc cannot uunnduige a latent ap- .
irehension that, however intended, ttwiJl result "
n strengthening and consolidating that baleful
3ritish influence, which, aided by the servility of
lebtors; the liopes of those who may anticipate 1
lomtnercial advantages from his lordship's pal- j
opage; the rising of the old Tory leaven; which j.
s not yet extinct among us; and, above all, by ,
lie tra.turous spirit and treasonable designs ol a c
anatical'sect, it is much to be icarod, may be- s
tome too strong for the warning of Washing-' {
roN,or the spirit 01 patriotism. YV e do not mean <

leceivc or betray them. . {

in relation to the Tariff and an economical c

[utions will be found below, and we call the es- *
pecial attention of our readers to the second and a
tifth Of the series, as affording food for the most *
profound'reflection. We call their attention fur- 1
ther, for the purpose of showing the candor and 1
honesty of the party who succeeded in attaining '
power in 18-10, by the same system, of humbug 1

produce a sufficient revenue to support the Go- '
;ernment, and in the next moment ask for the '
epeal cf the provision referred to in the resolu- c
;ion, in the distribution bill! _ 7 1
Mr. Clay, in his resolutions, says that a reve- i
lue of twenty six millions is wanted. The im- *
jorts into the United States are estimated at one *
luudred and five millions. Twenty per cent on v
his amount would produce twenty-one millions; 1
o which, if the distribution act was repealed, *
night bo added five millions, from the proceeds v
if the public lands, making, according to Mr. *
Slav's own showing, a revenue amply sufficient *
or all the purposes for which the Government' v
equires money. Mr. Clay's resolutions would e
iave been more candid-add more honest, if they
iad been couched in the following language, 1
;hich is at least, what tliey really import:? V E
"Resohed, That a duty of twenty per cent on 0
ne hundrpd millions will not produce a reve- a
ue of twenty millions of dollars for the support Q
f Government, and allow us to give away ten
ullions in the way of bribery."
But our leisure will not permit us to pursue n
ic subject further at present We add the Re- l!
alutions referred to at the commencement;? 61
Resolved, That it is the duty of the V
rcnerol Government in conducting its ad.iinistrati"n,
to provide an adequate reve?
in* within the year to meet the current
xpoises of the.year, and that any expedi.
nt i-iiher by loan or Treasury notes, to ^
:ipply, in time of peace, a deficiency of
t*venue, especially: during 'successive VV
ears, is unwise, and must lead to pertii- m
tous const quences. ot
2. Resolved, That such an adeaualc al
?venne cannot be oblaitlec] by duties on ei
>reign imports without adopting a higher ^
ate than twenty percent, as provided for ?a
1 the Compromise act, which, at the time
fits passage, was supposed and - assumed

ulies on fi>reign imports ought to be aug- to
icnled beyond the rate of twenty per cent, ht
t? as to produce a nett revenue of twenty. 0l
ix millions of dollars?twenty-two fur the
rdintry expenses ol Government, two lor'
he payment ol the existing debt, ami two j]
liHions as a reserved fund for contingen- q
ies> . . w
4. Resolved, That in the adjustment ol
tariff to raise an amount of twenty-six |e
ii I lions of revenue, the principles of the
Compromise act generally should be ad- re
ered to; and that, especially, a maximum cr
ate of ad valorem duties should be eslub
shed, lrom wntcii mere ougut to oe as

5. Resolved, That the provision in the

ing the operation of thai act to be suspen- by
cd, in the contingency of a higher rate of
