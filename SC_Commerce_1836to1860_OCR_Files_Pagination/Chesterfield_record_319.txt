Cultivation of Cotton.

the Pea Dtu Agricultural Society at its Semi,
nun iul meeting in October 1833, by tho
lion. John Campbell.
The first object of considor.rion in the
cultivation ol cotton is the golociiou of a soil
? suited to its production. Hut us every v ?ncfV

exe?*pt to (vinark, that from an exhausted

the most finyorable seasons, to expect an

t ? prepare it lor planting.
in prope^ preparing land for planting

pensable, and among the rules which may

are these : 1 ivory part of ill? so I should

i iH : usual iluJ best method of planting
cotton is on ridg?*8, i!??? cent es of which

I'poa all sods the observance of this rule is
important, hut particul ?rly up n such as are i

A her tho plants are up, commences n
most important part of tho cultivation ; and
hero tho Committee will remark, that
practical resul s on the culture of C >:ton are
varied so much by circumstances, that it is
impossible to lav dow i rul??8 wheh will be
ot one orxal application. But depending almost
cn'irely upon ox|?erience and observation,
and very little upon theoretic rensoning,
every judicious planter will be regulated
in the management of bis crop by tlio"
condi ion of his fv 11. The first process
however, after the cOUon is up, is generally,
in common language, ?to chop out."
Tms o|ieration is performed by drawinp
tiio boo rapidly across the drill ut short interval,
leaving between each chop throe or
much gjj^ i^

much greater uniformity in tho method

remarked, in general, taut where tho sod is

to remove tho grass where the plough cannot

whole management of his estate in the handi
of another.
I wil1 slate tie overseer system, siniplj
and plain v. Admit that a planter employ!
a good over-er, who conducts Ins busnj-ss
generally, well enough, (clways denying
iiowever, that tlies overseer can conduct it
, tteller than the employer, if ho has any goo?l
habits ol business.) Under such an over;
seer, the plantation may be put and kep! ir
! good condition, but the usual result is thai
the overseer d> m.mds an inereuse of wagei
lut th" rxpuation of each year, until al
length the employer will give hnn no more
and h" seeks employment elsewhere. Th?
planter gels nno'tier?a bad ono?the chan
f't are against him. foi (inditleR'Hl or b:n
overseers are more numerous than goo<
ones ) The plantation becomes unprofitable
under his manogcinen'? ho in turn is re
placed by unother, and after a course o
years, under good, indifferent, and bud ovt r
seers, ilit; owner ubaudons a fine climate

of finding elsewhere .1 country where hi
labors will he rewurd?*d ; but vain will In
his hopO'i if ho continues always to triss
entirely to another, what ho ought in grea
part to do himself.
I is a great but 100 common error of 1110s
persons to suppose that any fool cun mak(
a good planter. Parents have often heei

is not necessary to the planter is a gr"a
! cause of failure among ?hat class of men

"rom which such properties arc most likely

otially numerous, nnd bred and ra sed ut

no who understands his interest, jet the

t m their prime, would Lave dor.c more
auiU than any inferior bred horses ofhbeir

every one, who has the means, does as bo
pleases, and 1 only w ish 1 can scarcely
hopi', h.v some individuals or companies or
;it* ieutlural societies would import a bay
Tmk, a b .y Barb and u Cleuvelund buy,
und bay dray, or draught horse. The Cleveland
buys arc said to tic almost uniformly
of bay color and universally gentle in harness.
1 liuve seen a few matches from
the north, apparently half breds. excellent
in harness, of the dcsiri d size and shape.
Draught hors ?, perhaps cquul to any,
might be had in Virginia or Pennsylvania.
'i lie s'ock should all be selec cd by a com.
potent ju tgo of lior.se fl -sh, and tho two
coarser kinds should be chosen not only
v\ i:h a view to th'irown soutness, but fumu
iy stoutness and gentleness ut work, and
vvitli a scrutinizing eye to their hoof* and
pastern*. Brittle horn, gummy ankles, or
tendency to grease in the heals should bo
;<n insurmountable objection to a horso
however perfect in oiIht respects. Wo
would of course have to chooso t!ie temper
of the Bubs and Turk*, though a man
thoroughly conversant with horses can frupn
certain indications form a tolerably correct
estimate of tie ir temper*. A person but
moderately acquainted would be able to
know that Bdslmzzur was quiet, and that
St. Giles was " queer." Tho mares to bo
selected, should be well bred, of bay cr
brown colour nod a few greys. They
should have long heads, wide between the
eyes, and jaws well displayed, with clear
p'ucul eyes,and open foreheads, with pointed,
u II set curs, and fniq muzzles, and nostrils ;
necks of moderate lencth nnd mticivilnp
with large detached windpipes ; lia
fjuarters before and behind with plenty of
muscle ; large bodies with large ribs, and
the short l ibs eloso to the hips ; sanding
even m.d rather w'de on legs abounding ia
hone mid sinew, and terminated by tough
hi ick hoofs. A white pastern and iu of is
ahout ns liable to disease ns those of hlttc^c
or dark c1 csnnt colour. Tlio Stallion?
should he of nmilur shape, hut more coarseness
is tolerable in thein, particularly about
the n?-ck. Ti e mures ahovu described of
SI 5 1-2 hur.ds hi^h or upwards should be put
to the Barh and Turk, those under,to the
Clenvelund hay. Those three crossn in
the general would produce stock oi suffictei
