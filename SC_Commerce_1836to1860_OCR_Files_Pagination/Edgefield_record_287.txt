Who keep yeour wi.e in cobwebs wrapped,
And take its age yoeur boast;
The oldest wine your vaelts have knbwn,
From press fir %,at to flow.

Catee down te fill out cups one night,
Six thousand years a ;o.
Ye cha'mpions ofcold water
Who qiaff that drink dlivine;
Who've given your rumt end brandy o'er,
And bid adieu to wioe.
The b.attl"s tiamt ye crack to-day,
By God's own hand are given;
Some- in eaeth have their birth,

The graite tock and .pritg are those,
And these the clouds of heaen

AN EDITOLt'i MORNING CALLS.
A lady who is preparing for a great din
ier party, has one advantage at least in
saying. that she is not at home when a
call is made upon her; but the editor of an
eveving paper cannot possibly plead that
excuse. So he must either be non est, or
be ready to receive all visiters. We had
one day last we k to "sit up for com
pany," as it is called, and we kept a me
morandum to mark the number of visiters.
and the idiversity of subjects they dis
cussed ; and they came it such rapid suc
eeQsion, and for so niany different objects,
that it was amusing to witnese the con
tract. Talk of an eiitor bein of nio con
sequence on this mundane square ? Why,
he receives more visiters than a minister
of state; is asked to do more obliging
thines ; is required to perform more active
services; and his advice on all subjects is
courted with more anxious solicitude.
True, he -iets lite or nothing in return fir
all such civilities; he is only an editor
after all-a kind of fore horse to the public
team-a leader. with a hit in his mouth,
which solime one else holds.
- Will you be so kind." said a lady,
as to publish our call lor a meeting ofthe
Charitable Kuitting aend Darning Sociely?
We are quite poor, Mr. Editor, and cant
poay ; and the poor, you know. tiust not
be neglected-our Bible shoni s this."
" Certainly, niadani, it shall lie pub
lished."
" And prav. Mr. Editor," said another
visitor, " do notice a tremendous fan.
after the fashinin of the (Canon Punkas,
which I have in my eatingroon, to keep
offthe flies, and .make the rootn cool-it is
quite a novelty, I assure you."
"I will enleavor to call at your house,
and look at it."
" M r. Ediwr." said a bustling little man,
" put on yotr hlat, and go tap witb tme to
462J Water-street, and see a newly-in
vented gridiron, which saves all the
gravy."
As he was despatched, in marched with
infinite gravity, two of the Bedouin Arabs,
recently performing in this city, and after
uaking a salm.. they retreated a few
steps, atnd begatn their speer~h thus:
Salam alay-Konmn-uena ma re
hobbi ghayr ke Qobaylah ajut baeb
Uezous ek ettoma be salamah keer duhloh
ma rayua-k."
" Oh ! Arabic is it?7 (We tmust brush
ap l ttle ) So, so-the manager hias
ented you out of' $70, yotu say, hir your
pierliormatnce ? Nuiw listen : Akua aate
huatyu keisyr qobalah zirhah oueddy le.

money, and get.hiim bastnadioetd. lie sn
tisfied, my friend,.that you have only lost
youtr money, without bteing hastintadoed
yoturselfinto the bargain.."]
So sayina, they miade theirsalamns, and
retired. [low cruel it is to cheat poor
straingers thus! In walked a birisk little
milit ary-lotoking getntletman from Texas.
" I have "rought you the latest papers,
sir-every thitng goes on well in TIexas
no apprehesioni at all from Mexico-i: is
her imterest to make peace with us, and
utterly out of her power to send an army
att this or any time, to operate against us.
Yiiu are often spoken of in Texas. sir, as
one of her earliest friends-amost the first,
in fact, who adlvocated her indepe.ndence
in the Northertn States. I exp)ected to
have seen youm off'eed a seat in her cabitnet,
or receiving a section df land."
SAll in goodl titne, sir," said I. " Re
publics are not ungrateful."
Int walkeid " the olid bioy in specs.," and
w- tilked of Clay's cheering prospjects-of
the foolish timidity amotng his frienids
of the ntecessity of some prompt movemett
in his behalf at this time.
Scarcely had he departed, when a pritne
young gentlhettiat, with chamois leat her
loves ont, wished to know for a bet, only
todiecide a het, what the meanitng wats of
"anti poastnmorteim."
A mtessage from Sanidy Welch, to an
nonntee that the next day he was to slay a
einetrnl~iu-cs t'artl.
The door flew open, and in walked a
myslierions-looakiy,~ pe'rsaoage:
" Doi you know n by the Great Western
backed her wheels towards the Brooklyt
shore when bound out ?"
" I do not."
It was to iake in a passenger."
No, was it ?1
"Anti who do you think that passenger
was ?"
I cannot guess."
"Colonel %% ebb."
You dl11n't sav so."
Yes hut I tio; andc what do you think
lie has gone to England for ?"
Cant say."
" To dine with Mr. Webster, Lord
Wellinaton. and Mr. Peel."
k it i possible ?"
Yes, and he comes back in the same
ship."
Such is a slight view of the many morn
ing calls which the editor of an evenimig
paper receives daily. How nany more
the morning editors are favored n ith.
we cannot say ; hut if it proves any
thing, it goes to show the important
sweney of the press as, as a tiediun ofr
communication with people. and how
-autionls its contdutors should be, having
an agency of such delicacy and conse.
quence placed at their sole disposal. while
at the same time It proves to the public
how Revere, and laborious, and searching
are the duties of ant editor-and the claims
the press really has to protection and pa
tronage.

Your petitioners are confidernt there ik

are the protectors ofthe public welfare, tie
