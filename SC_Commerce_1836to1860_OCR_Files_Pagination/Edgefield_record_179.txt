ACCiDET- ON TOERAIL RoAD.--Wo
regret to leart, that an accident, of a serf
onr nature, though fortupately'not affecting
{he lives or limbs of persons,occurred on the
Rail folad on: LMond'ay evening tart. Whaen
the slwuward -train ofcars arrived within
a mile of Woodstock, the Locomotive ran
off tlbo road, and'consequently drew after it
the tender, baggage, and, several of tle
freigl't cars, Also a car contatuing several
.ras horses, belonging to Col.. Hampton.
atnd others. A number of cars were shat
terod to atoms from the concussion, and
several of the horses injured--one or two of
them, it is reported, so badly as to lead to
the belief that they will be incapacitated
.liom any more appearing on the turf. A
servant was in the car with the horses, at
. the time the accident occurred, but escaped
with little or no injury. The horses were
taken from the itail Road, and arrived
" hero yesterday forenoon. The passengers
wore. brought down between d and 4 o'clock
yesterday morning, by a Locomotive that
was despatched from sown to their assis-.
tanco, as soon is information of the occur
rence was received. Capt. J. C. Ker the
proprietor- of Woodstock, hastened an ex
press instantly to town, to give notice of tie
misfortune, rnd, with. his usual urbanity,
-,and promptituide, allbrded every assistance
in his power.
It is particularly unfortunate that this cir
curmstance should have taken place at this
period, as wo fear it may aflfect, somewhat,
the sports of the Turf, during the comiing
week. We hope, however,that none of Col.
II.'s favorite nags have sustritned such dati
age as to prevent his engaging in the con
tests for the various purses to ho run for.
Should he not participate in the week's
amusement, the circumstnnce should be a
source of much regret to the sporting con
munity.

In the House this morning. Mlr. Mullen-.
herg's resignation of his seat was announced
by the Speaker. Mr. Viso expressed his
great personal regret at.this annuciation of
the intention of Mr. M1. tsMeave the capitol.
lie had known that gentleman ever sipce
he came into public life, and no-man was
his superior in personal amiability o poli
tical patience. With great humility and
ftirbearance he had borne theburdens of his
party; and while ie regretted that t.he gentle
uan had escaped the application of his reso
lution against the appointment of members
to executive office, lhe congratulated) the
gentleman on being thus removed from the
toil rnd turmoil of polities here and in Pemn
sylvania, and being sent to a haven of rest,.
far abroad. This speech was followed by
some laughter from every part of the Hall.
The louse spent the day itfthe cousider
ation of private business. '1'Te bill, granting
.S103,000 for the payment to the hei-s of
Robert Fulton.. of certain claims heretofore
imade rigainst the Government by Mr. Ful
ton, was discussed at great length, nrd was
warmly opposed and earnestly supported
Mr. Legare, of S,.C. and Mr. Hoinan, of
N. Y. advocated the bill in a most eloquent
and triumphant manner. The bill was final

that the loss of Mr.'Coke by the burnng of
his property.in the'ront $tieet Theatre s

and Mr. Cooke hiiself states in a;: eaid;
which we insert below, that t' retas- nio
insurance of any part of it, n 'atisL lo*s by
fire. We have heard It suggested, and We
think it very probable, that the duties paid
by Mr. Cooke on the importatipn of.his val-.
uable property, would be remitted or, re
turned to him on applicatloay.to Congress.
The cages of .the sufferers by the great. fire
in N. York, are worthy, precedents, itich
undoubtedly would be followed on the pre
sent occabion that offers 'as strong a claim
for relief us"any that has over occurred.
In our notice of the Fire in - Sunday's
Gazette, we.stated that the Mayor in con
sequence of the receiptor an anonymous let
ter, had " directed a nightly- watch to be
kept at the theatre, which had been coutin3
ned to the time of the fire." We hive
learned to day, that the direction wvas given
to several city oflicers to watch on a par'ti-c
ular night specified m the anonymous letter
,as that during which the attempt would be
made to burn the Theatre but on the assu
rance from Mr. Cp'oko that four persons of
his.company, would remain every night
in the house, the attendance of the city otli
cers tweas not tontinued. The iour persons
contcnplated liy Mr. Cooke were in the
house when the flames were discovered, but
not waotching--two of them with difficulty
ef'ected their escape.
A (Card.-Mr. Cooke begs leave public
ly to ncktnowledge the ardent. though iner
'ctual, struggle of the Baltimore Firemen
to preserve some remnant of his lost prop
erty ; those elTerts, though vain, do not the
less inspire a real feeling of gratitude-.
It may not bc deencd impertinent at
tliis overwhelming crisis to state that sever

Extract of a letter from a Friend, elated
BALTiMORE CouNTY, Feb. 3rd.
"I have this moment returned from a
scene that was truldy harrowing: a human
heing in a state of intoxiction, fell into the
fire, over which he had been seen reclining,
in the absence of the family. and was liter
ally baked!! one of his ears was entirely
burnt oil' : and some other part of his sys
tem was burnt to a cinder, . lie was a
youug man, perhaps about thirty years of
age-an excellent farm hand, but surren
dered himself to the demon of intemperance,
and had thus been cut off in the flower of
manhood, leaving a wife and child, to be
supported, perhaps, by the county.
"I was called upon to. hold an inquest,
which I did, and after the jury was duly
sworn and the witnesses exiunined,-their
verdict % as. that he,(James Spencer) 'came
to his death by intoxication ; in which state
he fell in the fire and was burnt to death.'
Melancholyj Catastrophe-Remarbable f
delity of a 0g.-Mr. Nicholas Ryerson,
a highly respectable citizen of Pa'ckinack,
I'assieo dounty N. ,Jersey, was found on
residence, crushed to death by a tree which
had thlen upon him. lie was out squirrel
hunting. anl when finud it appeared that
he had taken one squirrel and shot another,
whieb in failing lodged upon a tree, which
lie felled, and in falling struck another tree,
whieb caused it to turn rid fall upon him,
bearing haimin to the ground, and cru.hing his
body in a micst herrible tmanner'. fle was
found w ithI thc tree lying upon him, and his
dlog. "the trustiest of its kinad,'' sitting ont
the stumpil of the fllen ~tree. Thle collars.
of Mr. Ryersona's cont and vest wecrc tr
completely o1l' evidently by his faithial
eottantion,. in his vain autt'npts to drawv
his moaster trom tinder thc tree.
We are lnot without hopes that the r'eper
ted destruction of' ta large portiona oh' thle city
of Lexington, K~entiicky, is unfunde.
The conaflagrnaion .is asserted to have occur'
red oni the night of the 25th tilt., w'hereas
we hiave aecounts fromn laltimore and
WVashinagton to theo evening of lie 6th inst.
Now. the r'eguilar mail, we uniderstand, is
but six cdays from Lexington to these cities,
and the express mail is carricd between
those placese in threce days.-and yet no
in formantin of this cat astrophe in anay of
their p~aperts. A pa;tragrarph is indeed pub-1)
lished at New York, of the same paurport
as the act-otiiit receivecd here, ail stated to
be upon the sante niithiurity, viz. the mavor
of the city. But it is not very likely tihat
at sneh a mioment of confusiniand dhist ress,
the Mayor wvould think of sitting down to
write letters to p'er'sons at such distant points
while he omitted to write to others more
immtediately connected w itha the business of'
that city.
In addition to thie, we have sliis fr'omt

The attention of the render is called to the
Prospectusof "The Washington Chronicle-"
which is'to be found in our columns. It
will.be seen that this Paper is designed to
supply the place of the Reformer. It is
now in operation, and we have received a
few numbers. Mr. Cralle is known as a
gentleman of very high talent, and of rare
qualifications vas' an Editor. It requires
but little reflection to perceive the great
importance of having a Press at the Seat
of Government devoted to the defence of
Southern interests; and we sincerely trust
ttat this new enterprize wilf find many hun
tired friends of the true stanp, in this part
of the country.
CONGlESS.
Nothing of very great importance, we
believe, has transpired in this hotly since
our last report. Perhaps the most interest
ing and exciting matter is the charge of cor
ruption brought by "the Spy" against a
member of Congress, which was introduced
to the notice of the !louse by Mr. Wise.
Af:er no little discussion, and a speech from
Mr. Mzathew L. Davis, who is the reputed
"Spy," it was ascertained that the member
implicated is not a member of the House,
but of the Senate, and lir the want of juris
diction, the whole proceeding here dropped.
We are somewhat inclined to agree with
Mr. IBouldin. that if the ]louse undertakes to
investigate all the charges made against its
character, it wili soon have no character to
investigate.
In the Senate Messrs. Webster & Co.
have preseuted some two hunlred Memo
rials and Petitions against Texas and Abo
litiotia. -- - . - -

The King of Prussia has published a

LITERARf CURaonsTY--We have in our
possession the numbers of the Boston Gaz.,
mnore than a century old. One is dated the
27th July 1734; another 24th September
1733; and the third the Git Septenber
1725; the latter bieing 113 years of age..
The two first are ibout the size of a 10 by
12 pane of glass, and the latter one about
12 by 14. which shows the Gazette to have
been on the decline from 1725 to 1734.
There are many curious things in these ve
terans of .. century, and not among the
least is the style in which they are printed
and their odd pihraseology. We find in them
also, several advertisments of negroes for
sale, negroes runaway, &c. which we pub.
lish for the gratifieation of our roaders.

We have passed through two wars, with slave
potimiationt as great in proportion to the whites,
ns it as now, wntont the slightest detriment fromt
it; and if ever the experimnenat shall be nmadaa
again. it will be found that our slaves will be to
us a source of strength, rather than weakness.
