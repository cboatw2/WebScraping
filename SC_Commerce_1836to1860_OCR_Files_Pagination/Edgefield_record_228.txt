In the Senate, to day, the graduation
land bill was discussed by Messrs. Clay of
Alabama, and Young of Illinois, both of
whom were in favor of the bill, andi by Mr.
Crittenden, who is opposed to the measure,
and to any discrimination, in favor of the
people of the new States. Mr. Young de
elared that the new States, as sovereign
ties, would not longer consent to pay tri
bute to the General Government ror their
soil: and, moreover, that it was their right
and duty to take possession of the soil, and
see that it is settled. Now. that is coming
out frankly. The pre-emption laws and
the graduation plan are indirect means of
giving up the public land to the tnew
States. Another census will give them
the wholeof the lands,-n soon as they are
strong enough, they will take the lands by
force, and refuse to pay a cent for them,
Now they take them by force-i. e. with
armies of armed squatters and demand
pre-emption for choice mill seats county
seats, and the richest lands, at the minim
am pice. The next step proposed is to
reduce the minimum tn twenty-five cents
an acre. The next thing to this will be
the demand of an absolute cession of the
lands to the States wherein they lie. It
is an important subject and ought to be set
tied, before the next apportionment-that
is, as far as any legislation of Congress
ani settle it-for, even now, the land laws
are utterly disregarded by the new States.
No question was taken ol the subject and
the debate will be continued to-morrow.
In the House of Representatives, Mr.
Camrbreleng, from the Committee ounWays
and Means, reported a bill making appro
priations for the Civil and Diplomatic ex
ponses of the Government for the year
1839.
Also. a bill to amend the act authorizing
the issue of Treasury notes, (extending
the limitation on a certain amount, to the
80th of June next.)
Mr. Pope, from the same Committee.
reported a bill making appropriations fir
the continuation of the Cumberland Road
in the States of Illinois. Ohio and Indiana.
Some debate followed, on a motion made
by Mr. Pickens. of South-Carolin,, to re
eommit the hill, with instructions to the
Committee not to report it until a majority
of the Committee should concur in so do
ing. Mr. P. stated his reason for this, to
be, that a practice was growing up in the
House, of reporting hills without the assent
of a majority of the Committee-an abuse
which he considered likely to lead to im
r oper mud uuouust tegivinismis. Itsce,rnejd,
owever, that the present bill was reported
by the assent of a majority or a quorun of
the. Committee, although the individual
members of the quorum differed in opinion
upon the bill itself. This being the case.
Mr. P. withdrew his motion. so far as re
garded the instructions, and the hill wals
re-committed; and thus the difficulty twas
disposed u -
The H -,., consented some days since,
to make the bill to post pone the fourth in
stalment of deposite with the States, thre
special order for this day. Mr. Canibre
lang, however, did nor presss it to day,ow
ing to the anxiety expressed in various
quarters of the House. to dispose of the
resolution providing for the appoitntment
of a Select Committee in the case of tlte
Swartwout defalcations. This subject was
then take up, and debased sorme time, but
the House adjourned without taking the
question.
January, 9.
In the Senate, to-day, Mr Prentrs, of~
Vermont, presenuted the joint resolutions
ol the Legislature oif Vermont, instructitng
the Senators, and requesting the Rep
resentatives of that State, in Congress,
to use their efforts to alhohsh slavery in
the District of Coltimbia, and the slave
trade between the States, and tn prevent
the anaexation of Texas. The question
of reception was raised, and Mr. Bayard
moved to lay that question on the table,
which has been the tusual course in regard
to petitions from individuals. Mr. B. sub
sequently withdrew his motion, inasmuch
as the paper enmanuted from a sovereign
I8tate. The paper was received, and Mr,
Prentisui moved its printing. H e tookc oc
easton to say, that the Sotuhern gentle
men, by opposing the reception and prnnt
ing of documents of this chuaractcr were
*tiding the operations of the aborlitiontists
and lie recommended to them to receive
and dispose of the papers itn the utsual form
as the best means of allaying the excite
mnent. He said he would not condescendl
to argue the question whether a Stare htad
a right to present her views on this subject,
but not ask for the considleration of rthe
resolutions. Mr. Calhoun expressed his
tmazement that a man of Mr. Prentiss'
calm and uuimpassioned chtarnerer should
persist in urging this subject upjon thme Sen

of the Union against the other, in this
way to blast the best hopes of rm r'nd. as
they are involved in the perpetui of this
noble Union? The course of the Senator
from Vermont, for whom lie had a hrigh
respect, only served as an illtustration of the
fact, that great popular excitement carries
qaway the strongest minds. Mr. Prentiss
said he did not piropose to agitate the sub

though in the other House,. it bad been
agitated in the most disgraceful mai

The graduation bill was then taken tip.

1u the House of Representatives. Mr,
Bond, of Ohio, was entitled t) the floor,
and proceeded to address the House in a
continued speech ofsome length, the ob
jectof which was to show that there had
been no defect in tie laws as connected
with the recent def.alcatious--but that the
causes of those delalcations were to be
traced to the negligence of the oticers char.
god with the supervision of the financial
adheirs of the Government. The debate
was continued to a late hour.
Among the Executive -omnmunications
laid before the House io-day, was one of
the Secretary of lthe Treasury, (in answer
to a resolution) setting forth the caus'S
why the 'reasury Departmenit could not
expose the recent detalcations. It was
laid on the table, ant' ordered to be printed.

In the Senate, to-day, after some alholi
t ion petit ion- were presented, M r. Robbins,
irom the Committee on the Library, made
a report onl the Snithson bequest,'concit
ding with ajoint resolution for the appoint
ment of a Joinit Commiittee to consider and
report upon the plan proper for carrying
into effect the purposes ol the nmncificent
bequest. Mr.Robiin- spoke at some lengib,
in the eloquent and classical style usual to
hinm, upon tihe subject, taking a view of the
probahle purpofses of the donor andi of the
beneficial results which might he expected
front the priposeed "institution lir tile dif
fusion of knowledge among men."
Mr. Presto,a, who supported Mr. Rob
bins' viewb. spoke briefly. but eloquently,
and took occa-zio to complement the veu
erable and learned Senator fron Rhode
Island, (Mr, R.)
Mr. Robbins is now nearly eighty years
of age, and his articulation is indistinct,
but his mind retains its vigor and his genius
its fire. is language is still energetic, and
hi% imagination vivid.
Of the iany projects in respect to the
dis >osiiion of the Smithson bequest, it is
di1cult to say which will he preferred.
Onte proposition is to eltablish here, at the
Metropolis, an institutitmon fir promoting a
knowledge of Agriculture, which is un
doubtedly the origin and source of all
"knowledge among men."
The graduation land bill was taken up.
and Mr. Clay, of' Ky, spoke at length, in
support of his amendments, one or wshich
proposes a distrihaion of the proceeds of
the sale of the public lands, among all time
Otates. according to their federal numbers,
aftler July, 1840, for fve years, unless war
with a foreign power shall intervene.
Mr. Clay spoke of the great diifficulty and
importance ofsettling this flu.stion in re
gard to the disp)sition ofthe pijblic lands,
mand declared that this its in his judg
"neer, the only imethod ofr efecting the oh

THE RAL ROAD-RIGHT oF WAY.
-'111 TUS COURT OF X116all, DEC. 1838.
The Louisville, Cli
cinnatti and Chur
leston R. R. Com
. vs -Opinion.
John J. Chappell, *RicharJoun Judge.
The Same,
V's,
Dr.- Rees. and Mrs.
Rees.
This Court has weighed the argument,
so well presented on the part of the appel
lants; and appreciates its force.
Thu practical power confided to the Rail
Road Company. by their charter, is great;
and from its very nature, such power
might be abused, or perverted; and land
holder* annoyed, because the route of this
great cominerciam way iq, from necessity,
left to the understanding. skill and discre
tion of the company; and their authority
might be practically eniorced, with too
little consideration for individual justice or
human feelings.
But, for any such abuse of power, the
laws supply ample remedy. An indepen
dentjuty is a retreshing sight and sure re
fuige in every instnee; and is secured by
the charter; and, for continued abuse or
misuse any charter may be repealed.
But when the Legislature have confided
express power, it is not for this Court to
anticipate abuses, and offer to restrain
tietu, when our judicial province might be
hereafter in their supervision and correc
tion. All powers, great and small, may
be made oppres%ive. Yet, still. our neces
sities require them to exist in some tribu
nal.
If the Rail Road route had been given
for a common highway, and surveyors
named to locate its track through the en
tire- State, and contractors hired to construct
tsuch road,with the emolument of toll gates,
provided for compensation. the o!jecitons
ofered would be of similar character to
those iollred in the argument for the pre
sent defendants. Thmere would be no dif
ference in principle or degree.
The true and substantial difficulty felt by
the Court, is in coming to the conclusion,
ih;ot the Rail Road is to he put on the
f4oting and ch:tracter of a highway: and is
erected, toot ftor privale, hat for stuch gener
al purmipses, as to render it an institution
for -,tch public purposes.
Kut, accoording to the view, taken in the
circuit decision. that the application of the
eaymimen domNin of govertment, is, froon
its esential nature, very ;arious; and too
be made, accenting to the suceessive eni
e-ncie-4 or time State. it may he rtiionally
s-"mmed, that Rail Roads, althoughi of ri
cent am igin, have already bectime of incal
collable public importanee; That the en
farited ends andi objects of this gr,-at Rail
K14ad espe-cially. ar fore the transport ation,
and interojre, commercial and social, of
several different States, whose interests
are to be ever regarded, and the anmuinal
c411A1idenee that belongs to such ta work
scredly fiallled
This characteristic is irreeoncileable with
the proper conception of a mere private
way.
Again: Rail Roads have been recogni
zed as highways, in other Srates; with
whmose adjuddications upon great subjects of
commemorce and reciprocal advantage, a ii
heral comity ought to be observed through
out the States; and the same great. objeats
qteadily k'sp i n ve*, b)y all, who value
Rail Roads, as a new moral cement of the
Ainacoin Union, as well as the useful
vehicles of our vast and itirea-aing internal
commerce: anal tht-- uniting in their nati
ral operation, pecuniary profit, with moral
fitmess and the politic establishment of sit
ma!y ineapentent States.
May nt Rail Roads, then he fNirly con
sidered in character andi objects. (anal ours.
more especially)as internati-ol, amId there
fore, public hiebwaya?
With such sentiments, anal for such puzr
poses, we are bounmd to cotnsider the great
endas of our own Rail Road systn, and
to iamauire under their gmuidance, whether
thme e-miinent dlomaitn f govertinent may
neat tairly anal raiionally he applied for its
adviancement it tile very way poinita-d out

In such am instance, we shoul especial
ly require that the charter shall he clearly
unicntitutional before we put it in time
po)wer of any otie freeholder to arrest the
progress of seo great a wuork oef usefulness
aind highm considlerations. It is not enott:rh

S. It belongs to the 'Legislature to decide
whether the public bonefit is'of sufficiene
importance to justify the exercise of the
eminent domain in such cases. 6. And
the'only restriction is, that private proper
ty cannot he taken without full compensa
tion, and in the mode prescribed.
'Thus, then the decision of this court
concurs in every material Yespect, Iith
those of the other American Judicatures,
who have considered the great modern es
tablishment of Rail Roads.' And, is may
be seen, that the manqer of reasoning itn
each court has been drawn from the same
great principles, inherent in and ronsecra
ted by the American Constitution.
Ani thus too, we have increasing evi
dence of our homogenous principles, of
their moral influence, and sure fruits, in the
harmony of opinion, and the consequent
mnion itm action which engender reciprocal
regard, and tend so much to comfirm the
success of so many independent States,
united together by such principles.
The appeal is dismissed on all the grounds
taken.

Resolut ions pa-ssedI by the ILegislature of
North Carolia.
"WVhereas, we bielieve that a great crisis
ias arrivedl in thte poilitieni histoiry of eiur
'itutty, ont the issue aif wihiach we conceive
hte sa fety of our free intstituttioans ti ecpenda:
nid whereais, we c'ontsidler miteotr houndetn
Itiy, as tho Represenitatives of the free
neon of North Carolina, to express in caln
itnd disp)assionaitte lanagua'.ge our opinions
in the great epitestionis which have becen fori
tomne timne, anad some of which are still. agi
.ating the p)ublic mind.
Resoleed. therefore, That this General
Assemblly .lo condetan in the amost dhe
,idedl manner, that act of the Seniame
if the United States, e.rpunging the re
'ords of that body, as a palpable viola
Ion oer of the Constitutiou.

to de'pdbibe e. ireter of the Senate.
-aotlwa, That tons ought to be
pased bilbe dPRi he Ussited States
endemditory of tha'act mud rescinding
the Rikooolutions authorisi'g it to be done.
Resolved, -That this General Assembly
Io consider .the Oub-Treasury system,
which this administration is endeavdflug
to establish, as another item in that series
of .fatal experiments of this and tle.pqst
Adminisatrton which are the main soune
t)f that derangement of the Currency and
prostration of commercial credit, which has
been so severely felt of late in every breach
f industry and which if suffered to become
a law, will, by its tendency to augm6it
E uIve power, to unite the purse and
word in the hands of the Executive,
destroy the credit system, by the ex
, of specie in the Government dues,
change the real ebaracter.ofr
.e .k'eut and place in peril the libbr
iiei of our conttry.
Resolved, That we consider the Public
Lands of the United States, as the coM
tnon property of all the States, and Ilist
we therefore condemn the late act of Con
gress, allowing settlers on the Public Laud
the right of pre-emption at the minimum
price, as an act of gross injustice to theold
States which originally ceded them. or who
contributed a common fund for their pur
chase.
Resolved. That we believe that the most
proper and equitable disposition of the
Public Domain is to divide the proceeds
arising from their sales among the teverat
States of the Union, according to the rati -
of the tederal population.
Resolved. That we do most solemn pro
test against the wasteful extravagance of
the present Administration, and their prof.
ligate expenditire of the public montey;
which not 1nly crpate* a demand for heavy
axation in order to meet the exorbitant
mpproltionsof the General Government,
but w tends to the corruption of the
putlie morals and the degradation of the
national character.
Resolved, That the power and patronage
if the Exeestive Department of the Fed
-ral Goverttmteni have increased to an a
larmiing extent. and ought to be diminished.
Resolred. That our Senators in Con
gress will represent the wisihes of a tmajori
ty of the people of this State, by voting to
:arry out the foregoing rtolations.
Resolced. That the Governor of this
Stat.- he reqested to forward a copy of
these Resolutions to each of our Senators
in Congress. with a reqtent that they lay
hem hel' re the Senae of the U. St6tes.and
me to each of the Governors of the sever
al States of the Union. with a requeqt that
hey lay them before their respective Leg
slatures.

To Correspondents.-We have received
a Communication, signed "Truh," giving
in account of the reneontre '*hich took
lae some time *inee, between Mr. Pom
'ret Terry and Mr. Adam Taylor, and
wvhich resulted in the death of the latter.
[I is in reply to a communication. signed
"Justice," on the -ame subject. which ap
eared in our paper. The statement of

'tbli'.hing any thing more on this subject.
Ite -[ole alTair "ill shortly undergo a
"dicial investiCation. and we wish not to
reite the pubtlic mind. Wte refnse to pub

Inaugural Address of President Lamar.
We htave tade copious extracts to day,
'rom the AdIress of Mirabeau B. Lamar,
o thte Texian Congress. It will be seen
htat he takes strong ground against the an

[t is certainly to be regretted that our Gov
:rnmient did not accede to the proposition,
whmich was made b.s the Texian Minister,
:n form a union between Texas and our
-otnttry. Beside stretngthening our slave
i'siding institumtions, Texas wottld have
proved a p)owerful ally in case of foreign
sar. Separated as she n'ow is, from us,
bhe will eventually become our rival, and
nay prove a formidlable eniemy.
