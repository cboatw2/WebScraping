3? A'he establishment of n steady qnd 4

one of the roost important meaajrcs which
the Adminis ration has sought to prrtnote.
In so laudable and patriotic a purpose, we

the peculiarly, untoward condition of (lie
tim' s, and tlve array of influence, 'interest
and prejudice, against which they hare had
I to contend, in advancing this greiftacasura
we cannot too strongly express our approbation
and encouragement. Every effort
has been used by a vast majority- t>f the
partiz.ins and debtors of nine, hundred Banks
scattered throughout the Union, with tluj
United Slams B ?itk at their fcgt?d, te attri

Pennsylvania and Sooihern' Banks, contra*,
