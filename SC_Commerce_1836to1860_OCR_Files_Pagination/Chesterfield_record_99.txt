YORK, June 22.
FROM SOUTH AMERICA.?By the ship
L?onidas. from Buenos Ay re?, we have late
advices from various parts oi" south Anierici!?
From Peru and Chili, we learn that the hostilities
were still deterred, although there was
little prospect of an amicable adjustment.
Santa Cruz still ad beared to in? project of
incorporating the Republics ot Peru and Bolivia
into one body politic, and constituent
himself ruler thereof, under the title of Protector
; and Chili was still determined to o,?pose
him, seeking for ?hat purpose the aid ot
the Argentine Republic, and that of El Ecuador.
The Chilian syr- dron of ten vessels
was stationed as follows :
Orbegoso brig and Monteaugudo frigate
watching Peru; Congress brig, in Guayaquil
river; Valparaiso corvette and Aquiles
offCallo, (the N a pole an transport had gone
to the latter with provisions;) Santa Cruz
corvette gone to Chileo, to bring men for the
Chili squadjon ; Arequipena brig, at Intermedios,
to intercept Peruvian vessels; Liberated
corvette, titling out at Valparaiso to go
with the expedition; Peruviona Colocolo,
waiting orders at Valparaiso.
An expedition against Peru was in prepation
at Valparaiso. Santa Cru:z had levied
a contribution of ?11)0,000 on the inhabitants
of Lyma. The Chilian Congress had terminated
its session, having granted to the President
extraordinary powers during the war
with Santa Cruz. The latter was anxious
for peace, but would not give up his protectorate.
He had proposed to refer the question
between himself and Chili, to the Charge d'Affaires
of France and the United States, and
the British Consul at Lima, or to either ot
their Governments. This Chili refused. There
were very many in Peru, who only waited
an opportunity to declare and exert themselves
against Santa Cruiz.
From Brazil we learn that the insurgents
were gaining ground in the Rio Grande.
Bento Manuel is said to have joined their
ranks, and it is reported that one of the Imperialist
generals had been defeatrd by the
enemy, The probability is, that Rio Grande
will be severed from the crown of Brazil.

1 iie inaugural iiutm sa vi k>...w. ?,
the new President of New Grencda, contains
nothing worth translating. It abounds with
excellent promises, put forth with such unction
that we are strongly inclined to suspect
their sincerity. He says that lie will maintain
all sorts of freedom, of the press, of religion,
and in short, every thing?that he will
enforce the laws, and obey them himself with
the most perfect obedience?and in short, that
he will be one of the best Presidents that the
wnrld ever saw. One thing Senor Marqucz
declares most unequivocally?that New Grenada's
share of the debt originally contracted
by the Columbian Republic, before its division,
shall be paid to the uttermost farthing; which
wlli be good news on the London Stock Exchange.
Correspondence of the Journal of Commerce.
T TM \ M Mini T>.?The <rreat resources
which a few years of tranquility will (level,
ope in this country, offer the mast fluttering
prospects. The rapid increase of agriculture
leads me to believe, that if we are blessed
with peace for forty years, the balance of trade
will be in favor of Peru, and the road to wealth
be without an obstacle. You will have heard
ere this of the declaration of war by Chili
against this country, and her endeavors to induce
the adjoining republics of Buenos Ayres
and the Ecuador to form a coalition against
us. In this she will undoubtedly he unsuccessful,
and if so, the war will only be on paper,
and Chili will be forced to recede in disgrace.
She cannot cope with Peru alone, as
we have ?a disciplined army of 15,000 men.
The war with Chili, and the high price of
flour m the United States have raised the
price of that article to $*2 a barrel on board,
which is refused for Gallegoe's brand, and holders
are even ashing .$30. A cargo srnt o it
immediately after the new cropm the United
States, would probably pay a large profit.
The funds would be returned in about a year,
from the commencement of the voyage.

TIJ EIIEI R APPARKXT TO TilE THRON E
OF FRANCE.
Tin Duke D'O.leans, eldest son of Louis Philippe,
is shortly to be married to the Princess
Helena, of !\I ecKhmburg-Schwcrin. The discussion
in the Chamber of Deputies, which
lately arose upon a suitable appropriation for the
establishment of the Duke and the dowry of the
Princess, has given some interest to this pro.
posed alliance. We have thought that a short
notice of tho house of Mecklenburg-Sehwcrin
might not be uninteresting.
The Grand Duchy of Mocklenbarg-Schwerin
is bounded on the South and East by Prussia,
on th* West by Hanover and the territory of the
tree Hanseatie town of Lubee, and on the North
by tho B iltic. It Ins an extent of teritory thirty
six leagues in length, by twenty in breadth,
with a soporfices of six hundred and forty six
leagues. It is divided into five departments,
the circle of Mecklenburg; -the principality of
Schwcrin: tho Wendick circle, and tlu? seignories
of Wismar and Rostock. Schwcrin is the
capital of tho Grand Duchy. It is a pretty
it 1 inrmi<hf>d for its in.
TOW n, won r)*jm, ciii'i is ?
dustry and the patronage of letters.
Among tne towns of Mecklenburg. Wii-mar
holds soma importune*. on account of its port
and maralimo commerce. Gustrow is ??istinguished
for its manufactures, and Rostock is the
largest, most populous, and commprci al town of
the Dacliy. It has the privilege of being govern,
ed by its own laws. The usual residence of the
Grand Duke is at Ludwigsburg, in a magnificent
castle, between Rcegnitz and the Elbe. Tiiis
chateau has been termed tho Versailles of Meeklenbnrg.
This Grand Duchy contains about 451,000
inhabitants. Since 1830 a part of its population
his become free. The clonnius of the Prince
comprise about one half of the whole country;
the rest belongs to the nobles and the bourgeois,
who pay two thirds of all the expenses of State.
The predominant religion is Lutheran.
h lie Gran ] Duke exercises, with the states
of the Duchy, the power of making laws and
refrulatin<r imports. Trie revenues of the Duehv
amount to 4,600,003 francs (about $000,000)
and its public debt is 18,000,000 of francs. The
Pjkcs of Mecklenburg, in the former diet of the
Empire, h id five votes in the College of Princes.
They arc now members of the Germanic Confederation,
in which they occupy the forth rank,
with Mecklcnburg-Strelitz. They have two votes
in the General Assemblies, and one in the special
meetings of the Diet. Their contingent to be
furnished to the troops of the confederation is
3,500 men- -ho Gand Duke ofSchwerin is rp.
puted to be one of the richest soverigns of Eu.
rope. The half of all the lands in his Duch)
belongs to his family as a private domain.
The Grand-Ducal family of Mecklenburg has
given seven queens to Russia, England, Den
mark, Poland, and Prussia, and is now ahoul
to furnish a Duchess of Orleans to France. Th<
Princess Helena is sister uterine of Prince Paul
ihe reigning Grand Duko of Mecklenburg.
Prince Patil of Mecklenburg is son in law t<
trie present King of Prussia; nephew of William
King of Holland; brother in law of the presen1
e-uner v of Russia; and cousin of th" rcignir.?

present to him a gold headed cane from the <
wood of the frigate Constitution, in testimony i
of their approbation of his course in Congress, i
and particularly his defence of what they call <
j "the right of free discussion, and the privelege 1
; of petitioning." We copy the following from 1
his reply to the address of the committee which 1
! the reader of whatever party will read with 1
| interest. |!
: With regard to il?*? present situation of j;
l our country, my sentimon's correspond i
j entirely \vi;!? yours. In the midst of the i
bounties of Providence, showered upon us t
with a profusion scarcely ever lavished up- t
j on any o her nation, we are suffering se- j
j verely from causes which I fear we must *
attribute entirely to ourselves. In our j
i relations at tin's time with foreign nations, i
! and most especially with the Indian tribes, <
; we have far more to answer for than to t
.complain of. Our recent Indian War r
! was of our own provokinu, and has been i i
waged in no creditable manner. A nd while ' t
we have wronged our neighbor at the South,! c
[by utterly unjustifiable violations of her it
j territory, unauthorised even by Congress, i (
we are permitting another neighbor at the ' t
; North, to encroach wi;h impunity upon our1 c
. own territory; and to curtail the boundaries . r
| of a State, once pari of our own native j j
, Commonwealth. j <
We present at the present moment a still |
more astonishing and protentous spectacle 1 j
| to the world. Without a dollar of Nation-!
j al debt, wc are in the midst of a National j
! bankruptcy. From a Treasury overflow-1
ingwitli fif.y millions of dollars, our Government
pays in paper trash the wages of
the Clerks in the public offices. The 11
Nation is insolvent?the whole people are 1
insolvent. You enquire if this is owing to y
j the conduct of the late administration. Ij*
j believe it is attributable to various causes, i J
among which the grant of the use of the
monies, in the Treasury, to numerous ,

i Sta'e uurporauons, uy uruer ui mc i.uc (\
i President of the United States, without au. i
| thoritv of law, was tlie most pernicious. ?
, Having said so when the deed was done, I 1
1
j can have no hesitation in repeating it now, '
that its fatal consequences are seen floating
from the wreck of the public credit. The
use of the public monies while in the
Treasury, in "he in'erval between the receipt f
; of lhern as revenue, and the payment of
; them as public expenditures, to fulfil the i
engagements of'the Nation, had been grant- ;
! ed by law, to the Bank of the United Statc>> I'
i for an equivalent. It never had been ofIs
; much profit to that Bank, because the de-!'
-' posites there had never been considerable '
at anyone time. They never were sutler. ,
ed to accumulate; for the moment a surplus ]
appeared it was applied to the discharge of; <
1; the national debt. It was precisely at the J
I moment when the whole debt was paid off, 1
i j and when the revenue was doubled by the
i ' sudden and enormous increase of the pro1
| cecds of the Public Lands, that the use i
1 j of the monies in the Treasury was taken
' j from the Bank of the United State, charterI
ed by, and under the control of Congress ;
, j and dribbled out in parcels to suit favorite
I ; purchasers, foa multitude of State Banks,
without responsible capitals, and wholly
j beyond the control of Congress, or of the <
1 j Executive Government of the United States. J
! j Of the means of information possessed by ]
! the Government, as to their condition and
, credit, you may judge from the recent cir1
cular addressed to them by the Secretary of
' the Treasury, stating that he had learnt
I their stoppage of payment,/row the nacs. ;

! But the ruin of the pecuniary concerns
of the nation, the melancholy reverses of
> fortune, and loss of character among the
wealthy, and the loss of daily bread to the
[ laboring poor and their children, the dist
tress we are witnessing among all classes
of the people, are not owing alone to the ;
> errors cf the administration. There have 11

ushod upon tiicm in a tempest, till it overlowed
their banks, and broke down tlieir

of our race pronounces his lamentation in
tlie Paradise !os'?
'Now I perceive
"Peace to corrupt, no less than War to j
waste.*'
Tito unrestrained pursuit of inordinate I
weal ii, and the abuse of credit, especially j
by the agency of Banks, arc the proximate j
:uuscs of the catastrophe under which we j
ire now laboring. I believe a National j
Bank, chartered by Congress, with a cap- i.
ital sufficient to control all other existing j
Banks, and regulate the currency, to be the {
only practicable expedient for restoring and j
maintaining specie payments; but I enter-1
tain doubts whether it should be a bank of}
discount. With regard to this, my mind i
is not definitively made up. I incline more j

of specie payments by such a Bank, should j
not onl v operate as an immediate forfeiture
of i:s charter, but be a penal offence in the
President and Directors of the Institution.
The violation of moral principle, committed
by a bank, in the suspending specie payments,
is, in my estimation, not interior to
that of fraudulent bankruptcy in an individual.
The right of any Legislature to i
authorise such a suspension is question- |
able, and the repeal of laws expressly enacted
to inforce the fulfilment of contracts,
at the very moment when they have been
broken, is a mockery of all moral principle
and a scandal to human legislation.
But. fellow citizens, 1 indulge the hope
that tie; sufferings of our country, at the
present crisis, arc like the paroxysms or a j
fever, efU ?rts of nature to throw off the dis-1
ease. We have trie J the nostrums of em- i
pirics, and. as usual, they have aggravated J
the worst symptoms of the distemper. I
fear we have not yet reached the last stage
of the pestilence, and that we arc still to he
more severely handled by the Doctor than '
by the Disease.
But the patient has a firm and vigorous
constitution, and he cannot die. After sutfcring
as we must, under the operation of
some other mountebank experiment, upon
:he failure of which those who palm it upon

jfFer another, perhaps the people themselves
will discover that they have been led astray
jpon a wrong track, and will return to the
ight one. This has happened to us more
nore than once heretofore. This calm
ind considerate return of the people, through
heir own sufferings, to justice, temperance
md prosperity, is one of tlie greatest and
jest characteristics of the nation. I; gave
js an excellent Constitution of the United
States, instead of a National Palsy under
lie name of a Confederation . it gave us a
Tiliant and glorious Navy, ins'ead of dry
locks and gun boats. It restored specie
jnyments, after they had been suspended
ilmost universally, and under circumstances
)f a far greater difficulty and danger than
he present. I trust it will restore them
igain. With regard to the present admin,
stration, I cannot have much confidence <
hat, as you sugges', it will profit by the j
irrors of the last. The errors of the last i
idministration, are, in the eyes of the pres. j
?nt, its virtues. The eminent success of i
he substitution ofStates Banks for a Bank |
>f the U. States, has crowned the late ad. i
ninstration with so much glory, that nothing
ess than a hint from the people can ever!
ronvince the present administration it was j
in error. This reform must come trom me j

44 Foul murder hath been done ;
Lo ! here's the proof.4'
A rumor was very generally circulated a- j
aout the city yesterday afternoon, that the I
aodies of two men, who had been murdered, j
.vere found in an old tenement in Holliday - j
;treet, from which the occupants had beer
Iriven by the late innundation, with dark lan- j
:urns, clubs, knives, &c. with which the foul ,
nurder had been accomplished. Multitudes |
ivere attracted to the spot, ourselves amoncr!
the rest, when sure enough, there we found |
the bones of a human being', with the flesh i
apparently lately pealed off; and the scull of j
another, piled up in the centre of a room. In ,

of Philadelphia with subjects for dissection, !
ind had undoubtedly undertaken one on his
awn hook. The tlood, which came near carrying
away his house, washed his skeleton
out of its hiding place, whereupon the
:ry of murder was raised, and the poor fellow
was yesterday arrested, and cast into
prison. Such we believe, are the facts, from
tvhich a tale of bloody murder has been made
up.
NEW-ORLEANS, June 23. !
Since our last publication, dates have been :
received up to the 14th from Vera Cruz, by I
the arrival of the brig Opelousas, from that
port. The principle item of news received
by her, is the suppression of Gen. Moctezuma's
insurrection. lie was defeated and slain
on the ultimo by Gen. Paredes. and the
army utterally routed, which victory in a great :
measure, frees Mexico of Domestic Enemies. [
We would give the message of President
Bustamentc to the Mexican Congress, but
for its great length, besides, it contains little
to interest the Amerihan reader, being principally
taken up with a review of the corruptions
which have been engendered by the unsettled
state of things, since the freeing of j
the country, with assurances that every tiling j
will be done to correct the evil. There is lit- i
tie in the document relative to Texas, but the
little it contains, should prove a warning to
that State to prepare in time for the battle.
They have at length got a man to oppose
them, who knows how to speak modestly of
his own merits, and when such are to be delt
with, there is nothing like being prepared in
time for the worst.

St. Louis, June 10.
Mr. Webster arrived yesterday afternoon.
Of the manner of his reception in this city, it
is scarcely necessary to speak. The dense
throng which filled our wide wharf?the repeated
cheers which arose i'rora the multitude
on every side?the feeling so evident in almost
every countenance?were exhibitions of respect
and admiration for the talents of this
upright statesman, which could uot be mistaken.
The bills of the Columbus and Insurance
Banks of this city, are in great demand in Augusta.
We notice in the Chronicle, that a
uremium is offered for them by rcspecta
ble houses. Thank yon. gentlemen, for the
compliment; but we opine that our folks in
this quarter, don't care to sell their Columbus
bills even for a premium, unless you can pay
them the shiners, and perhaps if these were
right plenty with you, you would not care so
much for Bills that would draw them*?Columbus

The Prusian government has lately issued
an ordinance to dismiss from office every functionary
who shall be seen intoxicated.
Seduction and Murder.?The Indianian, published
at Charleston, Indianna. states that an
individual named Cole, formerly a resident of
that county, succeeded in obtaining a promise
from a young girl, whose parents lived
near New Lexington, in that State, to elope
with him. They proceeded on their way to
Vernon, where he became very much intoxicated,
and seating himself and his victim on
a log by way side, he deliberately drew a knife
from his bosom, and plunged it into her breast.
With one scream, that brought the neighbors
to the spot, she expired. The murderer instantly
fled.
The Governor, at the instance of several
benevolent persons of Hudson, has commuted

buildings and burnt them to the ground ; and
also burnt considerable of his fence, leaving

particulars. We think the foregoing, however,
is enough.?Fredonia Censor.
A Prophet in Limbo.?The Mormon prophet
Jo Smith, has lately been arrested in
Geauga county, as accessary to an attempt to
murder an unbeliever in his golden humbug.
It seems Jo had a revelation that a certain
sceptick in the neighborhood of the 44 Holy
Land" deserved martrydom, and soon found
a couple of his followers stupid and wicked
enough to obey his ministrations. Thev were
foiled in their attempt to shoot the individual;

during the past year, have been 822,000;
for foreign missions, ?26,000.
The Board unanimously resolved, that it is
expedient to have a Missionary Bishop for foreign
parts appointed ; and that the stations
of said Bishop should be Africa.

the salvation of many souls, and to the gradual
overthrow of the system of supersition

augmented by a little exertion. To any person
desirous of embarking in tho business it oners
inducements not inferior to any in this State, but
to a practical Printer, they know of no investment
he could make of his money that would
yield him a more profitable return.
