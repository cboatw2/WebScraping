from its rarity, should be the more valued.
Much has been said lately in Congress
and out of it, by the press and by corres.
pondents of the press of a cabal at Wash.
tngton that was endeavoring to excite
difficulties between the President and his
cabinet. Tho names of certain members
of Congress have been mentioned as connected
with this cabal. We have given
little heed to these imputations; for we
have doubted whether the President would
lend his ear to irresponsible counsellors,
and least of all to such counsellors as some
whose name* are reported. The recent
movements indicate at least, if they do
not demonstrate, that a cabal of a different
composition has been tampering?not

ministers, and has at length compelled
them to resign. There is no longer any
doubt that the question of a National
Rank is the question on which a formidable
opposition to the President is about
to he organized, and that Messrs. Ewirig,
Badger, Bell, and Crittenden, threw up
their offices in a tit of ill humor, because
the President is opposed to such an institution.
We have long been aware that
*0 certain quarters, a man's opinions in

character of a Whig; but it was not till

cabinet officers reached us, that wc supposed
tlie line was to be so soon and so
* distinctly drawn.
The Xcic York Herald is the paper in
which the confidential transactions of
President Tyler's Cahinet, and the purpones
of the President himself in regard to
the hank bills, while the bills were still in
- bin hands, were first given to the public.
The paper is certainly one of the basest
and most unscrupulous in the country.
We copy from it the following brief para,
graphs, as specimens of its style.
Thesecond veto message of the glorious
and resolute "Captain Tyler," which

perhaps than the circumstance war*

MThe truth is, the connexion hetxveen

the most humiliating and disgraceful occurrence
that has ever yet darkened the
history of our government; an occurrence
that no respectable American citiV

for the degradation of his countiv ; and if
it were not for the palpable proof, it would

' tW"
Tea President and the X. Y. Herald.
The following extract from a letter to
the Baltimore Patriot throws some light
* or the connection of the President with
this vile sheet.
. How long Mr. Webster will continue
in power, is not known, and cannot be
foreseen. He and the President are on
good terms. The President seems very
anxious to have him stay. * *
I fear, however. Mr. Webster cannot long
continue in office from the extraordinary
and malign influences about the President
just now, which laugh at the idea of his
staying in office, and threaten that in six*
. ly days he shall go out. These influences
are novel and curious. The New York
Herald People here, to which Mr. Ewing
allude*, have captivated and bewitched
Mr. Tyler's family. There have been,
you may have remarked during the extra
aasion, gatherings of ladies and gentle'
men in the President's Square, at the
Capitol, twice a week, to hear music, drc.
In the accounts the Herald has given of
these scenes, Mr. Tyler's two sons have
been extolled to the skies, for their talents,
their personal appearance, &c. dec.,
while the truly agreeable and interesting
daughter of the President has been held
. . up as a Princess?and she is one, they
who know her own, in her mild and lady
III'- or>/4 ririi/Unno ortrl Java
J|*C u^pvl iiiiviik) p? uuviav^ duvi uvt va
>- lion of character. The sons, however,
do not stand flattery so well, but have be*
come perfectly charmed here with the per*
son that gives so interesting an account
. ??f their personal appearances and abilities.
One of them is the Private Secretary of
his father, has the reading and copying
of all his papers. This intimacy discloses
rfo you how it is that the Herald, four days
. "before the last veto message, had t!)p sub*
ntanceef it in its correspondence. Prpb*
-nbly ** the writer of the letter froij^ Washington,"
read it from the President's own
private letter. The President, himself,
MC*&not be aw?re of tiud assoc^tiop jbflj*
ence, I am sure, and when he sees it no.
ticed in the public press, will soon correct
it. Thus, tf?o, u the veto message" was
out in the Herald before it was given to
Congress, which was certainly a high affront
to the Cabinet, who never knew any
thing of it till they bought it in the street.
These influences, that thus surround the
President, say Mr. Webster shall not stay,
while the President himself wishes him fo
continue. Let me not be undesfood as
intending any attack upon the President
in all this, for I am sure he will correct
these evils, as report says they exist, the
moment the public press brings them to
his notice.

to acquaint you that Her Majesty has

of reporting to your advice and assistance
after the dissolution of the last Par.

* Her. Majesty continues to receive
from foreign powers gratifying assurances
of thfcir desire to maintain with her Majesty
the rwwt friendly relations.
u Her Majesty has the satisfaction of infunning
you that the objects for which
the treaty, of the 15th of July, 1840, was
concluded, between Her Majesty, the
Einperor of Austria, the King of Prussia,
the Emperor of Russia, and the Sultan,
have been fully accomplished ; and it is
gratifying to Her Majesty to be enabled
to state that the "temporary separation
which the measures taken in execution of
that treaty created between the contrac.
| ting parties aod France has now ceased.
" Her Majesty trusts that the union of
the principal powers upon all matters af.
fee ting the great interests of Europe will
afford a firm security for the maintenance
of peace.

Her Majesty has ordered Her Minister to
the Court of Persia to return to Teheran.
** Her Majesty regrets that the negociations
between Her Plenipotentiaries in
China and the Chinese Government have
not yet been brought to a satisfactory
conclusion, and that it has been necessary
to call into action the forces which Her
Majesty has sent to the China seas; but
Her Majesty still trusts that the Emperor
of China will see the justice of the demands
which Her Majesty's Plenipoten.
tiaries have been instructed to make.
M Her Majesty is happy to inform you,
that the differences which had arisen be.
tween Spain and Portugal, about the ex.
ecution of a treaty concluded by those
_ - nor r
rowers in iooo, iur rcgummig
gation of the Douro, have been adjusted
amicably and with honor to both parties,
by the aid of her Majesty's mediation.
M The debt incurred by the Legislature
of Upper Canada for the purposes of pub.
lie works is a serious obstaclo to further
improvements, which are essential to the
prosperity of the United province. Her
Majesty has authorized the Governor
General to make a communication on the
subject to the Council and Assembly of
Canada. Her Majesty will direct the
papers to be laid before you, and trusts
that your earnest attention will be direc.
ted to matters so materially adecting the
weltare of Canada and the strength of
the empire.

your loyajity and zeal to make adequate
provisioq for the publie service, as well
as for the further application of sums
granted by fne last Parliament.
M My lords and Gentleman,
41 We are more especially commanded
to declare to you, that the extraordinary'
expenses which the events in Canada,
and the Mediterranean have occasioned!
and the necessity of maintaining 4 force
adequate to the protection of our exten
1 1 ' ! I " ' ','! 1 ? '
?ive possessions, have made it necessary I
. to consider the means of incf-ensiftg the 1
puhijc revenue. i
" Her Majesty is anxious that thisob- t
ject should be effected in the manner least j
burdensome to her people; and it has appeared
to Her Majesty, after full delibera* <
tion, that you may at this juncture ptoper- i
ly direct your attention to the revision of 1
duties affecting the productions of foreign i
countries. It will be for you to consider c
whether some of these duties are not so <
trifling in amount as to be unproductive t
to the revenue, while they are vexatious (
to commerce. You may further examine ?
whether the principle of protection, upon <
which others of these duties are founded, t
i be not curried to an extent injurions alike r
to the income of the state and the interests t
of the people. I
"Her Majesty is desirous that you i
should consider the laws which regulate ]
the trade in corn. It will be for yoti to (
determine whether these laws do not ag- i
gravAte the natural fluctuations of supply; t
urh.ith*>r th??v dn not embarrass trade, de- (
?; ?
range t he currency, and by their operation <
diminish the comfort, and increase the <
privations of the great body of the corn- I
inunrty, . * " ' )
44 Her Majesty feeling the deepest aym*. \
pathy with those of her subjects who are i
uow suffering from distr&s and want of {
employment, it is her earnest prdyer that i
all your deliberations.may be guided by I
wisdom, and may conduce to the bappi^ <

which was merely an echo of tho speechr I
was moved by Earl Spencer, to which an 1
amendment was proposed by the Earl of i
Ripon, to the following effect: (
44 Humbly to represent.to Her Majesty.
that we observe with great concern that :
the public expenditure has of late in each I
of several successive years exceeded the I
annual income, and that we are convinced <
of the necessity of adopting measures for I
the purpose of remedying so great an evil. <
To assure Hei Majesty that we are deeply I
sensible of the importance of (bote con* I
siderations, to which Her Majesty has t
been graciously pleased to direct our at- ,
tention, in reference to the commerce |
and revenuo of the country, and to the 1
laws which regulate the trade in corn.-? i
That in deciding the course which it may i
be advisable to pursue with reference to i
such matters, it will be our earnest desire i

That we feel it, however, to be our du- I

CASE OF M'LEOD.
1 . r
In the House of Commons, on the <
28th. August, Mr. Roebuck put several. <
questions to Lord Palinerston, Secretary I
of State for Foreign Affairs, as to what 1
had passed between the British Govern. !
ment and the Government of .the .United 1
States in relation to the ca9e of Alexan* 1
der McLeod ; Whereupon . ? ? '
Lord Palmerston . rose and said, he (
should be the Ia9t man in that house who: (
xvixialif intnrnnap h?ftirui>h. nr who wnulH
curtail any information which might ?%, ^
given on any subject; but he at the same
time felt bound to remarkt that The procee- j
dings of the Hon. member for Bath werq (
somewhat irregular ; because he was sura
the House would be ofopioiori/ifquestion#!'
upon matters of the greatest difficulty and*
delicacy were to be prefaced' by Hon.
members with a sort of narrative, It be.
' a i
came extremely difficult for the individual - j
whose duty it might be to answer the
questions to refrain from going at length |
, into the subject to which those questions ^
related, and thus, under the form of asking (
a question, a debate might be brought on
without notice upon a matter of the grea.'!
' test national importance.) Hear, hear:) 1
( However, he (Lord Palmerston) should be
happy to give the Hon. and learned mem. .
ber for Bath the information he asked,
and he had no douht the statement he was
about (q make would tend to relieve the
mint}8 jof many persons yhp might think |
' tfyajt the present state of the question with (
regard to Mr. M'L^od was likely 0 bring ,
on a serious difference between the two
countries, fv? qarratjye of thi? HjOh? j
and learned gept|eipan was, be. believed,
substantially correct, and qpon it be (Lord J
Palmerston) had no particular remark to f
make, ft was quite true, as the Hqp*
and learned gentleman had stated, that J
upon the first demand made by Hey lfaj.es- .
ty's Government for the liberation of Afr* J.
M'Leod an answer had been returned by ^
the late Secretary of State of the United c
States which was by no meant satisfacto. g
ry, and he (Lord Palmerston] was quite
ready to admit at a doctrine of ^hrternat'1 j
tional law that no one country had a right
mmi | \* i'
~ .
to state in reply to a demand for tedrew
for a wrong done either to anotner country
or to the subject of another country,
that it had peculiar institutions within it*
<elf. [Hear.] >
Nations with each other as aggregate
communities?they knew knothing of the
nternal institutions of each other; if a
prong w'ere done, redress must be given
ind if the laws and constitution of the
country did not enable it to give that re*
Iress, that nation must alter its laws or
lubmit to the alternative which in such a
case became necessary. [Cheers] Now,
ilthough the first reply of the American
Government had been, as he thought, en*
irely wrong, as to the principle of inter*
lational law?although he had considered
hat reply to he unsatisfactory?yet he
lad now the satisfaction of being able to
nforra the hon. and learned member for
3ath and the House, that from the present
Government of the United States a com*
nunication had been received, containing
i formal instruction given to the Attorney
General of the United States, with refer?nce
to this question, which contained
loctrines just and consistent with the
! % ftr# hf n.ilinnu on/1 ?i ?r in ononrr] I
'* " " OMU I III VIVVWIUince
with" the principles upon which her
Majesty's Government had demanded the
'elease and liberation of Mr. M'Leod.
Hear, hear.] The paragraph which he
ihonld read from those instructions would, I
le believed, answer more than two of the
piestioni.-which had been put to him by
the horn and learned member for Bath,
for it would show that Her Majesty's G jv.
jrnmont had avowed its responsibility for
heat tack made upon the Caroline, and
;ha{ the American Government treated
the affair as one to bo dealt with between
the two Governments and totally unconnected
with the question affecting Mr.
JfLeed. [Hear, hear.]
Tilts instruction, which was dated the
16th of March in the present year, was
from Mr. Webster, the Secretary of State, |
to Mr. Crittenden, the Attorney .General
>f the United States, who was then about
to proceed to New York on the business
if the state. It recited in the first place
the grounds upon which Mr. M'Leod had
been arrested, and then proceeded to
itate?141 have now to inform yon, that
Mr. Fox had addressed a note to this department,
under date of the 12th inat. in
which, under the immediate instruction
ind direction of his Government, ho demends,
formally and officially, M'Leod's
immediate release, on the ground that the
transaction on account of which ho has
been arrested and is to be put upon his
trial was of a public character, planned
and executed by persons duly empowered
by Her Majesty's colonial authorities to
take any steps and to do any acts which
might be necessary for the deference of
Her Majesty's territories and for the protection
of Her Majesty's subjects, and that
consequently those subjects of Her Majesty
who engaged in that transaction were
performing an act of public duty, for
which they cannot be personally and individually
answerable to the laws and tri- ]
hunals of any foreign country ; and that
Her1 Majesty's Government has further
directed Mr Fox to make known to the
Government ofthe United State*, that
Her Majesty'* Government entirely ap.
prove* of the course pursued by Mr. Fox,
and the language adopted by him in the
correspondence above mentioned."
[Cheers.]
Mr. Webster then went on to say?
llT(iere is now. therefore, an authentic
declaration on that part of the British
Government, the the attack on the Car.
dine.eras an act of public force, done by
military men under the orders of their su>
pcriors, and is recognized as such by the
Queen's government. The importance
of this declaration is not to be doubted,
and the President is of opinion that it calls
upon him for the performance of a high
duty. That an individual forming part
?f a public.force, and acting under au.
thority of his government, is not to be
field liable as a private trespasser, or male,
factor, is a principle of the public law,
sanctioned by the usage* of all civilized
nations, and which the Government of
the United States has. no inclination to
dispute. This.has no connexion what,
ever with the question whether in this
SHte the attack on the Caroline was, as j
the britisk government think it, a justifiable
employment of force for the purpose
if defending the British territoryfrom unprovoked
attack, or whether it was a most
injustifiaBle invasion, in time peace, of the
teriritory Of* the United States as this
government has regarded it. The two
piestionsare essentially different, and,
while acknowledging that an .individual
i?ay caliji. immunity.from the consequen.
:es of acts done by him, by showing that
ie acted under. national authority, this
government is not to be understood as
changing the opinion which it has heretofore
expressed in regard to the real nature
if the transaction which resulted in the
'extraction of fhe Caroline. The subject
not necessary for any purpose connected
with the communication of dWMSSt
Ail that is intended to be said at present j
s that since the attack on the Caroline
s avowed as a natioual act, which may
ustifv reprisals or even general war, if
he government of the United States in
the judgmeut which it shall form of the
transaction and of its own duty should see
if Oft fft An*'.,la i, rnittAM a Question

sntircly public and political?a question

ndivjduals concerned in it cannot be ar.

violation of municipal law. If the
iltackupon the Caroline was unjustifialie,
as this government has aHserted, the
9W which has been violated is the law
if ngtjnns: and the redress which is to
lesoqgbt is the redress authorized in such
ases by the provisions of that code. You
re well aware that the President has no
firniqal, courts of the state of New York,
f this indictment were pending in one of
r,; -.7^? -4fe . J??.''** . 1
the United States, I am directed to say
that the president upon the recept of Mr.
Fox's last communication would have immedintly
directed a nolle prosequi to be
entered." [Loud Cheers.] Now. nothing
could be more honorable to the Govern,
ment of the United State?, or more satis
factory to that of this country, than this
declaration of principle. [Cheers.]
He thought he had now answered all
the questions put to him by the' hon. and
learned member for Bath except one?
namely, whether the United States had
made a demand upon this country for injuries
done to the United States at large/
and not for State of New.York especially, j
Unquestionably the first demand had
made on that ground, and in the course L
of the last session he Lord Paimerston
nad staled that fact as a ground for his opinion,
that impossible the United States could
turn round, and say it was a question between
Great Britain and one State only. (Hear, '
hear.) The constitution ot the United Slates j
placed all these matters in the hands of the j
Federal Government, and the tenth section
of the first article o/ their Constitution provided
that?1"No State shall enter into any
treaty, alliance or confederation, or grant let.
ters of marque and reprisal. No State shall
without consent of Congress lay any duty of
tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time
of peace, enter into an argieeinent or compact
with another State, or with a foreign
power, or engage in w-r, unless actually in.
vaded, insucii an imminent as will not admit
the delay." (Hear, hear.) Therefore, it
was perfectly true that this question"c>uld no
more be said to be between Great Britain
and the State of New York than (if America
had felt herself aggrieved by Great Britain)
it could be said that the question was hetflveen
America and the county of Rutland. [Hear.]
But the Hon. and learned member for Bath
had on a former evening suggested, that Her
Majesty's Government ought, on the outset of
this affair, to have sent out a special envoy to
the authorities in the State of New York.
Now, he [Lord Paimerston] was of opinion
that such a proceeding would have amounted
to a nullification or denial on the part of Great
Britain nf the fundamental Drincioles of the
constitution of the United States, and that
they would have treated it as an affront upou
the Federal Government. (Hear, hoar.)?
Therefore, it was not from neglect on the part
of Her Mageaty's Government that the course
had not been taken?on the coatarary, it had
been avoided out of the respect thoy
were bound to pay to the co nstitution of tin?
United States. (Hear, hear.) He (Lord
Palinerston) trusted he had now given an answer
to the questionput to him. tie should be
sorry to antiripatethecourse which the Govern
ment of the United States mignt think proper
to follow, in order to carry out the principles
of international law: and he thought the
object of rhe Hon. and learned gentleman
would be best answered if he (Lord Paluierston
abstained from entering further into the
matter. (Cheers)
