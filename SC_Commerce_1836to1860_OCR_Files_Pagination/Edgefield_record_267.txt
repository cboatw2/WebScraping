Relief to Coton.-The New York Jour
nal of Commerce of the 7th inwt. .ays:
"Circulars have been sent on by Bevan
& Humphreys of Philadelphia. oleriltl
an advance it 1-2 cents per pound onl all
Cotton forwnled to the House of II im
phreys & Biddle, witi the igreement th.it
the Cotton shall he held until lie de-pre
sion is over. They reconitend that the
banks in ihe various sections of the Cot ton
country, should assist the holders to make
out the dillirence between their advance
and the cost. Agets hac heen sent out

States Banuk is the back bone of ihc pro
posiion.
From the Correspondcnce of the Augusta Con.
NEw YORK. June R, 3 P. M.
The week now closing has been one of
much depression. Money stocks have
fallen. The banks have curtailed their
discounts. And so money has become
more difficult toobtain. and the feeling a
mong the holders of Cotton w;ts h-comaiit
more and more anxions, and prices were
gradually yielding until the decline of the
,week was something like 14 ceuts per 11.
Yesterdav, however a circular was distri
buted by S. V. S. Wilder and Mr. Rock
,well, gentlemen who have taken a l:trge
share in the great cotton moventeuts of
the last two years; acting as has been sup
posed iu concurrence with the U. States
Bank. This circular I need not re peat. as
several of them were sent of' by yester
day's mail to the South. and must hP in
your place. The effect of the circular
here. has been to give a certain degree of
confidence to the holders of cotton. They
think there is certainty somewhere, and
so are more firm in refusiig to yield fur
ther in prices.
Money stocks have cnnsideralily revived
to-day, owing at least in part totthe circu
lar. Our merchants are much divided t
opiniot as to the ilicy and thimate use
fulness of the movement. If it should
he carried out into the next crop, as issua
gested, the movement wouldi he a ver%
dangerous one, for prices are such thtt to
take the Cotton crop of 1839 by the fore
lock. will be a different bilsiness from do
ing the same thing with the crop of '36.
Upon the whole, people are not rid of it eir
anxiety except in part. The sales of cot
ton for the week are 1500 hales; Upland,
124 a 154 cets. Flour has rllen to $6
.50 a $7-for all sorts. Corn 92 a 94 ets.
Wheat is dull, and only 140 cents or there
abouts could be oltvained

The Cottcn llarket.-An im portant cit
cular, addressed to platers concternied itt
the cotton trade; made its alppearanice yes
terday, and created tno stma~ll oe::ree of~
sensation. The uinfavorable news or the
cotton market brougtt by the Gr at West
ern, has had a severe eil'eet upon the moit
ney market, and it is assumed that the
depressioni of prtce has been produceed ini
England by a powerfuil and dhetermiinedh
combination amtong thte tmanufnterurers of
Manchester and elsewhere to force the ar
ticle down atid keep) it dlownt.
Hence a project is breachedl in the eir
enlar to monopolize all the cotton remain
ing in this coutntry of t he last year's , rop.
and to keep it back from the Englishi mar
ket until a large profit price catn he coim
mranided by the American holders.
As the circutlar appears anonymously,
we know niothittg of its origin. Sotme of
the morning paper-s say thatt it has been is
sued by the agent of lluimphireys & Biddle*,
while by others it was regarded a- h
productioni of a pet-son hiavi ng no nnthornty
to act for the htouse mentione-d, andir as is
sued with a view of inidutcini hilhers in
the U. States to holdl on to) their Smecks
until lie can dispose of w hiat lie nowv hs
ini Liverpool,.atnd ott its way thi:her, at
somethinrg like present prtices.
Int eithier case, we are etntirely- opposed
to the proposition. Undler existing~ cir
cumnstanices, it inighit. for the ttme h !e
inig, work advanutagteously for the couui
try. But at best, it is hut atn elfoit to
circumvenlt one set of montoptilists by ano
ther. It is a schemno entirely at war with
the pritnciples of free trade, and fair itidi
vidual competition. anid with wvhatever
temporary benefit it taty he attetnded, ul
timate evil wvilt surely be the result of~
such combinations.
Correspondencc of the North American,.'
Nmcw Yoazc; June 10.
The grand topic of discussion is s'ill thie
colton circular. I should juidge that a mtt'
jority of our merchants are pretty decided
Jy opposed to the policy. Cotton is to day
rather droopitng again, some fe w sales have
been made at prices whtich were tefusedl
on Friday and Saturday. Flour is very
tmuch at a stand, only smatll sales are mta
king at $6 2.5 for Orleatis, $6 :37 fbr~ Ohi,
and $6 62 a 75 for Gennessee.
U. S. Bank shares sod to day at the
Brokers board at 12J., and afterwat'ls at
122. The cause is said to he that mnost of the
floating stock has beetn retmitted toEn
land, so that little remains in market, and
some parties who have beeni selltng fhr
future delivery, Giud themselves obliged to
bid high to get hold of it..

South Sea E2rploring E.xpedition.-Lieu
enant Charles Wilkes. comlimanding the
exploriig E pedilion, under date of IFeh.
7th. 1839, has written a letter in the See
etary of ithe Navy. The Squadron nr
rrived at Orange Harboi, Terra Del Feu
:o, the place of rendezvous, on ihe 19th
ildimo. The erew was in good heahih.
The Anti-klasonic Convention which
issembled at Harrisburg, Penn.. on the
!5th of May. nominated Gen. Harri.on
4r the P'esidcncy, and Daniel Webster
hr the Vice Presidency.
It-appears from a resolution passed by
hat body, that these gentlemen have ac
epted the nominiaion.
Reuben Al. Whitney.-It is stated in
everal papers, that this notorious nan,
vlon the Raleigh Star, a Whiig paper,
alls "infamous," is, or was very recently,
he efficient editor of the .ladisonian, an
knii Administration, Anti-Sub-Treasury
Maper. published at Washington city.
Phe Star says "We do not know that Mr.
Vhitney is certainly a Whig. We do not
now, nor do we care what he is. Hie is
'ne thing to-day, and another to-morrow."
Let this man is considered by niny, an
racle-the expounder of true Whig princi
es. Hi6 editorials have been copied in
1 un1mterous # . hie liapers. He was once
ii Administration mai. htut now fights for
is e.nemies, and the etemies ofthe Consti
utional Treastury. If ie does not coutend
ir principle, lie at least lights for plunder
nd f'Or pay.
H'hig Sub- Treasurers.-Under this cap
ion, we fidil the lhllowinm in the Old Do
inion. "The Viekihnrg Whig states that
lie notes Of the Decatur Bank are quoted
I one dollar per peck. What an excellent
epository for the public funds!"
We will add, what a comforimble "Half
vay House" nonuld the Brandon (Missi<
ipii) Bank make flor the Government trio
cy, in its Iravels!
Popularity of Mr. 1FIse.-At the recent
lection for Congress, in Virginia, Mr. W.
eceived in one County, in his District. 166
of es, ott of 168. Truly, lie ean say like
nother public man. once said, "I have the
est constituents in the world."
The Old Dominion -nys -Mr. Tafli, a
rierchant in Savm.nah, has in his posses
ion 20,000 ant og ahlis, original hand wri.
ing of listingnished men." if these au
)graphs hbe as obscure as those of great
ten geterallv, it wiold puzzle a French
s'avant, to tell "the author. of them "
The same paper says, "Miss Shtireff,
he vi'Ilist, is about to lbe mairried to a
ew York Lawypr. lHe has presed his
wit, and is ahotit to gain his cause." The
uttornmey is welcomie to her. We saw it
tate~d sery recently, what this ly in en
eting a very imtpassionedl part, was so ear
ed away by a torrent of feeling as to go
"side herself, and shriek in agony on the
'age. The scene was represented as ap
allinig. Wha' rational man wants a hys
rrical woman, for the pairtter of his bosomt?
We have read the Report of the Comn
littec of Twent.3-one, who were appoint
dI ly the late Commtercial Convention, to
usider and report on. the measures ptroper
lihe wrdoptedl by that body. The Report
very full, andi satisfactory, and contains
mei(h va.lutable inufortmation, which weI
onld with pleasure, transfer to onr col
mnns, did our limits pernit. WVe will how
ver notice a few thinugs. The Commnittee
untmerate tmany causes, which bro'ught
hitt the prentu depressed state oif Sonth
rn Commetce; hut they say, that "these
ave now mi a great meastire, cE~AsED TO
xisT, and that the opp~ortunaity is presen
-dl of improving our present advantages
f renmoving themi altogethter--andl regain
tg all that we have lost. In a little mobre
wan two years, the tariff' will be reduced
t he "tevennme standard," based on "an
conomicmdaltdministratin of the Federal
lovertnment." We shall soon be relieved
'nm a system, which has sapped the very
mundation, of our. prosperity, and reduced
s almost to a state of "colonial vassal
ge." For the rest, we tmust depend upon
uruelves." On the subject of imporwa
otn into the city of Charleston, the Com
iittee say,
"For several years prior- to, anid includ
tg the year J807, the imlports' into the
ty of Charleston, estimating their a
tount by the duties receivedl a' the Gustomj
nuse,-(then average rate of duties b'eing
icen about 12& per cent.) amouted, on an
v~erage, to about nine millions of dollars
nnually. Frotm that pteriodt, under the
peration of the 'restrictive system,' the
nportations, (with the excepti n of three
ears, front 1815 to 1818, inittoedtelv
fter the peace) gradually declined until
riSo. Itn that year the imports had fallen
one million. But from that time, and
specially since the 'Anmericano System,.'
as received a fatal blowv, and thie Govern
ient has commtientedl retracing its steps
auck to the 'lFree Tradet System,' our itt
orts has e beena steuddl3 increasing, so
mt they now amitountt to about three
millions of dollars, and if we shall go on
iuiproving, "ill soon reach their former
amuount."
This is indeed cheering, and should in
cite our. merchants, and wealthy planters,
to greater ellort to bring about the restora-.
tion ot Southern trade. The objection
that has been too frequently made to the
hculhilutuest, of Charlestou, the Commit
lee entirel3 remove. They say,
"W ith the single exception of the yellow
or siranger's lever (whicit setojm n'akes
its appearauce ait the Souib o-tener than
once itt four or five years, aid fron which
the cities ol the N'rth are not entirely ex
eupt) we are actually subjected to iewer
taun pitdeimes, than ''utr north,-rn breth
ren. The balls of mortality of the difl'
ferent cities of the Ut.ion, will show%. that
the general health of our cities, is at least
as good as that of the cities of the North.
Consumption alone destroys a greater
number of lives in the cities of the North
in proportion to their population, than are
lost in Charleston and Savannah, from
yellow fever and consumption combined,
deducting from the latter, the number or
strangers who come here in the liit
stages of the disease for the restoration of
their health."
To oring about the revival of our trade,
the Commimte recommend to our Plan
ters, to set apart a portion of their annual
surplus, and inlest it in commerce. They.
think that this would fie a better jvest
ment, than applying it to the usual pur
pose of making more cotton. They recom
mend the formation of Limited Copartner
ships, by which means every one has the
opportunity of investing so much of his.
capital as he may think proper, in com
mnercial pursuits, ithour incurring a risk
of losing in any event, more than the a
mount so invested.
They say, that Credit may, to.a great
extent, be made to supply the place of'
capital, for the pi4rposes of the proposed
trade. It is this, which has in agreat de
gree, built up New York, and "bhas fur
nished the merchants of that city, with by
far the greater portion of their available
rneans,hy which theyhave been able tonp
nopolize .o large a portion of the South
ern trade." They say, that foreign capi
talisq should he induced to establish A
gencies, aud to form Copartnerships among
us, for carrying on the direct trade; they
should be brotght to unite with us, inthe
establishment of regular lines of Packet
Ships and Steamers, to arrive at stated
periods at our principal ports-and the
work is done. To effect this, they assert
that nothing more is necessary, than to
give capitalists in Europe, the requisite in
formation and they will then have confi
dence in introducing any amonnt'of capital
ihat may he desired into our Southern sea
ports
In the proposed revival of trade, the
Conrmit tee pive great proasiaenee to-In
ternal Improvements. They say,
"Equal in importance to the creation of
such a capital for carrying on the direct
irade, is the. irnishing A AT ARKET for all
the goods that can be imported.-indeed it
may he assumed as indispensable to our
success. tlat R ail RoadsCanals and Ttrn
pike., mttst furnish the great channels of
com munientin, through which -thlie good's
brought itnto our ports. must find their way
to the cotnsutmers in the interior."
There are other things in the report,
wvhich w.e wotuld notice. hut out limits for
hid. The Report of the Committee of
Teza. is also f'ull nnd satisfactory. We will
not now attempt to condense it, but will
shortly lnav berore otur readers, some inter
esting extracts from it.
The Washington Globe contradicts the
statement that Licut. E. W. Moore~of tho
U. S. Navy, had taketn command of the
Texian Navy.
The Augusta Chronicle & Sentinel of
the 13th inst., says "W~e are requested to
say, that the Hamburc Bank, as drawing
at sight otn Charleston, at half, and on
N..York, at 2 per cent. for Augusta hills."

By T HE EDt ToR..
SLFEP A ND HOPE.
When fatigued by the toils of the dlay, the
laboturer directs his steps to his abode,
Sweet Sleep, 'tis thou whom he in
vokes! Attentive .1o his prayer, thou
comest to close his eyes, and makest
himt forger the fatigue of watching.
Loaded with thy benefits, he goes to re
pose, and to dream but or happiness.
Ho goes to see himasolf surrotunded by
his childrea, who stretching forth their
arms towards him, ask of him a kiss,
and tell him that they are happy. When
-he looks abroad, he sees the fields which
he has cultivated, and covered willithe
grain so necessary to his existence;
every thing anndunces to him an abun
dant harvest.. To thee, he owes .his
pleasures. Why mttst awvaking displaceo.
thee, and cause to flee away, the illu
siens which thou hast made ! Who will
console~him? Hope- 'Tis she who sus
tains the unfortunate, and who strength
etns hum to support his troubles. With
her, his toils are less grievous; if he
complain, she points to him the recom
pense; if he be disquieted, she cones to
tranquillize htim. Ahlways gay, aways
conrent, the labourer drives his plough,
without perceiving the hardness of the
soil which lhe tills. The sweat which
bedews his brow, does not stay him a
moment; every things tells himt of Hope;
this alone sustaitns his courage, in the
furrow which he has inust phoughed. hc
