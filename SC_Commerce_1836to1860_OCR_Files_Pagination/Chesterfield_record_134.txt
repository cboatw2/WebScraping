A CAMP MEETING SCENE.
Wc overact the fo!{owing graphic descriptiou
of a camp meeting incident from
. the Knickerbocker. How finely, it will be !
si-en, the preacher took advantage of the i
leaping of die fawn into the enclosure oftiic '
j cainp ground, as a shelter from the pursuit,
\ of the widf, and \vit!? what beau y, carncs -;
% ness and i .-oquencv, be seizeAopon that in- J
\ cident to warn'suiners to 4 flee to the fold <
* . i of God.'
* Disembarking at Cincinnati, I set off i
f on foot to e.\ptcn*e iho cavern of Kentucky j
andJVirginiu. Travelling Inter one eveningj
J than usual, 1 lost my way iir the midst o;:
: M ' one of those extensive forests, winch still ]
$ skirt some of those western cities. After
wandering about for some time, on tinning j
u precipitous ridge which obstructed my |
course; I came suddenly upon one of!
these sibgular*gathpnngs of the cfuirch m:K J
ttuit, called camp meetings. .Colore me4
stre.ched a grove of tail pines-beneath J
whose dark foliage, and'iastriking contrast;
.v with the same, pitched numerous whiits tents' i
embracing a level area of several acres in !
ex en-, entirely, devoid of underbrush, and i
carpeted with the falling tresses of rhcover- ;
hanging boughs. On one side of thisencio
sure, several feet from the ground .1 plain !
lodire. ouadrangulary formed* of rough !
': o . i v _
boards nailed to the trees with the pulpit in
front, aud benches around the sides, for the !
c * * eiders and the ministers who wero'to ad- j
dress ihd congregation: From this spot to j
various points in the enclosure, stretched in 1
d:verging lines, the straight poles of Jof.v
pin s, fdiixl for the occasion, across whose j
I prostrate length, with the interspace df here :
and there'a long drawn aisle/ were, laid,
* the rude seats of those.hardy worshippers, j
Innumerable ldmps.wcre suspended on all i
sides of the encampment, blending their;
* flickering light with the glare of pine torch- I
es from the severed tents, where the evening's
repast was in preparatibn, while mil- !
lions- of tire flies shot like ipiy meteorsalong
the dark openings of the surrounding !
forests, and the eyes of the sleepless stars j
- looked on* as il to wknesrthe devotions of i
thf?t primeval temple.
As 1 paused to survey the wonderful i
scene, the wild iiowl of a wolf rang- through j
the shuddering air, and a moment after a
fl'.iwn passed mc> and bdunJing into trie en- j.
closure, droppd down exhausted in one!
of the open aisles. This ?singular ini
stance was succeeded by u dead "silence,
which was presently interrupted by the!
voice of the speaker,, who had .just .fin-'
isiied the last discourse of the evening, and i
was about reading the concluding hymn*? ;
? . o
4 Welcome,* said the aged man, with compassionate
emotion,4 welcome, poor, wea-!
ricd and persecuted wanderer, to the refuge |
and rest ye seek not here in vain ! , Ye did
well ttf flee* hither from thy ravenous pursu- j

auditory, 4shali the beasts tliHt perish be wi

wild pigeon shrinks to her covert at the i

I not, or heed not the voice of the prowler.
Wot ye not that yevhke that poor pant g 1

wilderness* of the world. Flee to the fuid ,

footsteps from the rising of the sun to the j

- flee to the fold of God, wherein ye shall \
find a refuge and a rest.'.
Vain were the attempts to depict the
W- scene which followed the peroration. 7'hc j
sighs and groans, the sobs, the hysteric ,
shrjeks of the terrified females, and indeed ,
the convulsive shudder of the whole asscm.
b!y, 1 leave to the reader's imagination?
or, memory it he has ever witnessed a spectacle
so thrilling. A f r the first bust o:
feeling had a little subsided, the tre iiuVjs
L yet not unmusical voice of the late speaker
was heard chanting that striking hymn: !
\ 4 Stop, poor sinner, stop and tli!nk>
Before you farther go;
* Will you sport upon the brink . - |
Of everlasting wo ?
M One listener after another joined in the;
strain,- tili pres? ntly ten thousand voices
% were blended in the swelling symphony.
I have listened to the midnight peal of trie ,
roused ocean and trembled amid the tiiun- j
dering of the Niagara, but never was my
heart hushed to breathicssness, as by the
living chorus of that solemn anthem. The

even on a mind the most obdurate, I sunk
down on my bended knees, awe-struck t&d
overpowered. It seemed to me that every
voice was directed to m\ self, in eager
imprecation to fly from the brink of the
dreadful abyss to which 'hope never conies
to all.' The services closed with the hymn,
the worshippers slowly retired to their respective
tents, and silence and sleep resumed
their quiet empire; but there I remain-ed,
jivetted to the earth, motionless, and**
alone. Ye net alone, for the voice of a

TRX DYING BLD~OT AMOTflER. \i
Of nil the relations on earth, none are j c
more sacred than that of a mother. If any i
person this side of heaven, lias claims to su- ! <
perior attention* it is an affectionate, pious, 11
aged, helpless, suffering, dying, mother, j'
Sixteen days my mother hud been suffering | I
keen distress of body. With the exception i i
of o:ie? short interview, I had been absent;! (
but now called to gaze upon her dying foa- j e
tures. I liad ever thought that 1 could com- j J
mand my feelings oiwmy emergency what-1 s
ever, but their gushing tide now overwhelmed
me. Others told me that she was tr-\t
umphantly waning for ti e chariot to take t
im% home.; but I wished to hear ti e -.ver c
testimony from her own lips. Again and v
again I went to her bed side, look her hand .:
in mkne, with a full resolution to inquire con. i
iorning Iwr faith and hope ; kit as often did
lie.swelling tide stop my utterance?the;
scenes of infancy all came up in review, and
hey seemed as it were but Yesterday. Her i
sprightly step, her once blooming features,
iicr soothing voice sfcemcd present before, j
me, renewed in youililulness and vigor.
The iiand so often outstretched to save me
in the years cf childhood, was now growings
cold?-the eye that oilce sparkled with
rapture at m)fcinfantile sports, already half
closed?the lips that first told me who made
me, "and* taught me to say " Oar Father,
who art in heaven,5' were about to be scaled
forever in death?those imp csscd upon
the feelings in a measure, which 1 shall nott
attempt to describe. ()nee more'I stood by
her bed side and with flattering voice, in.
quired : " Mother, hate you still unshaken
faith in God ?" But the tinilling name'
of mother vibrated no longer upon her cap ;
she answered no more by words or signs.
Alas, J kissed the clay-cold hand, and exclaimed,

BELIEVER IN CONTRAST.
The celebrated William TyndaJ, who be;an
to be persecuted lor his freedom of renark
in testimony to the truth, in the com.
nencement of the reformation by Luther,
vns led !o consult a certain divine, who had
jcen chancellor to a bishop. The divine
old him confidentially tha^ in his opinion,
lie Rope was antichrist, but advised him by.
10 means to avow any sentiment of the kind,
is k would he at the peril of his life. . Tynla),
however, soon proved himself incapable
>f concealment, tor being in company with
i popish' divine, he argued so conclusively
n favor of a vernacular translation of the
jible,that'the divine, unable to answer him,
unclaimed, " We had better be without I
tod's laws than the none's."- This tired 1
. I ~ I - ho
spirit of I j-nclal, and with holy indignaion
he replied, * I defy the: Pope and all

From the Luthern Observer.
TO PI ,US YOUNG MEN.
I much doubt whether many of these
poungmcn havecvcr even agitated the quesion
whether ilrey are cailcd of God to enjago.
in this great business. Many, especially
tlio$e who live in more remote
places, where the-publications of the 'Education,
Missionary, and other Societies are
o a very limited c.^fcmt circulated, have, it
is to be feared, but little knowledge of the'
moral dearth of our land and 'world. Or,
f they have suoh knpvvleege, the subject is
so seldom presented.to their minds with lite
force it deserves, or with refercnoe 19 personal
duty, that hut comparatively little impression
is produced.- Such can hardiv be
expected to inqOirc whether they ought to
?nter'the ministry. My friend, who are
rou, now reading these lines ? Are you
pne of the pious young men belonging to
he American churches ? Though you may
be included iu the number who ought to
preach the (?ospe!, you may have various
?.?~ r~.. .
rcaauua mji y. uiJLKium^ mui yuu ?u? uui. j
Let us examine these reasons.
1. You say you cannot enter theminisry
because you have not the means to ol>a
n an education. But have you applied,
hrough your pastor, <3r otherwise, for assistance
from any Society or Board of Edu:ation
? If not, can you continue to urge;
lie want of means as an excuse ?
2. "You urge that you have not the requisite
qal{filiations. Let me inquire what
jualiticationsyou do need. Want of piety 1
io to the foot of the cross, and lie there,
ill you obtain it. As, however you may
orm too low an estimate of vonr piety, you
:annot confide solely in your < Un judgment
n this matter "and consequently are under
ibligaiionsto ask the opinion of judicious
Wends. Jdo you urge want of talents ?
This may be a legitimate pica ; b it it has
)een urged by some of the -most eminent
nen which.the world lias produced. 'When
doc! required the services 6f Moses, how
earnest was lie in argument for declining?
ieremiara said," Ah, Lord God, I cannot
;peak, for I am a child."
3. !>c you say " I do not feel that I have
ica/'io the ministry ? If 1 could ascerain
that I had one, I would enter on a
:ourse of preparation." But is there no
ia7 to ascertain this ? It appears to*me
het . . - Consider the momentous beards
ol^^^oucsiion of duty. . You allaw
i that you are bound to do all the good and
prevent a!i thecvi! you can in die world. By
i entering the ministry with the aid of the
i Holy spirit you may be instrumental in
| convening many of your feilow-njen ; in
raiding up preachers of the Gospel; and in
jioing much good in various other* ways.
If you do not enter it. you leave the fieid to
he tilled with the naiyrul and rapid growth
of errors in doctrine and practice, which
will soon amount to little less than heathon!
ism. . Go to God in humble and-importunate
prayer.for cTirection ; follow the indications
of his Providence and the guidance
of his spirit; take?counse! of his-ministers :
be willing to go wljere duty calls : and if
you seriously believe that you can glorify
| Gobi more by preparing for the ministry,
! and lliere be no valid reasons against it ;
tliOii it appears to mo that you arc. to wait
Tor no oflier ca!!; and wo.be to you if,
through your own criminal neglect^ you
preach not the gospel.
To those of you. beloved brethren, who
*
have such .a belief, 1 will mention some of
the- motives which should constrain you to
engage in this work ; *
1. Your obligation to your Saviour
should move you. lie has enrolled your
name in heaven, and prepared a place for
you at his right hand, where you are to
drink forever of the streams which make
glad the city ofyour God. O had you a
thousand lives to spend in the service *of this
ado'rable Being, oi* had you ten thousand
tongues to sound abroad his praisef you
should dedicate all to hfm who has doticso
much for you.
2. Your obligations to your neighbor.
Him, you are commanded to love as 'your self.?Thousands
of v b\\? .feltov/.men, who
j are a!i your neighborsrarc perishing. The'
soul of every one of these has been pronounced
by him who has the ksys'of 'death and
I hell, to. he of more value titan the whole
wdYld. - This thought alone ought to be
'sufficient to make you rejoice to leave your
farm," or your merchandize, %or the law, or
medicine, and fiy to the help of any one
who can possibly be rescued from so tremendous
a doom.
3. Consistency of conduct. On ' your j
knees, at the throac of grace, you plead with !
your Saviour to send morednborcrsinio the
hareest. How can you spread forth your
hands, while you are unwilling to do your
part towards the advancement of his king- I
dom and keep back a pan of the price ?
4. The rewards which await you, if found
faithful. "The who turn many to righ- |
reousness shdll shine as the stars for ever j
and ever/' Wimt joy shall thrill through !
' " ? .1
your bosom, in seeing tnenonor wmui muswhom
you arc instrumentals, in saving, will
bring to vour Redeemer. \ ou shall never
forget, that every soul which is saved will,
through some period ofetcrnity, bring more
glory to this adorable Being than yet has
been brought by all the myriads who Ixive.
gone to heaven.
In consideration of what lias been said, I
have two questions to ask, answers to which
I solemnly enjoin it upon You to give to the
Head of tire church.
. Do you intend to go up to the help of the
Lord in tin's mighty work ? If so whatsoever
your hands find to do, do i; with your
might. . * * .
Are you disposed to 'decline entering the
ministry, or are you halting between two opinions
? But are you prepared to resist the
calls wuich .arc made upon you ? .1 entreat
you to thing welhofthis matter- before
you ccmc to a determination in the negative.
As an embassador of the King of Heaven,
I charge.you to make those calls at subject
of much prayer and meditation. Lot the j
first ques'ion on your self examinaVrt list,
for morning, be, Am I going to glorify my
Saviour to day by not setting my face towards
the Christian ministry ??And let your
first question oh your self-examination list,
for evening, be, Have I glorified, Hod today
in not setting my face towards the n in:
istry ??While engaged on your farm, or in
vnnr shorn or in vour law or medicine, ofion
/ i"V
put ihn question to your conscience, Do 1-bc.
Jicvc my God looks down upon me with as ,
much approbation*us lie would i? I were
now engaged in laboring in the vineyard of
his Son ?
Can you qnitely stand still and sec multitudes
perish i Have \ou no bowels of
pity ? I lav? you no sentiments of compassion
? ?Have you no tender concern for
your perishing fellow-men ? If you havcf L
beseech you to show it, by flying to their
help. How will your very knees smite together
with trembling, when you see them
pointing out their hands towards you in the
presence of (lie assembled universe, and
liear them saying, " There stand the men
who solemnly convenanted,' over the body
and blood of their Lord, that .they woujd
love their neighbor as themselves ; but they
loved us nol?though they knew what evil
was corning on us forever, they pitied us
nol?" How will your hearts die within you,
.when you hear your Saviour say, Is this the
way you have shown your gratitude to ?.Iej 1
who shed my blood for you ?

'l'lie objects to be secured by such a Convener..
are to ascertain what has beeh done in this

iroui.ition to tlie Bible; what facts may be colictcd,
which will throw light upon our yet re
laining destitutions; whether it i$ expedient, to
ngagc simultaneously in rcsupplying the State '
:ith the Word of Life upon a plan sinriler to
[vat which was agreed upon in Columbia, several *
cdrs ego; and it so, by what means .and by what
gancies the plan can bo most fully and thorughty,
and jcdiciously carried into effect} so * *
