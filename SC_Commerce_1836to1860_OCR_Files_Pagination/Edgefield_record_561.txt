When this is the case, it may be grazed
the second and third years, or if desired, a

root, of Chesterfield, never wained a cob,
bit considered it capital-feed. I took some
pains to discover his mode of using them.
It is as follows; Whenever he shells corn
or mill, the cobs are thrown 'into a half
hogshead of. salt and waier. to which his
cows tave acess. By te time he sends
to mill again, there is plenty of room for
more-cobs. I have tried this plan with
gre.tsuccess. The cobs are hardly soak'
ed by the silt water. before they are eager
ly devoured by my, cattle. I would as
soon think of throwing away my fodder as
my corn cobs. Yours, A. R. S.
We have understood, upon inquiry, that
Col. Burfoot now boils his cobs, instead
of soaking them. He breaks them wih an
axe, and throws them into his feed kettle,
and we ore assured that there is no por
tion of its contents that are preferred to these
bits of corn cob.
These plans are no doubt both good;

the bill was such as the former

n the 'Senate this morning, Mr. Cal
:laun presented a copy of the proceedings
of the Republicans of Amelia County,
Virginia. reprobating in strong language,
the measures of the present Session of
Congress. After the transaction of some
unimportant business, the Bank bill was
taken up, and Mr. Archer spoke for two
long hours. About one third or his re
marks was devoted to denunciations of the
octrine of nullification, and that he, him
self, was par exrcellence. the champion of
Stata Rights principlcs: another third to
proving that the Fiscality in its present
shape was perfectly constitttonall, though
in its furmer shape it was entire'y uncon
stitutional. To crente an institution with
the power of discounting promissory notes,
ws a gross usurpationi, dangerous, if not
fatal in its tendency to ou fre institutions;
but to create an institution with power to
discont bills of exchange drawtn in New
York, on Jersey City, or in Philadelphia,
on Camden, n the oppogite side of the
Delaware, was a muni6cienit exereise of
expressly delegated power, and wvas abso
lutely necessar'y to the pr'eserv'ation of the
Republic. No one, he said would deny
that Government had the right to parchase
a bill of exchanige if it was necessary for
the transmtission of funds to a distant par
tion of the country, If it could buy A bill
for a thousarnd dollars, it could for a million.
If it enuld authorize the head of a De
part meat, or en individual, to purchase this
bill, it could authorize two or more indi
viduals under the form of a corporation to
do so; and, ifthey could authorize tis in
stitton tO o deal in exchanges at all, they
could authorize it to deal in the exchan
ges of the whole country. The remain
ing portion of his speechb was an eflhrt to
show that Mr. Tyler could not consistent
with hisiexpressed opinions, veto this bill;
hat the doctrine oftrequiring the assent of
the StatesP was a super absurdity, so far
above comprehentsion that the $enator
from South Carolina, (Mr. Calhoun) who
was. perhaps the most astute man in the
United States could not follow.
Mr. Buchanan briefly, but most triumph
antly replied to the arguments of' Messrs.
Archer and Berrien in favor of the kite
glying hscalityand contrasted some of their
arguments with their pretensloos as es
ponders of State Rights doctrines. The
power of Governmient to purchase a hill of
exchange when it was necessay, (said Mr.
Archr) gave Congress the power to cre
... a Bank of twenty millions, to deal in
the exchanges of the whole country, and
to establish agencies in every State of the
Union against their wishes. This was one
specimen of strict construction. The Sea
ator from Georgia (Mr. Berrien) yesterday
contended that the power to regulate com
merce, gave Congress the power to create
a paper currency with which to carry on
that commerce. This was another speci
men of strict construction. He then an
alyzed the fiscality, and demonstrated that
it was infinitely more objectionable than
the former bill, and if John Tyler should
sign this bill, after taking the high and ele
vated ground he bad done, in the veto mes
sage, he would eternally disgrace himself.
He remarked in conclusion, that the Whigs
had been condemned for much of what they
had done at the present Session, but they
had done one thing for which they deser.
ved the thanks of every lover of liberty
throughout the world, and that was, they
had most effiectually done for themselves.
This brought up Mr. Clay of Kentucky.
and the manner in which he commenced.
led every one present to expect an erup.
tion, nor were they disappointed. Mr.
Buchanan, in reply to a remark of Mr.
Archer, that he was better acquainted with
what was going on at the White House
than he (Mr. A.) was, playfully replied
that he was not now, but hoped he soon
would be. Mr. Clay took up this remark,
and supposed it possible, and on this suppo
sition poured out a torrent of denunciation
on the head of John Tyler, in which the
vocabulary of invective was exhausted,
and conclusively established the reputation
of the Speaker as the greatest rhetorical
blackguard of the age. The desertion of
his political friends by the President, (said
Mr. C.) would he an act worse than trea
sou, an act of moral turpitude, which had
never been equalled in any age or country;
he would be execrable, atrocious, infa.
mous, and would Irender his name loath
some in history; but, he thought this de
sertion of his friends and his principles by
the President to be uuerly impossible-the
soil of Virginia was too pure to produce
such a traitor. The discussion was furth.
er continued by Messrs. Buchanan, Walk
er. King, Wright, Linn, Calhoun and
Preston. Mr. Calhoun in allusion to some
remark by Mr. Clay, as to his visits to the
White House, remarked that he had had
no communication with the President for
the last two mouths, but lie would take
occasion tosay that he most heartily
iproved of the late veto; and that he

anhiely worse than the former would

were used on the one side to deter the

flatteries and promises used on the other
to induce him to perpetrate the act. le
fore he had concludedlhis remarks. he for
got the object for which he said he had risen,
and fell into the same strain of argument
which he had rebuked at the commence
ment of his speech. Mr. Calhoun replied
that there were various ways !of making
known their opinions in the President-one
was by confidential intercourse] with the
ccupantof the White House, the other
was fur a Senator to state them in his
place, in the Senate Chamber. It was a
mere o,,ntter of inste between him and the
Senator from Virginia, and he, (Mr. C.)
preferred the latter mnode. Several efforts
wer6t now made to get a vote on the en
grossment of the bill, but Mr, Berrien in
sisted on havinig an opportunity of answer
ing the argument of Mr. Buchanan, and
moved ati adljnnnmwent. The Democra:ic
Senamoms expressed their willingness to
hear him then, but he persisted in his mo
tion, which was carried by the WVhig mna
and the Senate adjoturned.
The Ilonse debated for an hour on the
McLeod resolution, then talked another
hour on varions resolutions which were
offered by members, and then adjourned.

The Bank Bill (or rather Fiscal Cor
poraion) is taken up to-day in the Senate.
But little will be said concerning it. It
will go in the President. and if in its pre
setit shape, will nssuredty be vetoed-and
then follows a dissolution of the Cabinet.
It is understood that the President wilt
sign the Land Distribution Bill. If so,
the Democrats Cannot take office under

things occur, there is a end to his preten

WAsatsoroN, Sept. 3.
In Senate, this morning, Mr. Calhoun
presented the proceedings of a large mee
ting of Republicans of Clarke County,
Virginia, which expressed iin stronge hut
decorous language their disapprobation
of the measures of the present session of
Congress. and reviewed the promises and
pledges of the Whig party during the re
cenit Presidential canvass, which are still
unredeemed, 'Ihey also warmly appro
ved of the reent Veto of the President.
Mr. C. moved that they might be read
and ordered to be printed- The proceed
ings were read, and the question being on
ordering them to he printed.
Mr. Preston, (who merely acted "Char
ley." for the occasion,) opposed the mo
tion to print, on the ground thatthey were
disrespectful to the dominant party in the
Senate, and mov# .z~at they be laid upon
the table. This. otion preluding all re
pt. Mr f''alhane, aske hatm it mipht be
withdrawn, which, aft: some hestisks
Mr. P. acceded to.
Mr. Calhoun said, be held it to be aa
inherent right of tbe people to mak-ta
solves beard in the halls of eegislato.,'e
all occasions on questions in which thy
are interested, when their opinions are as
pressed in decorous language; and be
would challenge a comparison between
the language oflhese proceedings and the
whieb Senators were in the daily ahitof
using in that chamber: it was far wore&
corous than was used by Senators on t
other sideyesterday. Were they to pre
acribe a rule to the people of this countr.
a rule which they 'bemselfes were in the
daily habit of violating T He trused the
motion to lay on the table would not pre
vail.
Mr. Preston then renewed his motion to
lay on the table, without rising from his
seat, and Mr. Benton proceeding to ad
dress the Senate, he was called to order by
Mr. P., but he was informed that having
made his motion while sitting in his seat.
it was unparliamentary, and passed for
nothing. 1he Chairsusiained thIs opilon,
and Mr. Benton reprobated in atog
terms this attempt to stifle the voice ofthe
freemen of this country, but the attempt
would be utterly futile.
Mr. Preston then commented at mach
length on the proceedings, reading extracts
therefrom, (which amused the Senate a
good deal from the home truths it contain
ed.) and fastened particularly on a remark
that the majority bad been pressing their
measures with "indecent haste." He ap
pealed to the Senate with much gravity, to
say if "indecent" was a decent word. He
then renewed his motion to lay on the ta
ble, and Mr. Calhoun requested him to
withdraw it for the purpose of replying to
some of his remarks, but he refused, and
the motion to lay on the table was carried
by a strict party vote.
Mr. Benton then informed the Senators
on the opposite side, that he had a docu
ment ofsimilar tenor, from another c'oun
ty in Virginia, which he would present to
morrow, and as they would find its lan
guage at least as objectionable as the one
just on the table, he would take care to
make his remarks on it before they got the
opportunity of applying the gag by laying
it on the table.
The Botis' Bank bill was now taken up,
and Mr. Simmons of Rhode Island, and
Mr. Berrien addressed the Senate in its fa
vor. The latter gentleman, in his usual
prolix and tiresome manner, spoke for
about an hour and a half in reply to Mr.
Buchanan, aud man a toevadtbthree
argument to p -
late commene
power of creating paper to carry
on commerce-a doctrinew bh Henry
Clay, a few years since, when it was ad
vanced by Mr. Webster, most solemnly
repudiated. When he had oncluded, the
question was taken on ordering the bill to
a third reading, and it was carried-eyes
27, noes 22-Mr. Rives voting against the
bill, and Messrs. Bayard and Williams
haviug paired off. The bill was then pas
sed, and Mr. Clay expressing a wish to
postpone taking up the tariff bill until to
morrow, the Senate adjourned.
In the House nothing of importance was
done, and it adjourned about 12 o'clock.
The Distributing bill has been signed
by the President. Some of the whigs be
gan to fear that it would be returned with
a veto. The country would have had
gread reason to rejoice had such been the
result, and would have triumphantly &us
tained the veto and its author despite the
denunciations of the Great Dejected &ed
his partisans.
WVAsie-ozs, Sept. 4.
In the Senate this morning, a hill fronr
the Honse mnaking an appropriation of
8600,000 for naval stores ad ordinance
was taken up, and after some discussion,
Mr. Allen moved an amendment providing
slat the mon~ey should be taken from the
proceeds of the Public Land,. The
amendment was lost, and the furtherecw
sideration of the bill post poned ntil Morn
dy7.
The Tarift bill was theu takeO up, andW
Mr. Clay went into his long delayed ex
pose of the condition of the Treasry.
The defich in she Treasury at the close of
the year being the difference between the
current revenue nd ibe current expendi'
ture, will he silteen millions of dollars.
The amount of appropriations, including
the unexpended balatrees for the present
year will be 830,616.560, and the actual
expenditures of she year 828,500,000
Thbis is about seteu millions ofdotlatsmmer
than were expended last year, and 'a the
full6ilment of the promise of refrenchment
in expenditure. Mr. Clay said if the tax
es on tea and coffee were taken off it would
inevitably produce a necessity of ralsing
the other duties above 20 per cent. thus vo
lating the compromise act, which he hoped
might be preserved inviolate if the duties
were retained on these articles. Mr. Car

to Mr. Clay. He commenced with mttch
severity on the delay in making known the
deplorable condition of the Treasury until
it was announced that the PIesident had
signed a bill diverting a large end impor
tant branch of the public revenue firom its
legitimate purposes. Ho asked the Sena
