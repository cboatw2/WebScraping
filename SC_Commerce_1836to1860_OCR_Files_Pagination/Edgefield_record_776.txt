When Mr. Eld. who, it will be remem

rres thb matter, arrived in that city. he
sacertaincd tiat he saeg had never

Breedlove, I have not learned. It is suffi
ient to know that, after examination, the
trio stood committed, and were yesterday
banded over to thie officers, with accom
mdated thmem with metal ornaments not
easily broken. snd set off to day for the

bout this afamir, and,. with their usual
learsighaed zeal, the papers in opposition
so the admzinistration have endeavored to
eclie od ing ag::iat the secrezaiy or the
treasury lby styling his refusal to pay the
notes repudiation. This is all sheer non
sense, end, let the trial be madte when it
may, it will be found that Mr. Spooler is
fully sneasinsed by the law in the ectirse
