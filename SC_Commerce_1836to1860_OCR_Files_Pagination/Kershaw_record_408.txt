Moffat's Life Pills. _
THESE medicines are indebted for
their name to their manifest and sensible
action in purifying the springs and chan
nels of life, and enduing them with rcnewed
lone and vigor. In many hundred
certified cases which have been made pub- 1
lie, and in almost every species of disease tj;s
to which the human frame is liable, the j
happy effects of MOFFAT'S LIFE ' ,,
PILLS AND PHENIX BITTERS have ,
been gratefully and publicly acknowledged
by the persons benefitted, and who ILs
were previously unacquainted with the f
beautifully philosophical principles upon I c:
which they are compounded, and upon 1
which they consequently act.
The LIFE MEDICINES recommend Am
tliomsplvns in diseases of every dcscrip
iion. Their first operation is to loosen Am
from the coats of the stomach anil bowels,
the various * impurities and crudities constantly
settling around them; and to re- ^
move the hardened ficces which collect in ,t.
the convolution of the small intestines. *'* ^
Other medicines only partially cleanse
these, and leave such collected masses be- Old
hind as to produce habitual costivcness, ;
with nil its train of evils, or sudden diar- He
rhcca, with its imminent dangers. This 1
fact is well known to all regular anatomists,
who examine the human bowels 'TI)
after death ; and hence the prejudice of
these well informed men against quack f?oc
medicines, or medicines prepared and heralded
to the public by ignorant persons.
The second effect of the Life Medicines is ''
to cleanse the kidqeys and the bladder,
and by this means, the liver and the lungs,
the healthful action of which entirely depends
upon the regularity of the urinary -^"1
organs. The blood, which takes its jed i
color from the agency of the liver and the s;ic
luqgs before it passes into the hearl, be- <
' - - 1 1 1
ing thus purihcil l>y tt?cm, ami nounsueu
by food coining from a clean stomach,
courses freely through the veins, renews
every part of the system, and triumphantly
mounts the banner of hcaJtii in the blooming
cheek. on ti

All that Mr. Moffat requires of his pa- j fort I
lients is to be particular in taking the (Jj
Life Medicines strictly according to the t|ic
directions. It is not by a newspaper no- num]
tier, or by any thing that lie himself may ^ <
say in their favor, that he hopes to gain peejjr
cr* '!it. It is alone by the results of a fair ,
trial. For sale by J. R. McKAlN.

Security against the Wheat fly.?When t
icre is an abundance of clover or hemp
round a wheat field, it has been ascertaind
to a certainty, that very much less injuf
will be done to the wheat by the grain
ics than in most other situations. The
jason is plain. The weevil deposits its
ggs on the sweetest plants it can find,
ad prefers the clover or hemp even to
heal.
