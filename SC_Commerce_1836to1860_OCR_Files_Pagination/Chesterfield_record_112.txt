heen heard of, I will endeavor, as far as I j n
can, to discribe the machine, and explain i C
the manner ol using it. i p
The machine consists of a very strong j d
pair of wheels, say 19 feet diameter; the fl
axis is about 15 or 10 inches diameter.? s
Net u- to, and the inside of one of the wheels, I li
? third wlicel, something less than the others, i j;
?> famed on the axis as a hub. A large j \
rope hawser, is fastened to the periphery r
of the small wheel and coils upon it. To r
the end of this hawser arc hitched lour oxen i <_
*?a large chain is made to fasten to the j i
centre of the axis round the stu nj>. The ! |
oxen drawing upon the hawser, turn the i t
small wheel and ax:s, while ihc two large c
wheels remain stationary, only supporting <
the operation. Tim stump when thus e.\- 1 <
TraeteJ is borne off. swinging under the ax:s,: i
to the hue whe.e tlic fence is to be made. '!
It may be necessary to add that where ;;
the stump is large and holds a strong grasp ; i
upon the earth, the most prominent lop ! I
roots should be cut off .*3 or i feet from '
~ 1
rue siuuip. , .
TI?o fence is constructed by throwing the ..
s.mnps into line, and stopping in here and j
there a root to secure the widest openings. J
To those acquainted with the durability of.
pine stumps, it is iiardiy necessary to oh- ;
servo that the fence constructed of them ,
will remain sound lor at least one generation.
i
The machine constructed as above and
applied by four men and four oxen will ex- ;
tract from 70 to 80 stumps'per day. Its use
fulness needs no comment. There is nothing <
visionary about it. The experiment lias
been tried upon a large scale, and many a
farmer who heretofore dreaded the pine j
stump as an enemy which would survive i,
himself and annoy his heirs, now swings j
his undisturbed scythe or cradle over the j
strong ground which his (alien foe once ;
occupied.?Centrcvi/le Times.

East India 8Cotton.?There annears to i
m t ' 4 I
be a great increase in tiic growth and im- >
port of cotton from oi.r East India posses- j
sions during the last year. Up to the 17 h
of December 1833, the import of East India
cotton in'o the kingdom, was 111,140,;
v h 1st up to the 17t:i of December 1830,
no less than 222.535, bags were imported; i
I
the increase, therefore, is verv nearly at the ;
rate of a hundred per crnt, "during the last!
twel 'e months. iShould this increase be ;
permanent,-and should the lu'ure increase |
be in any propor:ion to that of last year, j
the cotton trade with the East Indies will, J
in the course of a dozen years, be one of the j
most valuable branches of trade in the !
the empire, *to the shipowner, the mer-i
chant, the manufacturer, and to the people j
bothoflndia and the British Islands'. . To
the British ship owners this trade will be j
particularly va uable, both from the Ieng'.h j
of the voyage from lad a and lirom the ab- j
ssencc of foreign competition in this branch j
ot the carrying trade, it wi:i not ue k-ss {
valuable to merchants engaged in the trade j
to India as furnishing a saleable return for j
British goods imported: and if, as has J'
been contended, Iree labor is cheaper than i
slave labor, it will be not less beneficial to
tha manufacturers and people of this country,
by rendering the saple of our great
manufacture cheaper, and of course, by
cheapening the labrics made from it. Up
to the present time, the cotton of tae E ist
Indies is considerably inferior to the cotton
of the United States in quality and
condition, owing to the inferiority of the
seed, the culture, and the mode of prepar- j
ing it, but since Europeons have been al- i
lowed to hold and cultivate land in India, |1
we may reasonably expect as great an ;
improvement in the co.ton of India us in (
the indigo, which, Irom being almost un- !
saleable, has almost superseded tint ol all :
other countries- We believe that the pub- 1
lie have as yet a very inadequate idea of I

Prevention of Stc<*ui'roat boilers from 1
Exj'losion.?Dr. M hitohead, professor of; 1
chemistry, and formerly of Oxford Uuiver- :
sty, writes to the editors of the National j1
Intelligencer, that ir is a mistaken notion i
tint the upper part of the boiler does not i
decompose the water, and thus produce i
hydrogen gas, as well as the lower exposed !1
direc.ly to the heat. Nor is the snfoy |!
valve of any use, or in any w a;, affjcted j
by that gas. He thus concludes: j .
"The remedy against explosion is iiap. j '
pily as simple <md as easy as t ie disease . r
itas hithrto proved fatal and frequent; and t
it is, to coat over the whole interior of cv- j I
cry iron steam bodcr with copper or any j '
other suitable mettle or alloy, which will; i
prevent the disengagement of hydrogen gas ! c
by the decomposition of steam cr water, j r
tiiose metals not having tlie same high do- i
gree of attraction for the oxygon of the i
water as to produce its decomposition, and (
the consequent production of hydrogen. 1
The above theory receives strong con- 11
firmation from the consideration of a vcrv '1
rv'markahic fact, namely, that on the waters : i
ol the sea board, where the boilers are en- ! s
tin ly of copper, explosions are seldom I <
known to happen, or when they do, may be J i
traced to culpable negligence; whereas on ' I
our interior waters, which are fresh, the S:
boilers are constancy exploding, without j1
any apparent cause. * The mystery, how-'
ever, will cease when we recollect, that j
they are all made of iron.-'

NATURAL HISTORY. '
The King Snake.?There is a largo *
species of speckled snake, commonly cal- :
kd in the southern states, the King Snake,
perhaps because he is the most formidable J
enemy of the rattresnake. It seems to le j
the chief object of his existence, to pursue '
and destroy the latter, whose retreats and *
presence is discoverable by the emmission 5

cucumber vine. The King snake, to all j *
other than reptiles, is the most harmless of! J
creatures, you may strike him, he shows 1
no resentment, ho hisses not, he turns not, 1
nor does he exhibit any terror nor sl?v\ ;
gishness. Drawn by the smell of cucurn- J
hers, he frequently enters gardens, but his
appearance excites no alarm in any human \
being that knows that he :s tbe King snake; J
and on the contrary, women and children I
will approach h.m, turn him about with a 1
stick, and playfully annoy him, with impu. 11
nity; he is only a relentless enemy of the c
rattlesnake, whos; strength and venom 1
avail nothing against the activity and mode k
of attack of die King snake, wiio is always
victor in every combat. f
Ye the rattlesnake is a terrible repair.? k
There is a peculiarity truly appalling in the 1
sound of his rattles, being unlike the noise J
of any other creature; and when you hear ^
the first time, the true instinct of nature im- (
presses on your quailing heart that danger (
and death are near. Never shall I forget 1
one horrid evtn of my life! I was fishing (
in a southern lake, one summer c'av, when *
an unusual disposition of sleep came over 1
me. I stuck tiie end of my fishing rod in *
i i . > . r i ! t
the hunk of the lake, ana sougm u Doauiuui j
place of shade, formed by the interlacing 1*
boughs of gigantic live oaks, and towering j1
magnolias, perfumed by the delicate odour j
of u beautiful wild orange, then in bloom, j ?
which had sprung up in luxuriant grandeur i 1
under the leafy eatiopv, the seed of which 1
had probably been dropped in this lonely J
spot by the Indian hunter or the wandering
wild bird. At its base, on a carpet of \
green moss sprinkled over with its fallen
and snowy bloom, I stretched myself in
luxurious langour tor an hour's repo~o. I 1
slept. When I awoke, I turned on my j*
side, and perceived some distance from me, 1
two brilliant orbs; and instantly a tremulous, J
mingled sensation of an indefinable nature
came upon my faculties. Something of an
instinctive dictate or impulse counselled 1
tnc to avert my looks; but then there was s
such an absorbing, wishful delight in ga- c
z'ng into eyes, that intently and meltingly
gazed into mine, that even the tnMhuious
pulsation of fear fixed my frame, and 1
I remained so facinated that I could see
nothing but the most beautiful colors. In I \
sho'1, I was totally los4, so completely he- !
wiider. il with commingled emotions, that
f could not withdraw mv gaz? nor even
. 3
move.
Suddenly, the melting eyeballs glared i
ivith sparks c>f fire?there was a move, i
ment?I was still in a dreamy s ate?butj:
still distinctly saw an enormous rattlesnake;!
\ ing in his coil, his tail quivering with a j 1
vibrating motion, his head erect and drawn ' ,

Duck, wiili the jaws distended, and the j ~
mgs bur re !?within three feet if where Is
I fay. Irs gaze had been disturbed ; and i
when I hoard t ie ha'cful rattle sing, the
ull consciousness of my dangerous situa-j
ion aroused id :, and through all my frame j
[ felt the ex'rem tv of terror; and just as 1 j
was about obeying a frenz cJ impulse to
ise and fly?God of heaven ! I felt the
ieadiy reptile us I thought, coiling around
ny neck; i saw part of his body?I felt
he cold and slimy skin upon my neck,1
ind the shiver of horror went through
2very joint and member of my frame.? j
Such a f eling of agony ! n.y eyeballs j
svere filled with scorching fire; my veins j
were frozen; ali tilings became of a blood :
red hue?and then of a sickly and loath,
some yellowish green. There are moments
af existence, which involve the sensation j
of years, and when the whole detail of a
thousand fi lings scarcely occupy the brief
space of a leisure thought. Nature could !
endure no more, and I lost all sense.
Atlength I had the painful tingling sen-!
sation of returning life through my veins,
and when in full consciousness I arose
from the earth, 1 saw near me, tranquilly
and quietly, a living King snake, and furthcrofl",
the lifeless length of a tremenduous
Rattlesnake. I sat upon a log and reflected;
and 1 am now satisfied thai the King
snake had crept over my neck to my res- 1
cue?there being the live oak at my feel 1
and the lake immediately back of the or- 1
ange tree on whose massy root my head
had been pillowed?so that ids t e.irest
route td the enemy was ever tny body. But j

lanks we re kept within bounds; b'a ices i
tore not permitted to accumulate, the cur- *
cncy of the country was in as good a state t
is could reasonably be expected. Our pa- t
ler was every where convertible into cash, I
vithout diflicuby. The finances of Govern- t
ncnt entrusted to that Bank, were managed r
vitb a cheapness and facility, that left nolh- <
ng to bo desired; and the whole currency r

Britain. Nor is it to be denied by any man t
vho lias a character to lose, that the notes t
)fMr. Middle's Bank were several years r
^referred to coin. During thirteen years. (
i50 millions of the public money were transerred
to and from all parts ol the Union,
.vitlioiit the loss of one cent, through the j
ixeellent management of that Institution.

L829, supported by Mr. Woodbury and Mr. i
Fiil!, to effect the removal of Mr. Mason,'
President of the Branch Bank at Portsmouth,
n New Hampshire, from his office, because
te was not friendly to Gen. Jackson's elecion
and administration. This measure was
supported by the S?cretary of the Treasury,
Mr. Ingham, who undertook to state to the
Bank "the views of the Administration in
elation to this appointment!." The Prosdent
ofthc Bank,with concurrence of the Di.
cc ors,replied to Mr. Ingham,thutjie rightly
lpprehendcd his views; but acknowledged
io responsibility to the Secretary of' the
IYeasury touching the political conduct of
he officers of the Bank; that being a subect
on which they consult no administration.
Flint the Bank has duties to perform toward
he country, but not toward any party, whose
pretensions it would not acknowledge or
compromise with. In the present case,
he best mode of satisfying all parties, was
0 disregard them all.
The President, Jackson, who had re peaediy
spoken of the bank of the United
States, without objection or reprehension,
low began to formal attack upon that injtitution,
in his Message of 1929. This
vas continued in 1830, 1831, 1832, and

complaints against that bank, frequently

The London Morning Chronicle has five s
columns as a biographical sketch of Wil- j

21st of August, 1765. At the age of 13 s
he was a midshipman, and though the sen
of a King, (George III) he was kept on a i
footing with the other midshipmen. Under
Admiral Rodney, he was in the fleet
which, in 1779, captured the whole of a
Spanish convoy. Eight days after he was J
1 in a serious fight with the Spanish fleet, \
under the command of Don Juan de Lan- >

and off tho coasts of Nova Scotia and

ras new to us, to learn that the shrub caled
Buck-Eye was fatal to the fish of our

ind Dr. J. M. Worth tried the experiment
rery successlully a few days ago, in a Title
pool of water, on the Doctor's plantaion
of Montgomery Connty. The onlv

jegan to throw themselves simultaneously

raught 230 fish in a few minutes. And

The Boston Daily Advocate of the 28th of
'uly, contained a correspondence between
Messrs. Wm. Foster, and John Q. Adams.
Mr. Fester requested Mr. Adams to favor the
jublic with his views on tlie appropriate policy
)f the government in relation to the revenue.
Mr. Adams's reply is as follows:
Quincy, July 1,1837.
Hrm. Foster, Esq. of Boston:
Dear Sir?Your friendly letter of the 21st
alt. has, perhaps, remained too long unanswered;
but when I received it, I had expressed
opinions respecting the present condition of
ai r public affairs, in answer to inquiries
from some of my constituents of the twelfth
congressional district, which have since been
pub-'chcd, and which I presume arc as explicit
as you may think they ought to be at this
time, and which will pass for what they are
worth in the community.
I still believe it the duty of every good citizen
to contribute, according to his ability, toward
forming and modifying public opinion,
because she is more than ever the queen of
the world, but for the regulating of my own
conduct, a long and trying experience has
taught me two lessons, though not always to
square my conduct by them. The first is, to
distrust tiie correctness of my own opinions
upon every thing pro. jclive and conjectural;
the second, never to "flatter myself that my
opinions will have any influence upon the action
of any other human bemg.
Thus, in the present condition of our country,
1 have very decided opinions upon the
rrast; differing, perhaps, considerably from
purs; certainly differing from those of a
arge majority of the people of the United
Sates. And as our views of the expedient action
for the future, might, in a great degree,
lepend upon the conclusions to which we have
:omeupon the past, it is impossible that the
measures which I Jiould deem the only etFec:ive
remedies for our complaints should be acceptable
to the ruling jwwer of the country.
[ am, and during a great part of my life have
seen, in the minority. It is the business of
:he majority to propose and accomplish
measures. It is too much the practice of mi
loritics to expend all their energies upon donees
to defeat the measures of the majority,
rhe question of r?fkt and wrong, so far as
my experience goes, is of use to either party
anly for the purpose ot making professions.
We are now in the midst of a national
bankruptcy, occasioned by the insolvency cf
multitudes of individuals. We are now told
that all the banks in the United States have
suspended specie payments. And what is the
suspension of specie payments bu? setting the
laws of property at defiance? If the president
and directors of a bank have issued' a million
:>fbills, promising to pay five dollars to the
holder of each and every one of them, the
suspension of specie payment is, by one act, a
breach of one million of nromises. What is
this but fraud upon every holdef of their bills?
And what difference i? there between the
president and directors of such a bank, and
Lhe skilful artist who engraves a bank bil\ a
fac simile of the bill signed by the president
and directors, and saves them the trouble of
signing it, by doing it for them! The only
difference I can see in lhe two operations is,
that the artist gives evidence of superior skill
and superior modesty. It requires more talent
to sign another man's name, than one's
own; and the counterfeiter docs at least his
work in the dark, when the suspenders of specie
payments brazen it in the face of day, and
laugh at the victim and dupes who have put
faith in their promises.
You ask what is to be the remedy of this
state of things? There are two remedies, both
of which may be practicable. One is, that
Lhe congress of the United States should ex
r?rr.iRp irs nowers to recreate the currenevr
but they must do this (which they will not)
without consulting banks, their presidents,
md directors. The legislatures of N. York
and Virginia have already shown that the presidents
and directors of banks will advise.?
And the proposal of the president of a broken
bank in Charleston, South Carolina, to begin
with an amendment to the constitution granting
powers to congress, which have already
jecn granted to them, and which they have
;wice exercised to the great benefit of the na:ion,
is an insult at once to our understanding
ind upon our misfortunes.
As little do I relish his other proposal of a
general convention of broken bank presidents
and directors, to enlighten Congress with
iheir advice; a convention of bankrupts to
leach Congress reverence for the obligation
jf contracts, and how to make nothing but
jold and silver a tender for the payment of
debts! Of all remedies for existing evils the
last I would resort to would be a spurious
coin from the mint of nullification. V
The other remedy which I deem practicable
is that of Solon?a sponge upon the accounts
debtor and creditor?wipe out all aid
scores and begin again. This is the bard
money system, and so far as 1 can judge, it is the
essential system of the present adminis-.'
tration?it is to detach the government fronr
all banking, and deal in^ nothing but the pre- * *
:ious metafr. If Mr. Van Buren is made of
*o rrr> throvgh with this operation. I wish
