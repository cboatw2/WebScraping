THE GOVERNMENT LOAN. iq
We find the following interesting article upon i
this subject in the Philadelphia Daily Chronicle: j s
"Sonic misconception in relation to this matter . t
exists in the public mind, and. also in relation to ! t
the mission of a Commissioner to Europe. Wejs
propose to exhibit the matter in what we con- v
ceive to be its true lbrh'. so far as our inform a- | a
tion, upon which we place much reliance, will j j
enable us. ! [
The conduct of European monieil agents in i i
this country was such as to impress upon the |
Government very strongly the belief of a com- < \
bined attempt to dote,at tiie loan for ulterior pur- t
poses. The Government, with a vcrv proper j
sense of its dignify, and what was due 10 ns j
national credit, determined to possess itself of j:
more'accurate information in relation to tliisj'
supposed combination of European capitalists < i
and domestic speculators; and, for t his purpose,! '
sent a Commissioner to Europe, with incidental J1
power to dispose of the loan, not lower than par, . f
in case he found the suspicion of such a oombi- j I
nation unfounded. The Commissioner, as we j I
have reason to believe, upon lite evidence of, t
letters from some of the most eminent bankers j t
of Europe, was confirmed in bis belief tint'
these suspicions were well founded, and, con- f
6equently, in no instance did he oiler the Go- 1
vernmcnt loan, and has brought back no money. ]
The main object of his mission lias, however, 1
been accomplished, to wit; to ascertain wheth- }
er or not a combined effort was making to tar- <
hish the national credit, for the sinister purpose <
of enforcinga degrading submission. The cvi- t
dences were too various and too palpable to ad- [
mitof a doubt. The miserable pretence that, *
the national credit was not to be trusted, was
contradicted by a variety of propositions in di- '
rect collision with such a belief. Assumption '
was to be the panacea by which all evils were
to be cured. The number and variety of advi- i
ces and lessons of wisdom which were volun- '
teered to enlighten the mind of our Commission- t
er, would, if recorded, exhibit an amusing spe- t
'imnn nf lnnric. htf which all conflict it) ? Varieties
of opinion terminated in the same result. 1
The example of England issuing her bonds s
for the Canada loan, was cited as a mode by *
which the national government could relieve the 2
States, and thus embarrassing itself, be the bet- <
terable to pay its own debts, than it would if f
unincumbered. , *
We were very much struck with one of the
arguments used by an eminent house Ibr the purfose
of securing an assumption of State debts. J
t was this; That a national scrip bearing three ?
per cent would bo more acceptable to holders <
than State scrip at five, six, or ton per cent.? t
Thus, at the very moment of making I he loan '
to States, assuming that the loss assurance of 1
safety required a higher premium of insurance, 1
calculating that receipts of interest over three >
per cent, would constitute such a fund, that if
defalcation ever did occur, it would make up )
any deficiency which a depreciation of the loan 1
might occasion. We are told that they are unwil- t
iing to lend the national government at three (i
per cent, interest, because they cannot trust H
them. And now, when the very event, has in 1
a very small degree occurred, and lor the risk
of which they charged three or four for cent, per
annum in insurance, in the shape of extra in- 1
terest, they wish the national government to
assume all the loss, for running the risk of which,
they were paid so large a premium.
We discuss this matter with reference solely
to the national government. For the propriety '
mid duty of States paying their debts, tli^ro can 1
be no more decided advocates than we are. Hut c
the secret of this combination of European cap- c
. __j .1 l_? 1.. 1^..?.. r
ltcilist ana nuiuusuc bpucumiuid umy icunuu out
at the last moment, by one more communica- P
five than the rest. And what, gentle reader, c
do you suppose it was? That they were afraid c
to trust the national government for five mil- 1
lions? No! But because the loan was not a F
hundred millions. The bait of five million six ^
percent loan was not sufficient to induce them ?
to give up their game of assumption, but a bun- "
dred millions of six per cent long loan would be, c
and the reason is as plain as day light. Our 1
three per cent national loan being equal to the '
best European investment, the extra three per ^
cent, would make up all deficiencies in the de- 0
faulting State loans; and thus they would actu- 1
ally receive the full amount of both, while they 0
would continue to taunt us with defalcation, after
having received, in fact, though not in form, ^
payment of both national and State debts. ^
These, so far as our letters, and they arc En- 11
glish letters too, will enable us to judge, are the 11
conclusions to which our Commissioner, and all P
others acquainted with the facts, must arrive.? '
That this combination, powerful as it is, must "
utterly fail, the actors in it will be convinced, '
upon the first appropriate occasion upon which ^
.1-/1 . A Ii
ine vjoverniuuiu win anuuv n? n. .-?<m .?u
no doubt, so far as we can judge by inferences, "
that the most inflexible determination exists
against the entertainment of such a proposition ''
as assumption. ri
In concluding this article, we can only say w
that the national loan has not been refused in 11
Europe, for the very satisfactory reason that it v
was never offered. The right of the Commissioner
to dispose of it at par, was predicated uppon
his ascertaining that no such hectoring coin- ^
bination as was here suspected." t c

INTERESTING FROM CUBA.
The sclir. Burlingtoo, Cnpt. Ellis, arrived at
this port last evening from Givara, Cuba. She
was bound to New York, and owing to a stress
of weather put into this port, having experienced
some damage in heavy gales. b
The passengers of the Burlington have politely
furnished for publication the following state- c
ment:? '>
"On the 16th day of October, appeared off the
port of Givara, a small sloop showing English e
colors, from which a boat put off and came into v
the harbor, having on board David Trumbull, c
Esq., member of Parliament, one of the mixed
Commissioners of the African Board, with au- n
thority from the English Government to demand "
the liberation of not only the English blacks in <1
this part of the Island, buto/ all Africans intro- P
duced since the treaty of 1821. Immediately on c
landing, dressed in full uniform, he called upon n
the commandante of tlie port, presenting his ''
passport, and desiring if he could proceed iinme.
diately to certain plantations which he named,
with a view of prosecut ing his intentions; stating p
that his vessel'would lay off the harbor during p
his short absence. If
This the Conimandate positively refused, or- s
dering at the same time the vessel to e tier the
port On anchoring she was Imrded by iheau- r
thorities and found inarmed with negroes,?ihc tt
pilot or captain of -aid vesse', one Toin Carter "
by name, a free ur.illattr, a S, an sli outlaw and ! '
perpetrator of illegal acts on this side of tim i;
Island, and who for maiiv years the Spanish an- o
thorities have been on the .,?? rhe. A guard b
was placed on board to prevent any communica- tl
tion with the ?hvre. .Mr. Tnimbu!! {.'ten rc- "
ues'.ed permission to proceed to the town o
lo'guin, where the governor of the district re
ides, desiring at the same time the protection o
he authorities, and whether it were^afe for hin
o go without arms, as lie had nothing but hi?
word. The Commandante assured him that hi
vould be perfectly safe, and ordered a corpora
nd two men to accompany him with strict in
unctions not to allow .Mr. T. to enter into an;
lantatiou or communicate with any one on hi:
ou'e.
On presenting himself at the Governor's hi
vas recognised as the English Consul, who ha<
aused so much trouble in Havana a short liirn
igo, and who orilv saved his life by flying fo
irolection on board the English guard ship here
in,! in consequence of opinions and acts express
d by him to the injury of the planters of thi
slainl, was ordered off and forbid to return t<

vas immediately arrested and placed under tin
mrveilauce of a double guard no one being al
lowed to sec or speak to him. Orders wen
ikewisc issued to place the crew and captain o

.vhere they now are.
Mr. Trumbull and company will be sent o
dioril v by a steamboat, which is expected at Gi
vara dailv, to the Havana, to he placed at thedis
posal of the Captain General, the Governor no

The arrival of this gentleman has caused area

3 heard with extreme astonishment, accompanied
t with a smile, at a proposition for destroying an
institution closely interwoven with the frame of
t society in this country, and intimately connects
ed with the law and with the habits, and even
I the religion of all classes of the people, from
j the sultan himsel'" down to the lowest peasant.
I "The sultans for some centuries past have

"To carry what your lordship desires into execution,
it will be necessary to limit the law of
succession to the crown and alter the policy
that has so long guided the sultans in that respect,
and also to change fundamentally the
political and civil instilu'iotis and laws and all

Noble Self-Demi ion?A few weeks ago two
miners, Verrau and Koborts, were at. work in
South ('aradon shalt (which is intended to lie
sunk perpendicularly, through a grnni'e country,
lo intersect the load at the depth of 110 fathoms ) |
The present depth is altout 10 fathoms, and they
had prepared a hole lor-blasting, the lusoc in-j
serted, lamped up, and already for firing. On
these occasions the men arc drawn up by a wind-'
lass, and as thefg are only three men in a corps,
there is only one man at the brace, and he cat*
only draw up onfi man at a time; consequently,
after the whole is ready one man is drawn up,
and the kibble lowered ready to receive the last
man, who was to put fire to the fusee, and then
botli men at the windlass draw hirn up with the
utmost speed, in order that all may get out of u
the way when the explosion takes place, which 1<
is sometimes so violent that, large stones are n
thrown up at the top, carrying with them part of
the roller and windlass to a considerable height, '
It unfortunately happened that, as the safety fu- i n
see with which the holes was charged was long- ! T
er than necessary they inconsiderately took a
sharp stone to cut a piece of it off and ignition instantaneously
commenced! They both flew to ,
the kibble, and cried out to the man at the brace
to 'wind up,' but alas! after trying with all his 0
might he could not start them. At this awful p
moment (while the furious hissing at the fusee
assured them that their destruction was within a
j half a minute's march of them, Verran sprang ^
, out of the kibble, exclaiming to his comrade, RoI
berts, 'go on brother, I shall be in heaven in a
I minute!" Consequently, Roberts was drawn up, A
and Verran threw himself down, and placed his g
poor devoted head under a piece of plank in one j.
corner of the shaft awaiting the moment when
he should be blown to atoms. Just as Roberts ?
got to the brace and was looking down with
trembling apprehension on the fate of poor Ver- ,'
ran.thp whole went off with a tremendous explo
sion, arid a small stone struck Roberts in the f,
forehead as he was looking down the shaft. To
the inexpressible surprise and joy of the men at a
the brace, they heard Verran cry out 'don't be
afraid, I am not hurt!' Roberts immediately descended,
and found that the great burden of the t \
blast was thrown in every part of the shaft ex-1 ci
cept the corner where poor Verran was coiled t|
, up! The extraordinary circumstance has produced
a considerable sensation throughout the c
district. Not only do they view the escape as a b;
miraculous interposition of Divine Providence, a,
but the conduct of Verran as a noble christian
will do in the moment of extremity.

An Unique Boxing Match?Ar, English pa-1 w
per states that two of the divers engaged in I V
breaking up the wreck of the lioyal George, Qj
quarrelled and fought at the bottom of the sea,
a few weeks since, for the honor of slinging up
a large timber to the surface, the quantity got
by each diver being carefully measured and v<
registered in the book of operations. In the w
scuffle, one of them, who was being hauled up, ^
kicked the other on the head with his leaden- .
soled shoe, breaking the lens of his diving hel- Is
met, so that the water rushed in upon him, but .lu
was kept in check by the air from the pump on
dick, which saved him from being drowned.? ?]
He was, however, nearly exhausted when pulled
up from the bottom, so that it was necessary
to send him to the hospital, where he was recov- n'
ered in a few days. The other diver, who was sc
uncuncious of the severe injury he had inflicted
upon his competitor until they both came up,
was very much grieved. A boxing duello, 12
fathoms down under the surface of the sea, i6 m
perhaps unparalleled in the history of mankind.
The Vicksburg Sentinel states with confidence
that a personal reconciliation has been
brought about between Gen. Jackson and Mr.
Calhoun. We hope this is true. Between two by
men of such geneious natures, after the lapse of th
six or seven years since they stood in violent cr
opposition as public men, such personal acerbities
as prevented them in the heat of political 'r(
rivalries, frotn doing full justice to each others | ha
motives, must be smoothed if not entirely dissi- co
patcd Mr. Calhoun can no longer look upon j
the veteran hero, waiting in his retirement with
pious resignation, for the approach of that sol- _ 1
emn hour, of which the shadow already begins in
to dim his vision, and reverently discarding as th<
far as human frailtv can. the passions and resent
merits of his sterner manhood, as he was accus- LC1
tomed to regard the resolute chief of a trium- w'
pliant party with which he had so many warm se'
but unavailing struggles. And the venerable pa
ex-President, loaded with years and honors, and
in view of putting off his mortal part, purging
his mind of the grosser impulses which a life of rai
action, excitement, heat, strife and triumph, I in<
must have left there, does a noble justice to a gal-1 w]
lant adversary, in exchanging forgiveness for ac
mutual imprudences, and bearing testimony for,,
each other to the integrity with which each had t0
pursued the path of conscience, although in stor- otl
my ami perilous times they had stood at the head be
of hostile columns. In such a reconciliation, there
need be no mention between them of past conflicts
of opinion, of opposite views of public duty, "
of uncancelled differences of political theories, 6h
or indeed, anv thimr but merely reirret that their hri
ancient friendship should have ever been interrupted.

The democrats go for principles and not men?
is not sufficient for them that their candidate
ould be " available." Their object is not toeak

e surest method of securing this object. The

and devoted to those principle*, which as
never hesitated to avo.v in the face of friend
well as foe, he wil' never cease to maintain."
