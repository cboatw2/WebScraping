A SEMINOLE TRADITION.
BY WASHIr'GTON iRVING.
When the Floiridas were erected into a
territoryotlie United States, one of the
earliestcares of the Governor, William 1.
)uval, was directed to the instruction and
civilization of the natives. For this pur
pose he called I meeting of the chiefs. it
which he inforined them of the wish of
their Great Father at Washinaton, that
they should have schools and teachers a
Imo-ng them, and that their children should
be instructed like the children of white
men. The chiefs listened with their ci
tomary silence and decorum to a long
speech. setting forth the advantages that
would accrue to lthen front this measure.
and when he had concluded, begged the
iuterval of a day to deliberate on it.
On the following da.-, ;I solemtin convo
cation was held, at which one oftheir chiefs
addressed the Governor in the name of all
the rest. "3y brother," sail he, "we
have been thinking over the proposition of
our Great Father at Washinton, to send
teachers and set up schools among ts,
We are very thankful for the interest I:c
takes in our welfare; but after mt:ch de
liberation. have conclided -o decline his
ofl'er -What will do very well for white
men. will not do for red menti. I know you
white mwn say we all come from the same
father and nother, hut von are tistaken.
We have a tradition hiaded down from
our fore!fatliers. and we believeit, ihat the
Great Spirit, when lie undertook to miake
men, made the black man, it was his first
attempt, and pretty well for a begitiig:
but he sooe saw that he hungled; so he
determined to try his hand again. He
did so, and he nade the red tian. Ile
liked him much better than the black mail.
but still 1e was not exactly what he want
ed. So lie tried once more, and made
the white man-and then lie was satisfied.
You see; therefore that you were tiade
last, and that is the reason I call you my
voutinest brother.
Wen the Great Spirit had matde the
three men, lie called them together and
showed them three hoxes, The first was
filled with books. and maps, and piper'
the secotd with hows and arrows. kives
and tomahawks; the third, with spade-,
axes, hoes, anl hammers. "These, m1
sonS," said lie, "are the means by which
you are to live: choose among them accor
ding to your fancy."
The white man heing the favorite, had
tihe first choice. Le passed by tihe box
of working tools, without notice; but when
lie came to the weapons lor war and hunt
ing, he stopped and looked hard at them.
The red iman trembled. for ie had set his
eye upon that box. The white mati,
however, after looking upon it for a m
inent, passed on, and chose tie box of
books and papers. The red utan's turn
had no choice left, but to ptt up with the
box of tools.
From this it is clear that the Great
Spirit intended the white man should
learn to read and write: to understand oll
about the moon and stars; and to make
every thing, even ruim and whiskey.
That tli- red int should he a firs rate
hunter. anti a mighty wa-rior, ht he was
not to learn any thitig from hooks, as tle
Great Spirit had not given him any ; tior
was lie to make rum and whiskey, lest lie
shouldl kill htimself withI dritnkitng. As to
the black mani, as lie had tnothing bher
working tools, it wvas clear lie was to wortk
for the white and red man. which lie has
continued to do.
We nmuit go according to the wsishes of
the Great Sprit, or we shall get into tron
ble. To kniow how ton readl and wirite is
very good fur white ment, but very had for
red tmco. It matkes whlite men better, but
the red tmen worse. Somue of thte Creeks

TilE COTTON CROP.
It is important that a few facts should
he placed before our readers in reference
to the present crop. There is a universal
belief at tle South that the supply of Cot
ion this year will be less than t hal or the
last, uIamong the planters it is confidetuly
allirmed that the crop will be less ahatn for
everal years. We ourselves iline to
this last opinion. It will be asked, then,
if such be the case, why has rot the price
risen? We answer, the market has not
yet fell thedeHciency. and in truth, to the
exporters and consumers of cotton, the
fct -If dehicency is not yet apparent.
They will not trouble themselves in ad
vance, however much the planters may
and rntat, when they see uue half their
storehouses empty.
The mianufcacirers feel it not, becauasc
the old stock in their senports is very large
considerably more aian it was last year.
and they have besides been tempted by
the low'priev of ahe articl-, to lay by con
iaideralle in advance of their eoaantiltion
The troubled condition of Europerender
ing it hnzzardonas to depend on the contin
'jance of Peaceable commercial relations;
the increase of taxes nad the absorption of
rast s (if money in public loanns for
wnrlike preparntinst5., have had no little in
luence in clecking nanafactures, by in
reasing the demand for money, and
have added panie to the actual resamraatQ
on business. 'rite contt tnpaion wotld
ndubtedly be considerably less than in
quieter times.
The exporters of Cotton have not yet
felt nty deficiency. The stock oan hand
on the 1.% Octobe'r 1840, in all the Sotth
ern ports and New York and Philadelphia
was 51000 bales--same time in 1836, it
was 4:3.651). rhe reeripts since that, by
he latest prices cut rent, ill New Orleans.
Mobile, Georgia and South Carolina, have
aeen 138,006 lald.s-sane timtle last year
oanly 12-2.300. The entire stapply in the
market, then, siuce alae 1st Oct., has been
20,000 bales greater tihan for lie sarne pe
riod of lasIt year, when the crop was the
reatest ever known. There is besi-les
this, the further and imporint fort that the
Soathtern banks are genaerally preparing to
resume cash payments. which canl never le
done without somea ht increasing the
value rand the demand fir money.
We trust we have fully taccounted for
all the present depression in the Cutto t
market, and it now behooves us to accout Iat
for lae apinion we confilently expre..e ithat
!te supply or la year will be seriously de
icient. The tmere fact ofn certait qua
tity ofcotton ctoma;;; early to market,
proves nothing as to what rerlains be
himl. A short crop is soon prepared for
market. and for that very reason is likely
to arrive carly. If the platter has but
little to sell, the neces-ity will he the
Vreater to realize the proceeds of that little
as soOn as possible. Increased ficilities

have been nearly three times as great its

Imporutaions of Silk -The importa
ini of Silk durig the year ending the
t, of September, 18:39, anounted to
icarly twetity-thie millions of dollars, as
a if' be seen by) the follow ing items copied
rom hlie report of the Secretary of the
'rre;sory of the commerce and navigation
af the United States for that year, which
has been politely sent us by the Secreta

the statement piul;lished in the newspapers
tii upwards of two millions, as con'par

Compared with other articlea imported,
that of silkis one fourth more than the a
mount of any other. The amount of man

iation of* seuar antted to $9.224,632;
linen, 86,7.,A.278. So the importation of
qilk nearly eqnils that or woollen and
linen together, an: is equal to half of all
other fabrics coihned. Need we say a
word as to the importance of saving this
immense expenditure to the nation, now
that it is establihed beynd all question
that we are more capable of producing
the article of silk ourselves, than any other
