INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT.
Those who make it tlirir business to
operate on public opinion, arc all agog
for rail roads, canals, <fc'c. We have no
rt'^r objection to such improvements. In fact,
we are friends to them, provided tliey can
be. made without infringing in the least,
upon tin: rights and liberties of the people,
wlirch are iucompartb|y more vulua*
lilc than all the rail roads and canals 011
the face of tlu: earth.
That the power of monopoly is leagued
with the present system of internal iotpr
vement, cannot he doubled by any one
who will give to the subject the slightest
con-ideration. At litis time most of the
rail-roads belong to chartered companies.
* nndrure exerting an influence hostile to
the rights and welfare of (lie sovereign
people. They are rapidly monopolizing
the land transportation business, not excepting
the carrying of the mails. And
what are ihe consequences? Those Companies,
controlled by a few individuals
who have no reg ird for the equal rights
; of the people, are invested with immense
power, which they can exercise in a way
most conductive to their interest, regard
less of the public weal. But tins is not
the worst feature of the present system.
It unquestionably exerts an influence adverse
to the free exercise of the right of
opinion on subjects of government. That
this right has been interfered with in nia.ny
instances, and attempts made to eon.
trol it by fear, favour, or money, is no
longer a matter of doubt. The recent
elections furnish many well authenticated
and alarming facts of this kind.
If such are the effects ef th-is system
'during its comparative infancy, what mav
reasonably be expected from it when it
has reached its maturity; when the whole
"face of the country is checkered with rail
roads and canals belonging to the money
power? Is not the subject worthy of the
thoughtful consideration of every friend
,< to our free institutions? Undoubtedly it is.
TKey should examine it with the utmost
? particularity, and if it is fraught with
evils which must overbalance the good,
they.should be destroyed, or else the sys- '
tern'should be abandoned, as it is 3 dictate
of common sense, that lesser evils should
be preferred to greatei ones.
Undoubtedly those who are deeply In- j
. tercsted in the success of the present system,
and whose sole object is self-agran(lizement,
will spare no pains to convince
the public that it is the b'*si which human j
ingenuity could devise; but prudence die-'
tates that their arguments be carefully ex- j,
.amine-* and their declarations cautiously!.!
received, as they are the interested party, I
and of course will use their utmost exertions
to color their side of the picture as
highly and as favorably as possible.
Among die arguments used in favour
of the p esent system of intern d improve-',
meats, the most common and successful i
oufe is directed to the pockets of the com- !|
rnuility. The people are. told that these !,
improvements will rapidly increase the j
value of properly, give employment <?>!,
labor, and facilitate the transportation ??f j t
commodities. But they are not informed t
whether they will iinpr -ve than otherwise t
the distribution of wealth, which i.s by far ,
the must importa it consideration. True j
national prosperity and social happiness r
lit) not consist in the mere creation of v
wfealth, but in its equitable distribution. t
Even before the wonderful improvements p
in labor-saving machinery, wealth was t
created with astonishing facility and in y
the greatest abundance. Since that time j
its rapid creation has almost exceeded t
calculation, and yet the great body of the
people in every country, and the wealth
creators ton, ere poor. England affords ,
a striking illustration of this fact. In
~ t 8
that country wealth is mure rapidly crealed
than auv where else, ami yet the mass t
of her population are miserably poor.? <
*>. .. Can this strange circumstance be account* J
, *;>j* cd fur in any other way save upon the
principle of partial distribution? Certainly
nut. Her laws regulating the distribu- t
tion of wealth arc as bad as thev can be,
- cordin luv by the. ncvn-cre ttors. She j
has a- numerous privileged Aristocracy, ,
\Vho live iike princes and produce nothing,
that. are exceedingly burdensome to pro- ^
ductile industry Aside from this immense.
weight, the expenses of iter government
ate enormously great, then comes .
the interest on her vast national debt, and
to cap the summit of her huge mountain .
of injustice heaped upon labor, is her
wicked corporation system, of which the '
Aristocracy here are the copyists, and are '
striving with all their might to fasten 1
upon the producing classes of this confe 1
drracy. If they succeed, the condition
of the laboring population in these Slates
will soon be as miserable as is the condition
of their oppressed brethren across
the water- But wc hope for the besl,
i t* I - - -
Having mncn continence in me foresight, '
the lionestv, and strong attachment of the
laboring classes to our Republican tnstitu- '
thins. I
v In view of these facts, we are opposed 1
to any. system of internal improvement,
. v . no matter by what name it is dignified, '
that is not as favorable to the distribution
^ as it is to the accumulation of wealth, he*
itig satisfied that all such systems are anlirepublicu
i iu -their spirit and tendency;

provements increase the value of propi
ty. Suppose they do, and what then? a
the majority of the people property hoi
erst? Not at all. lience, according
their own showing, the tendency of t
system is to heap up and coneentrt
wealth, rather than to diffuse and dist
little it. The pbopie are also told of I
wonderful facilities afforded to transpor
tiou, the astonishing impulse given tot
siuess, of towns springing up as if
magic; but are nil these advantages to
compared to the rights and liberties oft
many? Suppose the whole face of t
country was cross>barred with rail-roa
and canals, and the great body of the pe
pie were slaves, would such improvemei
tiro fit them? By no means. England

and yet her population are miserably poi
The whole Island nl Great Britain is ehet
ered with rail-roads, and yet the peoj
are driven by oppression to the brink
revolution. Provisions can be transpo
ed from one extreme of that Island to ar
ther with the utmost convenience and I
cility, and yet the millions are sufferi
for bread. Rail-roads are rapidly inert

people at all improving? D.? those ii

If not, of what benefit is the system to t
degraded multitude? It neither fills t
stomachs of a starving population, n
causes the galling manacles of slavery

In our humble opinion, all internal ii
provements should be made at the e
pense of the community in which they a
located; that the necessary funds be rais
by a direct tax on the people, and thalt
progress of the works keep pace with t
funds raised for defraying their expensr

The present mode of chartering injnpani

with mighty evils, dangerous to the si
biLity of our free institutions. We al
look with alarm at the present plan <0

provement upon the credit of the State
because it makes the many tributaries

Correspondence of the Courier.
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 2S.
The proceedings in the two Houses of Congrw
yesterday, were interesting and very important.
Tiic Senate it waa supposed, would dispose of the la
Jill. But an unexpected obstacle was interposed
in amendment offered by Mr. Berrien, which 4
urges the scop3 of the debate, and hazards the pi
iage of the bill. Ho moved to amend by providii
hat the distribution should cease when the rate
lulies shall be so regulated as to exceed the rate
wentj .per cent ad valorem, or, as he explained
vlien the compromise act shall be infringed upc
Hr. Huntington, and others, who are unwilling
ecognize the compromise act in this manner, ai
vould raifior give up the distribution than bo boui

Berrien objected to this that it might be nece
ary to impose countervailing duties, ia particul
:ases exceeding twenty per cent, and Mr. Rives' ra
ion was lost. After a good deal of discussion, tl
Senate adjourned in some confusion. The friends

his new danger.
In the House, Mr. Sergeant offered a reaolutic

This raised a storm on the part of the opposition.Mr.
S. modified the amendment so as to fix 4 ochx
Monday, and the previous question was order*
lpon it. The opposition then began, one after an
,her, to ask to be excused from voting on the res
ution, for the resson that it was intended to st<
ree debate in the House, and to force through i
mportant measure before it could be examined

orily. The House went into committee on the bi

vould have some good effects on the currency, ai

jpon the "kitchen cabal," who sought to contr
Vlr. Tyler, and make a third party.
As to this bill. Mr. Wise expressed his hope ai
xslicf that it would fall under the veto. He said t!
President was opposed to a bank of discounts, b
is was not in favor of a bank of exchange. N
Marshall has the floor for to.morrow, when the w
between Mr. Clay's friends and those of Mr. Tyl
will be continued. It was hoped that direct hoeti

would be avoided; but they have drawn tho swo
and thrown away the scabbard. Mr. Wise assail
Mr. Clay in every possible way?when he was call
to order and stopped, he evaded the objection, ai
was allowed to go on in the same strain, of invectii
by personifying rumor, and remarking upon tbi

ite consideration of the Fiscal Corporation bill, in comri

ta- evidence of the popularity whioh Mr. Marshall hasj

by we have had in the House this session. Many of

Jr. He had not himself voted for the bill which the

of. had never considered a bank to lend money as one of
ft* the necessary means of carrying out the granted
??* power; but a bank of exchange he had proferred and
fa* advocated at home. He replied to the remarks
11S which Mr. Wise had made on the course of Mr.

distribution shall cease when the Compromise shall

FISCAL CORPORATION.
The whig majority in Congress, with a spirit and
a pertinacity, worthy of a better cause, scaln determined,
at ail hazards, to force upon the country
a Nation.-*! Bank of some description.
Since the veto of Mr. Clat*s bill by the President,
a new scheme has been introduced by Mr.
SgROEANT of the House of Representatives, the details
of which we have not seen, and which has al.
ready passed that body and been sent to the senate,
and haSI in all likelihood been hurriod through the
latter before this paragraph shall reach our readers.
It is framed with the view of avoiding the objec.
Lions of the President, as stated in the Veto Mes.
age, but in our opinion, it is fur from accomplish,
ng this object, though Mr. Trcsa may, perhaps,
think differently. True, the schema proposed, is
tot to be a Bank, but only a Fiscal Corporation,
the old thing by a new name. There are to be no
Wanchss to the thing; agencies are simply to be lorated
in each State, and without their consent?
* n ali. :j_ is.li. au. d.?.:
til kill awiufl, cdpiullljrf hid uujtliuvllo ui aidoj*
lent Tyler. He it only opposed to a "National
Bank to operate per ?t over the Union." This beng
a mere Fiscal Corporation, although evidently
veil calculated to operate perse over the Union, hut
tot being a National Bank, of course does not
mae under the reasoning of the Veto.
Mr. Ttter too, is opposed to the establishment
>f the branches of a National Bank in the Slates
vithout their consent, and therefore the Fiscal Cor.
mutton, to steer clear of this difficulty, is to have
10 branches, but is to be carried on through the in.
itrument&lity of Agencies. The objection of the
President being to the branching power, this objec.
ion is, at once, happily set aside.
Thus it will be seen that we are to have a Nation.
11 Bank, the opinions of President Tyler to the
:ontrary notwithstanding. His difficulties in icla.
ion to the constitutionality of such an institution
ire all obviated, and he can now, according to the
noral code of the great file leader of the whig par.
;y give his assent to the scheme. In other words
io has been "headed" to use the significant language
>f the notorious John M. Botts, in his letter to
he Richmond Grog Shop; at least this effort is
nade with that intent, but how fur it may succeed j
emaina yot to be seen. We arc mucti misiaKcn,
lowever, in our estimate of the character of Mr.
as exhibited in his Veto Message, if this trap set
only to fasten him" according to Mr. Botts again,
ha!l succeed. We shall be much disappointed if 1 e
[oes not look with contempt look upon this effort, as
l wore by fraud and stia'.agcm, to obtain his assent,
o what he has, in advance, pronounced unconsti.
utional; and wc shall confidently expect this bill to
tc treated in the same manner, and to meet the same
ate, which the celebrated compromise section, in
Hr. Clay's bill enoountcred.
How he can escape the eloquent and manly con.
lemnation to which he says he would have been
ubjected, had he signed the other Bank Bill, if
ie assents to this, we cannot divine.
He says: i
"1 could not give my sanction to a measure of the
haracter described, without surrendering all claim,
o the respect of honorable men?all confidence on
he part of the people?all self respect?all regaid
or moral and religious obligations, without an ob
ervance oi wnicn no vrovernmeni can ue prosperus,
and no people can be happy. It would be to
ommitacrime which 1 would not wilfully commit
ogain an earthly reward, and which would justly
uhject me to the ridicule and acorn of all virtuous
nen."
The bill which is now, or will in a few days, be i
tefora him, is as objectionable in its princiial
features as the one to which he rcfcrsin the above <
ontcnce, and in tho estimation of a large body of I
lis follow citizens, he will as much violate all the i
irinciplea which he has heretofore sustained by giv. i
ng it his sanction as if he had assented to the other, i
Jow he may view the subject, it is, of course, im- j
Kwaible to say, but if any correct opinion is to bo I
ormed from tho history of his past life on the Bank 1
|uestion, a history which is marked by as much, If 1
lot more, consistency as that of any or all the emi- I
tent politicians of the present day, wc come to the i
onclusion that be will arrest this bill also. Specu. (

THOS. JEFFERSON, Joor. . f
To Mr John Harvey
at /
Bellemont. .
Jefferson was born at Shariwell, Albermarle
Co., Va., April 2d, O. S. 1743. and v
was therefore not quite seventeen.whenthe
letter was penned. This appeal to
Col. Harvey, who was his guardian; his .
father having died when he was but-twelve 4^:
years old, was successlul, and in the*- /
spring of 1760, he entered William
Mary College, which, at that time, was .
der most excellent management. Why he
signs his name Thomas Jefferson? Junforv
is a matter of doubt. His father's name <* :
was Peter and though the name of one of ? "
his uncles was Thomas, yet he died before-^ ^ :
young Jefferson was born. The only
solution is, that there might have been
another perhaps a relative of the same ,
name, and instead of following the new ;
ungliiuu jmoii in sutii u.iaco auu inj
Thomas Jefferson 1st and Thomas Jeflerion
2d, he wroteThomas Jefferson, Junior.
Our friend, Mr Tefft, has in his splen- ^
lid collection of autographs, eight or- ten
letters of-Jefferson, but the easiest date
n his collection, is an order of Jefferson's
while governor of Virginia, dated Rich*
nond, 8th May, 1781. This order was ,
;iven at the request ofLafayetle, to facili;ate
the movement of an officer whop) he
tad despatched to break down the bridge/
:o retard the enemy. The style of-pepnanship
is similar in all, though rath'er .
note cursive and easy in the meridianand.,
dose of life. Col. Harvey, the. gentleman
o whom the letter is -addressed, and the
juardian of young Jeftersdoj was -the
