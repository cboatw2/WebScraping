CIRCULAR.
Pellou cii:en.e--ierested like your
selves in the cultivition and di-sposal -ol
the great staple of A merican agriculture
and commerce, we have accidentally met
in this cit v, in the midst ofa crisis which dis
closes some sirikingly mnr)!t1-nitits features
in the history of this most important branch
of the trad(e of outr country
When thc cotton crop of *the United
States was a mere item in the trade, and
did not reach a production exceeding five
hundred thousaud balesit was perhaps safe
to conaider it as one among many articles
of harter and exchange, which, left entire
ly to the fortuitou ci.-cumstances of cotm
ncrce, would find its lev-l under the influt
ence of the ordinary laws of trade, with
out the necestity ofrreortingto any means
of precautionary protection.
Times, however, have changed. Cot
ton has passed from the condition of a
mere Rrticle of commerce, to the perform
ance of the mighty function of being in aI
great degree the regulator of the exchau
geq, and the standard of value of out; counn
try. If the nature of this m-terial forbids
its entering in our circulation, it is scarce
ly less the basis of our currency, than the
precious metals; for the fluc-uations in its
price are felt with a sensibility equally. as
acute and searching, a, any of those varia
tions which belong to the demand ind sup.
ply of these sensitive and mysterious to
kens of national value.
The production of this staple, has now
become so immense, that it behooves those
who produce it by a large investment of
capital at a high rate of incidental cost,
and in a climate perilous to human health,
toconsider well, whether there are not
some material circtumstances in reference
to the mode in which this product of their
laboris shipped from this country. and is
brought to market at the point o(f its ina!
sale and consumptinti. whichb demaud the
application of a prompt and effY-etive remtn
edy. In one word, is not the important
fact disclosed. that snch is the unwielly
amount of this great staple of sutahten
industry, that it cannot he sent forward iul
disposed of at fair retmtneratinz prices,
through the ordinarv medium of ihe mer
cantile establishmnents ofthis country an'd
in Etirope, withott the direct co-operation
of our bankiug instittions? It we have
become satisfied of this fract. ought wve not
to organize a system. which shall give per
feet security to this great interest in It
commerce and finances ofour countrv?
The unw ise andl ruinous system of sendhingt
the crop forward to houses ofcircuimscribed
means, on the other side of the water,
- who are incapable of holding their con
signmnents an hour beyond the maturity of
the hills drawn against such shipments,
subjects in fact nearly the "'hole arnon it
of American interests to foreign conmina
tion, which might act, not only with entire
concert, but with a perfect knowledge of
the period, when from the mnturitv of the
acceptances in question, properv to a
stupendoos amount belongine to this coln
try, may be ready for sacrifice.
The great and vital change which must
be operated, is to sustain American inter
ests, by Americani credit. To realize at
home. the resources necessary for the pro
tection of our properryabroad. without the
necessity of large and inconveni-nt drafts
on the capital and mneans of our great eats
tomer. in other words, the cormm'eial
reform we desire, is to send our great sua
plo to market, without 'the period beitng
determined avthe date of a Bill of E x
change. whean it is to bie brought forward
for absolumte and :u nnecessary saetifice.
We believe that the steadiness in price,
-which would result from a portion, at least,
of the Cotton crop being exempt from the
dienstrotts fluctnations arising from corm
pulsory sales, wotuld in the end, he scarce
ly less ialuable to the spinner and con
'ner in England. titan to the grower and
shipper here. A- fact, which wve thimnk de
monstrabale frotm the following postulates,
which we consider altoget her sel f-evidenut
1 . The natural price of Cotton is the ef
fect of the fair and natural influence of
supply and demand.
2. The price cannot he stecady, and the
article cannot be current, so as to admit of
safe calculations on the part of the plan
ters, the manufacturter and the tmerchant.
unless the pt-ice be natural. [r is consse
quently the interest of these three classes,
that the acIte should he protected on the
one hand fr'otn any great andr mndtue specu
}htive action, which might inflate prices
above the natural rate--and otn the other,
from any derangement in thte money mar
ket, or any other accidental cause, which
might depress it below that rate. The ef
fect of great undue speculation being to
dleranige the monev market. and to pro.
duce reaction, wvith an undue depressiotn
of priees.
3. The state of the cturrency mainly do
pends on the means which the country pos.
sesse~s to pay its foreign debt, by shipmen'st
of its produce. To the extent its prodncE
or'manufacture falls short of that object,
exports of specie may he induced, the effect
of which must be a reduction of the cireu
lation, with depreciation of property and
general distress
4. Cotton. in this counotry, being by fai
the most impiortant produce, and aflording
the great means of paying its foreign debt,
it is the interest of the community. and
partictularly of thc monied instituitions, that
the price of it in England, (the great mar
ket,) should be steady, and the article
should be of cutrrent sale, so as to be the
means of large and eflective remittance.
It follows, that theinterestof the banking
institutions here, are the same as those ol
the three classes first mentioned, namely,
that the price sh-id he nattural, that i
may be steady ande of easy realisation.
5. The interest of the British Govern
metit, of the Bank (of England, and of the
banks of that country in respect to this
article, are the same as the interests of the
banks here. The impportation there being
inhetnse, and the employment of a most
amuuerous body of the laboring classes, de
pendingodiithe steadiness ofprices. When
they are not steady--the foreign demand
for matnufhttired cotton is redutced gratly,
ment, and tlic great meansor settling the'
balance of trade, witiout the exportation
of the precious inetals are~ withdra wn.
M-anufacturedouttons affording by far, the
most important branch of their.export
trade.
6. Conseguently. nay arrangement that
could be foirmed. by which-the article would
be proterted froin the cflfects of undue spec
utation, and froimi depression in the money
market. and by which steadiness of price,
with enrrenevof sile, would be promoted
-would save some of the greatest a .d
best interests in both countries.
6. It is therefore proposed to form n sys
tem hy which, with the commencement of
the new crop. advances on Cotton shall
be made with the capital or credit ofBanks
here, thereby relieving the consignee in
Europe fron all care orconsideration, ex
cept the advantageous sale of his stock.
wiich would proimote all these interests;
and affbrd generai satisfaction on both
sides of the water, provided it were not
made the mean, directly or indirectly. of
undue spectlation or monopoly.
Havitng th is indicated the principles on
which the proposed system must find its
justification and basis, we will now as
sticcinctly as possible, detail ie means of
carrvin! it into effiect.
We are fir fromni imputing any premedi
tated hostility of the Bank of England to
American interests; on the contrary, it is
one of the benevolent influences of com
mercial inter -ourse, to promote peace and
good will among teien. Hence this engine
of the comitercial grandeur and opulence
of GreatBritain, acting under anl enlighten
ed instinct, must rather desire that its best
u-tomer should at all tiunes be in a con
dition to mteet her engagements with entire
ptictualitv a nd success.
But there are epochs in the commerce
of England. whether from itisufficient iar
vests, a lantnid de!nand for her manufac
tures, or poulitical combinations, when the
bank may. from an urgent policy, limit her
discount-c, and increase her rate of interest.
This event can never occur, without its
having a blighting influence on any sur
phis of otir great siale, which mright be
unsold in E nghomd. Surely .if the Baik of
Etigland can exercise (unavoidably) ani
influence thms prejudicial we may resort
to our owi A mnerican banks, as a mean
of -ectrity and )rotection. without the in
vidiois cilamor of combination' and mo
npoly. It is time that the absurd atil
senselesscry on the sublject of banks mla
king a Ivandes on cottoni, shold be under
Ntood and finally pot down. The trit:h i<
that by the mrere purchase of the foreign
cxchanges of the country. thev advan- e
on nearly evcry hale of Cotton sulbject to
foreign export, and this without the seen
rity ofthe bill of ladling atid policy of in
Mr;ance, nn the ttere personal responsibili.
tv of ihe drawers and emnorserq of the lill.
H-uce these losses are most comprehien.
sive and disastrous after every commer
cial crisis and revulsion.
Now we propose giving to the banks in
all caseq, the higher protection of these se.
curities, and thiat early next autuml, orne
or more banks in each of the great cm
mercial Cotlon markets of the South,
should commence making advances on
the crop, tecorling to a scale to be grnduna
ted by what will be a sal caleit t ion of
its probable amount, assuming 12 1-2ct'.
at hmne, to lie about the fair naturai av
erage nnd rentmerating price of this sia
ple, on a prodnet of sixteen hundred thon
sand hale-s. which is about as large a re
turn as the actual labor of ihe country now
m-ngaigeld in this brantrh of industry, is Ca
p1vble of harvesmitn. The etmbarrass
ments ofthle South-W~estern States hav'
ine prevented the Planters in these States
frnot m aking any purchases ofslavesn from
the Atlanttic States during the last two
years, whilst tnot less Ih-t t) h) or cent. of
the slave labor in the Soutth, has been ab
stracted in the sanme period from the eilti
vation of Cotton, and applied to the raising
of provihions, atnd to the constrcneti of
those extensive r ailroads now in progress
throughout that portiotn of the UnTtion.
For these advatnces, we propose thtat
the Banks shotild issue to tbe planters,
itnerchanits and factors ofthe country, otn
the production of th.- bill of Ladingr, andl
the assign(met of the policy of insurance,
Poist Notes of such description, and paya
hite as eh period as a Convention here
after contemplated, tay sugeest ; notes,
which may be made to answer both the
puirposes of curretncy anid exchange,the de
ails of which we refer to that body. By thi5
arran;;ement however, we feel saitisfied
the credlits cant he SO distr'ibted, that fonn
the day of t he shipment ouf our cotton, it
omay prohably lie held at least six onuths
in Europe, withour the foireien consignee
being under an atvatnce of one farthinig,
atnd we thitnk it sluite easy to cotnferoni the
houmses. to which the shipments are confi
dedi. suflicient strength, to enable thettn to
hold over for even a-longer period, should
saf,- remutnerating prices not be obtaitted
on the mtu~t try of the hills.
WVith the vie w of securing this strengt h
it is indispetnsably necesary, that the con
signmewnts should tnot be tooi munch iniffused,
but confined to a limited number of hou
sesin Liverpool and Havrge. who, acting
as the agents of all those who will com'e~
into this conserv'a:ive system. will feel a
common interest, anid will naturally aid
arid assist each other under all and e'very,
contingency.
This, Fellow-Citizens, is but a brief out
line of a great schemec, for the protectioni of
our Commerce, Finance, and Exchanges,
the details of wvhich, must lie left for pro
found deliberation, and cotncerted action.
To accomplish this object, we hereby in
vite the planters, factors and cotton mner
chants of each district or county ini the
Southera States, and Territory of Florida,
together with the Banks, in each of the
said States and Territory, to Bend Delega
tes to meet us in Convention at Macon,
Georgia, on the 4th Tuesday of October
next, which wvill be the 22d day of that
month, that we may carefully consider the
important matters disclosed in this Circu
lar.
WVe invite a candid examination of'this
wyhole scheme, for the protection, nor alone
of southern interests, but for the security
of the commerce of the whole country,
Let it at least be tested by patient in
vestigation, and enlightened research; if by
,this plan one third of the entire cotton crop
of the country can be placed beyond the
possibility of sacrifice, it will give security
to the residun. not by entrenchine& it be
hind the guards of aspeculative monopoly,
hut by holding it in that state'of security.
which the just relations of supply and dc
mand will always in the long run, estab
lisfi and sustain in the trade of a great and
civilized country.
That no tinw may be lost, we heg leave
to apprise you that an agent, hiving our
conlidence, will leave this shortly for Eu
rope, clothed with ample instructions. to
make such preliminary arraunemernts with
the houses in L iverpol and llavre. which
may, hv the -anction of the Convention,
have the proposed consmnnients.
We are an are of the very iotent nppo
;ilion, which a plan lookingr even to self
defence, must invite. bth at hoie anod a
broad, as it runs counter to it variety of
interests, too powerful and too suscept
pie ofcomhination, not to be aroused into
active, and perhaps inexorable hostility.
If our apology is not to be found in tie
plea, that we have a right to hold our own
property by the means of thecredit of our
own country, then we fearlessly say, toe
rutan at least to attempt it, in spite of an
opposition, however eager and implacable.
We have seen in the face of a crop of
1,350.000 hales, an effort made, and near
ly resulting in success, to coerce the ac
eptance of the sane prices, which were
incident toone of 1,800.000 hales. We
,ugiht not to rest oursecurity on the ad
verse omens of the crop, which is now
growing inder the will and dispensation
if Providence, which has already suffered
imt many quiartere from an intense drought,
and in others from the ravages of the in
sects at) destructive to its growth and ma
turity. We should look heyond the era
of the short sipply of the last year, and an
apprehended deficit duringihecomitig sea
son. The lessons of economical wi'sdom
belong to all seasotns, and all tines, and
there is a sialutary truth to the honely up
horisi, that those who do not take care of
thenselves, are not likely to be taken care
of by olhers. % e theref'ore submit this
call ind invitation to you, witih tite carn

TuE CIRCULAR.-If the planter has
Otton to sell atn( the manufacturer wants
it, they can trade without bank interven
ion. ifthe Bank of Englhnd depresses
lie price ofmanufactured cottons-so that
to pay high prices for the raw material
vould ruin the manufacturer-can the
planter compel the manufacturer to high
.r prices by holding back his crop-or is
be tnot bionid and in the end compelled
to share with his customer the evil of the
tes! Besides. no coinbintition here to
inch the ntufacinrer, nill bring the
Bank of England to terms. Are not the
'lanters safer in diing their own business

embtark, sink or swim, with all our speco
lators ? Let us do our old safe busi
ness, anid let those only who make
haste to ho rich, experience the wo pro
unounced against it. It is intolerable that
the haste of a few, should claim the
right to put a whbole section into a jog

resbolved to do tnotmore than their regutlar
wheel work, andI will tnt he tro'ted out by
the jockies. They would rather laugh
and be fat than fuss and grow lean.
Naw Corros Cat UAIn.-We receiv
ed yesterday fromn the South. aniother Cot
ton Circular, which the reatder will find itn
aniother hart of to-day's American. It will
he seen that the atttenttioqn of the plantintg
interestsofthe South has been dlrawn to
the exisung crisis in commercial affairs in
IEugland, and the course pursued by the
Bank of Englanud. Whatever may be the
motive whlich has iniduced the present
policy on the part of foreign eapitalists or
itnstit utionis, it becomtes alike the duty oh
the Amteri--an producer to guard himself,
as far as practicable, fromt the operautioun
of circtumstances so destructive to his best
interests; and wve are free to confess that
we can see nothing objectionable in the
plan suggested in the circular, by which
we shall avail ourselves of domestic in
stead of foreign credits, in disposing of the
prodtets of our own country. Nor is there
any thinig itmproper, so far as sug~tested to
us by first impressions, in effecting, thro'
the agency of our owni motniedi institutions,
independenice of imiancial movements on
the other side of the ocean, over whlich we
can exercise no direct control. The ad
vatnces provided for under the arrange
ment, will, as tue circnlar indicates, he
entirely subject to the voluntary accep
tance of the planter, who will be at liberty
to select this or any other channel as he
may think best. If doubts be enteitained
as to the right of the American ~oducer
to take such measures in the premnises as
shall insure his own safety, we can only
say that we can see no -plausible ground
upon wvhich they can be based. As well
might it be said an individnzat has no right
to withdraw his business from~ a rfao.- in
whose agency lie lias lost confidence, ow
ing to the multiplicity of other duties, or
any cause whatever, as to say that the
A mierican growers of cotton may not de
iermine, as a regular practice, to obtain
their advances from the institutions of

The following ' comes home to our
business and hosoms." We commend it
to the attention of all those, who are dis
posed to gruniblo about the continuanceof
old and long advertisements in our co
lumns. We infirm such, that these, ar.d
the weekly ones, are the very " pabilum
vita" of a newspaper. Without them, it
could not exist. About a year since, a
person, who was not a subscriber to the
Advertiser, argued with us, that the inser
tion of advertisements of any kind in a
newspaper, was an imposition upon the
subscribers! He said, that they should he
published on an ertra sheet, and -ent gratis
to the readers!!! This is a piece of libera
lity which we will certainly not exercise.
Ours is an advertising sheet, as its name
imports, and we will give paying adver
tisements the preference to every thing
else in our paper :
" NvwsPARRa A DVERTsttG.-While
every editor nust be thattkful to a certain
portion of his subscribers, for uniform
punctuality in their payments, and. for the
kind interest which they take in the suc

lieve, that he really experiences any feel
ing of extraordinary gratitude. The pa
pers received by each subscriberein the
course of a year. cost annually more than
the price or the subscription in the mere ex
pense of material and manual lahor, and
if the editor finds aftersonling his accounts
that he has any thing left for his trouible,
it must cotme fromt the advertising cn
lumns. Persons wvho are so much sur
prised to findl long advertisements of qgnack

Several commtnnications in opposition
to Mr. Van Buren, and in favor or lien
ry Clay, have recently appeared in the
Charleston Courier. This shews areat
liberality itn an Administratin paper, such
as the Courier is. Probably, many other
papers in the State, though they might not
solicit, would yet permit the introduction
of articles in favor of eitber of thbe promi
nent candid a:es, for the Presidency, in their
columns. ThiJis nothing but fair: Tern.
perate and well-written essayvs on either
side, of the great Presidential question,
should not be excluded, merely because
the editor differs from the writer. Though
the propriety of this course appears so olh
vious, still we. believe, that a different
practice prev.tils with many editors. They
are nothing httt mere partiana, and shut
their eyes to every thing which militates
against their own opinions. This is to
~e condemned:- but let it not be inferred,
that we disapprove of bold and honest
partisanship in any editor, wvhenever the
public good may senm to him, to require
it. If he believe in the truth of any prin
ciple, or vital political measure, let him
battle for it, manfully, and: with all his
powers, though the whole world should
rise ini arms against him.
We think it a GOOD steni to see Admin
istration papers, which formerly opposed
State Rights doctrines, now advocating
them, anit laboring with their utmost exer
ions, to establish them. It looks as if the
Governmnent was returning to correct prin
ciples. -
Let the Whigs vie with the Democrats,
in the support of the cardinal doctrine's of
State Rights, and all will he well._
-'It is no uncommon occurrence, in the
presetnt day, to read articles on State Sove
reignty and State Rig/as .in the colutmns
of political journals which, a few years
ago, were devoted-to the propagation tand'
support of ptrinciples diametrically oppo
site, and the Editors of which, with-Mar
tin Van Bn,~ Hen. lair. antd Daniel
Webster,, were prepared to trample the
rights of a-sister State into the dust, to ia
rade her territory teith the hired soldiery of

From the suljoined, it seems that the
Mammoth, fteal Estate Lottery," of

We are puzzled to know, what to think
liout it. Let it be what it will, we wash
yur hands ofit:

PUBLIC MEETING.
At a large and respectable meeting of
he young men of----, and its vicinity,
t the Court House, on - instant. Felix
Porter, Esq., was called to the chair; and'
H. C. Cigar, Esq., appointed Secretary.
After an eloquent and appropriate ad
Iress from the Chair, explanatory of the
)bject of the meeting,
Big Quid Cavendish, Esq., read the
ollowing preamble and resolutions, which
ere unanimously adopted:
" Whereas, having seen in the la'st Ad.
iertiser, a satire on chewing tobacco in
hurch, and an appeal made to the ladies
n behalf of a society against it; we take
nto considerhtion the importauceibf the'
lubject, as affecting our vital interests.'
Whereas, the habits of cheving and-smok
ug tobacco, exert an evil and pernicious
endency on the prosperity of the present
and rising generation; and whereas the
labits of tight lacing, and wearing tour
reures, detract from the".health and
beauty of the ladies, we, with'the co-opera- 0
ion of our fai-er neighbors, will form a so
iiety to do away with these abbminable
vices ; therefore,
. Resolved, That our.Society bestyled
the Anti-Bachelor, Anti-Old-Maid, Ant
Tobacco, Anti-Liquor, Anti-Tourneure
and Tight-Lacing, and Anti et iiater
Society.
"2. Resolved, That if the ladies will dis
pense with their stays and tourneures, in
imitation of the Venus de Medicis, we,
the young men, will chew no more tobac
c, smoke no cigars, drink- no liquor, and
be no -longer bachelors from this time
orth and forever.
"3. Resolved, That the ladies, who ap
prove of this society, will 'signify it 'by
showing a partiality for the colours of
blue, pink, and yellow, in their choice of
ribbons, and ornamental apparel; and the
youug men who approu, shall"IooIr-iIn-..
proved in health, estate, and-spirits, frea
liaving already fallen into the ieasure." -
Mr.. Bottleneck' then' moved, " That
thie proceedings be published in the Ad
ertiser."
On tnotion -of Obadiah Pipes, Esq the
Society adjourned sine die.

The .Chevalier De G3erstner, an intelli
gent European, is now travelling in the
United' tates, making an examination of
the different Railroadls, and estimating
their e'xpenditures. He has published a
report on the subject, of which the follow
ing is an extract:
I have already pased over more than
2000t. miles of Railroads, and have every
nwbere been received with the greatest
kindness; the Presidents, Directors and
Engineers of the different Railroad lines
gave me not only all their printed reports,
bat laid before me, with the greatest liber
ality,.their books antd accounts, in order to
give me every kind of information. I ful
fil only my duty wheu I publicly acknowl
edge, that such a liberality is only to be
found amongst a free aud enlightened peo
ple, where all p)ublic works are based on
the prmnciple of publicity, and where so
eta do not exist. 1' wish, threfore, to
make rhose gentlemeb, to 'whom I am so
much indebted, another comttsunication;
which will ahow at tt-e same time what
has been done during the last years in
Europe. Having within a few days re
ceived the last Reports of the Belgiunr
Railroads, I publish in the follpwing ab
straCt the history and progress of those
commujnications in Belgium, together with.
a comparison of them with the A merican
Railroads.
According to the fact; collected during
my travels since my arrival in New York,
there are now over three thousand miles of
Railroads completed and in operation sa
the United States ; d25 Locomotives of
which the greatest number were made in
this country, run on the several.Railroad*,
and I believe, that up to the end of 1839,
the length of Railroads in the U. States
may amount to 4100 miles. The capital
expended on the Railroads now in opera.
tion is about sixty millions of dollars, orat'
an average cost of twenty thousand dollars
per mile, for which sum the" Railroads,
with the buildings, have been constructed,
and the necessary locomotives and cars
bought.
Several Riailroads have been undertaken
with insutlicient means, and the sharehol
ders found thremselves under the necessity
of emnploying the income of the first years
tn improving tIy Railroad, in building en
gine houses, &c., and purchasing locomo
tivs and cars. In consequence of this
le shareholders got dturing that time uo
dividends, but the Railroad still yielded a
good income. Other Railroads, wvhen
liihd-pi from five to ten pei cent.
inome to the stockholders ; others have
not vet paid any dividends for want of a
maiet number of passengers and 'freight.
