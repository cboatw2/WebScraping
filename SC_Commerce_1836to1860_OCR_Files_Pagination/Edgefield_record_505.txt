Abolitionism in Kentucky.-Our readers
will recollect that, during the late session
of the Kentucky Legislature, a violate de
bate took place in that body on the subject
of repealing an act prohibiting the impor
tation of slavos into that State. in which
the Clay party, with C. M. Clay anoug
them, went the whole in Abolition speech
esand sentiments. Mr. R. Wieklife %%as
one or the few of his party who made an
exception to his course, and -his exception
was a very signal one, for which he has
brought down the Clay vengeance upon
him, as is well known here. He is a marked
and doomed man, and that is well known
here. In the course of Mr. Wickliffe',
speech, he proclaimed the fact, that there
were then two Abolition papers in Ken
tucky-a fact well known there. Both
these papers are for Clay for next Presi
dent.' To show their tone, and audacity,
we give the following extract from one of
them,, published at Danville, called the
Danville Reporter
" If the signs of the times do not deceive
us, the time is come when the people of
Kentucky should call a convention and
change their fundamental law. The slave
holder must prepare himself to give up his
slaves. We have not read a speech made
in the Kentucky Legislature against the
repeal of the act of 1613, which does not
abound with maledictions upon the evils of
slavery. If these geutlcncn are represen
tatives of their constituents' feeliu.s, Kqn
tucky is at length ripe for harvest. Let
the Abolitionists of the North rejoice!
"There is but otse hope for the slave
holder left. It is either that those who ar
now clothed with power are ignorant of
the real feelings and opinions of the peo
pie, or that, knowing them, they regard
them not. If the present members of the
General Assembly truly represent the po
pular feeling upon this subject, it is use
less for us, in Fayette.to keep up the hope
less and unprofitable struggle. Kentucky
would this day abolish slavery, if a couven
lion were called. Let not t'e slaveholder
repose in the soft delusion that this cou
veation will not be called. There are
keen minds and ardent spirits in and out of
the State, who watch, with sleepless vigi
lance, these legislative indi'Stions."
- 4 4 * *
"Is it not better for the slaveholder to
risk the convention now? Is not better that
he be freed from suspense? If his property
is to be taken from him, is it not better that
he should know it, and make his arrange
ments accordingly? Is it not better that
this fierceo controversy, in and out of the
Legislature, with regard to the moral and
political sin of slavery, be brought to an
end, either by its final abolition or by fix
ing it upon the immoveable basis of con
stitutional law? These are grave ques
tions and it becomes us to look well to
them."
When such articles as these can be pub
lished in the centre of the State of Ken
tucky, it is a proof that the Editor is sure
of his protection-that he relies upon the
ruling party to protect him-and that rul
in party is one man-Henry Clay.
Equally significant is a letter from Louis
ville, of January 25ih, containing an ex
General Assembly. and which appeared
in the Richmond Enquirer a few days
ago: and which is as-follows:
Extract of a letter from Kentucky, dated
LoUlsvLLE, Jatn. 25, 18-41.
" Take my word for it, the A bolitionists
have wvon Kentucky, whether through the
success of General Harrison or not, time
will decide. A confidential letter from a
friend at [Frankfort says:
"I have had a good deal of private cons
versation with the Democratic members
here within a few, days. Trhey seemi all to
regret you have taken up the cudgels fojr
the repeal bill.* They are persuaded that
nine-tenths of the Whigs in the State, and
a majority of the Democrats are in favor
of the law of 1833, and that you can effeet
nothing with such a poor minority. Etnan
cipation is so openly avowed and main
tamned here, that the cry of Abolition has
entirely lost its force, and can tio longer re
tard the extermination of slavery in this
State. I look upon the new movement of
incorporating a Colonization Society as on
ly the entering wedge to the grand schlemne
of clearing out the negroes: the next ste-p
may be to raise a loan for that. society t)
purchase up slaves and send thetm to Li
beria. With donation, slav :s ematnepnted
gratuitously, loans and contributions frotm
British Ematncipatotrs, such a society, in
ten years, could eff'ect their object of clear
ing out all the negroes. It is impossible
nOW to stem the title."
" The letter from which the foregning is
an extract, bears date en the 24th inst.,
and is from the pen of a gentleman who
may he relied on. The Democratic mem
hers of the Legislature tell me that noth
ing can stem the tide setting against slatve
ry-and this in Mr. Clay's State! Our Le
gislature emphatically belongs to that gen
tleman. He is now anteeing for the next
game for the Presidency; and he goes sla
very in Kentucky, to win Abolition sup
port elsewhere-that is, he stakes up the
negro property of his State, to win sup
port elsewhere from Abolitionists. To de
mnonstrate that I am not mistaken on this
point, I need only mention the fact that all
the leading political friends of Mr. Clay are
open mouthed against the e il or cur-se of
slavery, and as openly advocate the sub
stitution of free for slave labor in Kentue
ky. If not immediately aroused. Ketituc
ky will go with Northern A hulitiontists, anid
for Abolition, too, in the next canvans' br
President ! Apathy for a few months lii
ger- severs Kentucky from the South, and
allies her with the A bolitionists ofthe North.
-Yours, truly,"
This letter is authentic, and contains
matter which should arrest the at tention of
every slave-holding State and of every
friend to the Union. Its disclosures are ap
palling, and? must prepare the South for a
St. Domingo tragedy. The movement in
favor ofa colonization charter identifies the
moving spirit. It is Clay's old work-in
his first land bill-in all his old speeches
in his old gKentucky resolutioa-in all his
devious conduct years ago. We set it down
for certain that Clay will be the Abolition
Bilto r-epeal the act prohibiting thme impor
candidate for President in I844; and we {r
vish '1'iend :and foes to'write this predic- I f
ion dowi, aud cwpare it with. the fact i
*ben the time comes. To those who think v
that his late speech against the Abolitiaa- a
ists will form any obstacle to his joining F
that faction it is only necessary for them f
to i-emember the course of his life, and see I
that no speech, or speeches, no previous I
course, or previous prinicipls, or pledges, c
or promises has ever been an obstacle, for c
an instant, when a calculation of interest t
excitod him to change. Witness his Unit- I
edl Stattes Bank change in 1816-his John I
Quincy Adam" change in 1824-his tarill t
change in 1832-his military chieftain e
change in 1836-his four years Presiden- e
tial trn change in 1840-his pre.,ent posi
tion at thu head of ihe Federalists, whom
the first twenty years of his public life was r
spent in comlbauing-his adjournmnct,;ihe
die, of the famous J. Q. A. challenge and i
defiance on the delicate question ol, etc. t
etc. etc. To any who doubt of the Aboli- I
tion position of' Mr. Clay in 1844, let them (
recollect the changes of position he has al
ready made; and that the Presidency is t
the thing that he is after, nud, to ahiai it, r
he is ready to desert or to jin any mant,or <

WHAT IS TitE IREMEDY!
Times are very hard, and every one
seemus fully sensible of it. The question is
frequentiy asked, What is the remedy?
Experience has taughit us that labour and
econuty are the only sure romedies; for
when the people depend most upon the
Banks, to serve themi, they are sure to be
tie most disappoinmed. But it will take
lime. with laiour and economy, to clear
the country of debt; andil the grand ques
tion is what meanis should be adopted that
will be promptly beneficial to the coun
try ? The people are indebted to each other
and to the Banks; and as there appears
to be a general necessity of settling tip
forthwith. I would recommend all the
forbearance possible, and then cast about
for some remedy for those who are urged
by the laws of the country to the paymento
of their debts. The greatest evii in our
country. next to the indebtedness of the
people, ia the t normous amount of money,
paid in the shape of fees to public ollicers
for collecting debts. I am not one of those
who believe that officers should not receive
a fair compensation for the amount of la- I
bour they are required to perforta; but I
believe the Judiciary tsystem of our State
is cut up into too small parts. The Coun -
ty Court system, so at-ongly recommend- 1
ed by Governor McDuffie, did not inert
the approbation of the Legislature; neith
er, perhaps, would it suit the convenience
of the people; the great objection, and the
only essential one to that system, being the
expense and inconvenience of attending at
the Court House on every occasion, when
Magistrates, distributed all over the Dis
trict, would answer the purpose. We want
the benefits of the system, without the ex
pense and inconvenience, and the. object
of this communication is to point out a
plan which I think would answer, and I
submit it to the people for their considera
tion. It is this:
That Magistrates be compelled to hold
their Courts peiodically-say monthly;.
ua any Uluw1 muJu, tes r tuse, so as G b O
near that amouni and abolish the Summa
rv Process DickFt in our Courts. Make
tie Constables electIve; reduce the num
ber botth of Magistrates and Constables;
reqiire summtons to be served 15 days be
fore the sitting of' the Court, unless the
plaintiff' makes affidavit that he is in dan
ger of losing by the delay, w'hen a sfpecial
Court catn he had anad thu debtor be requnir
ed to answer forthwith, or etnter inato re
cognizance for his appearance, as may be
deetned most suitable ; the defetidatut to lbe
alowed five days to fille a dlefeuce and de
mawnd a jury, if lie wishes one. If howev
er, he enters a defenice, withotut demntditng
a jury, notice of the tnature of the defence
might be served forthwith upon the plain
tidf, atndl if he wished maight demandl a jury ;
the expenses, of course, to be paid by the
unsuccessful piarty ; the jurors to rec-eive
no coimp tusation. 1i might be objected
that meni wouild niot like to serve in the ca
pacity ofjturors without compensa tion; but
he sav'ing. to the cotmmunity wounld mor'e
thatn cottpetisate them for that service. I
wounld hurther provide, that the privilege of
a jury shouitt not be granted unless the de-.
maund exceeded t wenty dollars, as hereto
fore; anid ii might he proper to have a se
paratte docket f'or cases uder that sum. 1
The time of service, andl mode of trial, in
such cases, to be as heretofore. The Court
to be tine of recourd, in all in-'tances, so that
executions wvould bind prouperty. 1 would 1
further provide that execution on any sum
over twenty dollars, should not isstte for
sixty days (or any other named time so as
not to make the system oppressive,) after1
judmenut given with the privilege of an ap
peal to Court, as heretofore.
I will now try to give some of wvhat I
coceive the advantages to he derived from I
such a system. It the first place, at a fair
coapesation to all the officers io.,cerned, I
when no jury is required, the cos~t of ma- I
tuing an execution would not exceed thre-e I
dollars, while at presetnt, the ctust otn Stain. I
Pro. cases, is from seven to ten dollars.
Another adlvatntage is that buy relieving the I

csity of tu'etein~g tilmin1,1 fie very lowest
charai-ers filling that oflice, which of itself
is a disgr-ace to the present systema.
I think men will see, with a little re
lectiotn, that the requirement to serve ase
jurrs, is not so burthetnsome as at first
sight would appear: for itnstance, while a
man may be reqtuired to serve as a jurr
in January, it may be his misfortune to he '
sued in February, ar'd in that case, he saves *
in costs from five to seven dollars by the c
system, which far more than compensates I
him for the service rendered as a juror. L
He would also have less time to serve ass a

A Question of Vraiye.-,t may be re
meinbered that Lord Palmerston, some
time ago, on the Boor of the House of Com- 1
mons, declared that the- assumption. of re- 1
sponsibility for the attackupon the Caro
line had been officially made known tothe I
Government of the United States, through
Mr. Stevenson, the U. S. Minister at the
Court of Si; James. In reference to this
declaration .the. London Times makes the
statement following:
,We are saxious to enforce the expedien
cy of getting at the truth of a rumor which
has been accredited in the best informed
circles, and-of which we see no reason to
doubt the truth-namely, that within a
day or two after Lord Palmerston assured
the House of Commons that he had ihree
years ago, informed Mr. Stevenson of the
British Government having sanctioned the
destruction of the Caroline, the American
Minister, Mr. Stevenson addressed him
self by note or words to the British Forei'gu
Secretary, 'positively alleging that his
Lordship had stated what was not the fact,
for that the American Government had
never yet had such a communication from
any official functionary of Great Britain.
The whole corps diplomatique now in Lon
don have, we understand, been fully ap
prised of this matter, which reflects grave
ly upon the character of a British Secreta

A New York whig paper, (the Hcrald)
says that "Thomas Ewing, the head of
by a mean, dirty, vulgar, party spirit, than
elevated sentiments or the public good."
A Correspondent of the New York
Herald says:
Mr. Ewing is preparing a plan for a
modification of the tarilf, to be submitted
to Congress at the extra session. H e pro
poses to lay a duty of 20 per cent on silk
goods from beyond the Cape of Good
Hope, and 10 per ccent on French silks.
This is inverting the natural order of
things, and inisolves a positive absurdity.
If there is any discrimzination, it should ob
viously be in favor of, the goods brought
fromt the most remote point. The dia'er
ence in the cost of the voyage is nearly
10 per cent against the India silks. Mr.
E wings, project is to impose a sufficient
duty on wines, silks and some other arti
cles of luxury, to meetuhe current demnatnds.
upon the revenue, and provide for the Ii
qttidation of the public debt, which is to
be funded. His estimate is that ten mil
lions will cover the liabilities of the gov
ernent until the operation of the new
tariff shall increase the supply. There
will be five millions of outstanding Treas
ury notes, and Mr. Ewing cotnputes the
amount of deferred appropriations at five
mtillior.. more. The estimate is conjectu
ral entirely, and will proibably be found to
fall short of the facts in the case.
Fears are entertainmed here by some of
the friends of the Ad ministration, that Mlr.
Ewing will be found unequal to the du
ties of Secret ary of the Treasury. He is
a laborious, persevering man, wvell fitted
for the ordinary routine and drudgery of
the Departmtent, but it is not supposed that
he possesses that practical kntowledge of
the subject of finance and currency, those
large and comprehensive views, that fa
miliarity with the philosphy and laws of
commerce and trade, which are indispen
sable in the head of the Treasury, at this
important and critical juncture.
As the notion put forth in the following
paragraph in an odd one; it probably ori
gutlated with Mr. Adaums himself. The
idea is capital, whoever started it. We do
not think the Government could do any
thing better with Mr. Adams, than to send
him to China. His going would do an
amount of guod on this side of the world,
thbat no mischief he could breed among 'he
Antipodes could outweigh. He certainly
is enmitled to meet the Emperor on eqlual
terms. He must let his nails grow, for he
will be a lion among the Chinese philoso-I
phers; and his advent will mark an era.
Commodore Elliott is probably a relation i
to the British Commander, who took a
palpitation of the heart lately, and it were
well to commission him to carry out Mr.1
Adams. Our Commodore would make
quite a sensation among the junks. Send
them both, by all mneans.

Convenience of Bank Notes..-The great re
irgument of the paper-mongerse s the cob- pa
renience or bank notes to travellers, and p
nerchants making remittances. This-may .
>e exemplified in -the idventutesof a little Pu
Frenchman which we remetaber to have St
;een many years ago ina pleasrut story, ge
)ow out of pilot and forgotten.
He came, if we recollect aright, from H'a- $1
tanna. with a bag of doubloons, which he lu
Jeposited in a bank atSavannah, and was kv
advised, '-for convenience sake," to ex- ex
:hango them for bank notes, in order tha' ad
ie might not he incommoded by the weight
)f his gold. He travelledNorth by land,
iis object being to see the cdbntry : and the P1
irst time he had occasion to dispurse his T
totes, was a little supprised to find they foi
tad depreciated two or three per cent.- p
rho further he went, the greater the de.
reciation until his surprise became astun- S
shment, and his astonishment dismay.
*At Now Yorkibe depreciation was from at
twenty-five to thirty per cent. and at Bos
ton they would not take his money at all. .
"Sacro, "exclaimed the little Frenchman. :
, vat! you call dis 'convenience ?' Diable!
it has turned all my doubloons into one dam
good-for nothing shine plasters." Com- W,
plaining to a friend, he was advised to th
travel hack again, when the table would be ti<
turned, and he might recover all the pre- .
miums he had paid. "Sacre blue!" cried "
the little Frenchman in a rage; "I travel bi
back again? Diable! Where will I get m

A Disappointment.-The abolitionists
boasted, while Gen. Harrison was a candi
date for the Presidency and after his elec- N
tion, that no.slave-holder should ever asain re
be President of the United States. Presi- pi
dent Tyler is, we learn, a slave-holder. in
whose election the abolitionists were instru
mental. The abolitionists will learn that U
there is a Power that can over-rie the w
wild spirit of fanacticism, as well as disap- A
point the ambitious aspirations of crafty O
and dishonest politirians.-Raleigh Stand.
The late Forgeries.-From statements
in the last N. Y. Papers, it appears proba. th
ble that the vaiious cerifiicates of depo- sv
site sold in that and other cities were in sa
part genuine, and that the forgery consis
ted in substituting large for small amounts.
Otherwise, it is nearly certain that some t
of the officers of the Commercial Bank at
New Orleans are participant of the fraud.

The following extract from the Presby- si
terian Advocate, published in Pittsbturg, ,
shows what bitter fruits the negroes pluck
from the tree of abolition :
" There are 25,549 negroes in the city 0s
and country of Phailadlelphia. A house of te
refuge for colored children is proposed.- ic
There are 50,000 negroes in the State. Of
every nine convicts in the Eastern Peni-.
r entiary in 1831, four were negroes. of eve
ry inte in 1841, 7 were blacks! This is Ia
an alarming disproportion, considering the cc
fewness of the blacks."

Mr. Editor.-I send you the following, nI
which will no doubt be of conisiderable in- C
terest to all farmers. In the spring of
1825, Mr--of--District in this State,
was very much pestered with rats. They re
collected in stuch ntumbers about his barn
andi statldes, as t o give. at a distance, the
sound of a parcel ofpigs in the shocks, &c. F
They destroyed nearly twenty bushels of fc
corn and peas before any stratagem could
be fallen upon to destroy them : at length
he was told by a friend that the Jasmuine fu.
blossom wo-uld effectually take them all
away. Accordingly a liarge quantity of o
rines and blossoms were procured and
thrown in the corn house, stables, &c. and
in less than two weeks there was not a ratt
r mouse to be heard un the place. These P
lossomrs have quite a pleasant and agree- ota
uble smell, but are very poisonous This sa
