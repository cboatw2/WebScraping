Our gn1J spirited youth. at
every call far their ervices. voluntarily
rushed to eneastier ir, the cause of hu
inanity, andvT -pariotisn, all the perils
and privations ofa campaign, so fruitless
of the ordinary'glories of war, and where
the endurance of toil aid sufferiug, ansI
famine end disease, were the only con
quests and trophies, their valor could
achieve. Submittipg to these, with a for
titude and cheerfulness never surpassed by
any -,oldiry-incurring expenses, lo4es,
and deprivations. which were felt by all,
and by which many have been impoiver
ihed-the patriotic sympathies a the
State were readily induced to anticipate
the slow and tardy jetstice of Congress, by
advancing the amount of more than tweu
ty thousand dollars, to discharge that por
tion of their claims which nas ascertained,
upon the strictest investigation, aid 11hC
bct cntemporaneous evidence, to be jueset,
idisputable. and necessary to the se'rvice.
But a vvry small part, if any, of this ad
vatnce, as I am informed, has yet been re
funded: and I therefore recommend the
immediate appointieut of a cottipetent
agent to effect a peedy and equitable ad
ju.tmient of this claim, which. so long d;
