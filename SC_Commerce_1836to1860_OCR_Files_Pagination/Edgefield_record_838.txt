PALMETTO FIRE COMPANY.
.The 69th Anniversary of our National
Independence, was celebratetd in a spirit
ed andl becoming manner by the PALIIsv
-ro FsiE Esotas CourAr,4ef Edge
field.
At3 o'clock P. M., the Memnhers of the
Company assenibled in front of their En
gine House, and immediately after their
formation marched to the Baptist Church.
As the Company entered the Church, the
Edge~eld Band of Music, which was seat
ed in the gallery,.- played an appropriaae
air. As soon as thte music hiad ceased, the
Rev. Dr. Johnson arose and addressed the
throne of Divine Grace. in a solemn and
impressiveWmanner ;after which the De
claratiop of Independence was .read by
Mr. H. R. Murray, Chief Engineer of the
Company. As Mr. Murray closed, the
band again played a national air, after
which the Orator of'the day, Capt. C. A.
*Meigs, entertained the' audietnce for the
space of about forty minutes, with a neat
and patriotic Oration, which was well re
* ceived, and which' was not only creditable
-to its author, but, to the Company general
Ifly. The orator's remarks to the mnembers
of the Company, in the introductory part
64o1isoration, were peculiarly appropriate.
'.We would like very much: to see the-ora
ti'on ii print."4 As' the speaker, clased, the
bad -again played, anter which the Rev.
*Dr.'Johnson pronounced a benediction,
aod'thie Company returned to. their En.
giue House and was dismissed.
At half past four, the Company, togeth
er-with a number of invited guests, sat
down to ~an excellent Dinner. prepared
for the occasion, by the worthy host of the
Planters -Hotel. C. H. Goodman, "E-sqr.

BARBACUE TO MR. McDUFFIE.
It is with feeliig' of pleasenre'and pride. that
we publish to-day, the invitation to the Barbe
cue, which is to be given.to Jiy. MAcDUFFIE.
by. a portion of his formet-constituentas. We
regret that more time wasi6t allowed to extend
he invitation. There nay be ame, we fear,
deprived of this intellectual treat,;by not know
ing that Mr. McDuffie is to address the people
on the occa sion. We, therefore,-rge upon all
who receive our paper tY extend tie infornia
tion to their neighbours. In tiis connexion we
deem it proper to say that the shortness of the
notice was unavoidable-Mr. McDuffie himself
having appointed the day. -Nor in he to blame ;
for though the people of Old Edgefield have
srong claims upon him. they mitat rementber
that his time is not hisaown. He has other, and
perhaps, more import engagesu:etuts to fulfil,
Tennessee and Georgia are yet to be converted,
and there is "old Rip"-asleep again. Ini those
States, his services -arc needed, and we must
sare him,
We are assured that preparations are making
fir the largest Barbecue ever given In this Dis
trict-all are in invited- let all come. We
know that the people have not only entire'coii
fidence in Mr McDuftlie's auperior intellect
and sound judgment; but also in his perfect.
purity and sincerity. They know hIimi to he
incorruptible, and they, therefore, believe him.
le wants no honors nor offices, that are in the
gift of the 'government. What motive then
can he have to betray or deceive us? He is es
sentially one of its, He has never w-ide poli
tis. a trade, and to this nmy be attributed the
unbounded influence which lhe thi' day pousses
sea over the public mind of South Carolina.
When such purity of character, is combined
wiih tbrilliant genius, clear discriminationa, and
sound judgment,- too much ieliance cannot he
placed in the opinion of the person posses-gin
it. We shall await, therefote, wvith eager anx
iety, the arrival of the day appointed for his
speech, and when it does arrive, we shall go
prepred to beliese achise hear.
Our immediate Representative Mr. Burt has
been specially invited to attend and speak on
that occasion. As a lawyer, his ability is well
known to us-we shall then, for the fist time,
view him as a politician, and we predict, con
idetly, that he will equal the most sanguine
expectations of his warmest and most enthusi
astic admirers.
His Excellency, Governor Hammond, has
also been invited, and it is hoped that he will
attend and address the. people. Brave and
talented as lie undoubtedly is,'and true to the
State as he now -is. and always has been, it
can not but be a-matuer of deep interest to the
people to knowv his views at this cri'is
The Hon. Langdont Cheves is also expected
to be with us. Thongh but little known of
late years'to the political 'world, he must ever
be ranked among the most gifted oflCaroli
na's gifled sons.. What Carolinian can ever
forget this oneo of the "illustrious triop?" And
can the associate of lowndes and Calholn re
main inactive whilst "eSouthern rights are to.
be strictly maintained,'and Soiuthern wrongs
esisted at every hazard ?" No!
03T Achilles must, lease his tent.
The presence otths#ion Daniel E. Huger,
our ether distingighsed tionator,hias been re
qested alho, and w hope that the people will
not be disilppointed, in their..expectation of
seeing him. That: Judge' Huger there is no
one of these eminent men whose 'sentiments
woul ba listened to~ivith' moi-e 'intense anx
iely, or whose opinions would carry. more
weight.
The people of this= District will be.gratified
to learn that Judge Butler is also au invited
guest. The opportunity of listening once more
to his fervid and vigorous elonqence, would of
itself, command a general concourse of the
citizens of this District.
Temperance Conrenion.-The Temperance
Convention of the State of South Carolina,
will meet at Edgefield Court House, on Wed
nesday the 31st instant.
Many ofthe distinguished advocates of the
principles of Total Abstinence will be present
on that joccasion, from this, and the adjoining
States; and all who desire to hear the subject
ably and fully discussed. will do well to em
brace the opportunity. It will be a time full of
interest to the good cause, and it is hoped will
be attended with great and lasting good, in
promoting the cause of Temperance, prosperi
ty, and happiness throughout the land.
We have a hope, that our citizens will, with
their accustomed liberality, throw open wide
their doors, to receive with a hearty welcome,
all, who shall give our village the honor of their
company, during the time of this benevolent
meeting.
New Books.,-Mr. E. C. Reemer, of this vil'
lage, Agent fur a number of periodicals, has
presented us with copies of the following new
publications, which, from the hasty glance we
hava giveu them, we pronounce Is considera
bly interesting:
" The Life of James Knox Polk. Esqr.," the
Democratic candidate for the office of President
of the United States.
" The Martyr Wife," a Domestic Romance,
by the author of " Hiram Elwood, the Banker,
or. like father like son."
" Rose D'Albert, or Troublons Times,' a
Romance, by G. P. R. James, Esqr."
Mr. R. keeps constantly for sale a great va
riety of the newest Novels.
Augusta Washingtonian.-The publisher of
this valuable Temp.: anee Journal, ro-com.
nences the publiction of it on Saturday next.
We invite the friends of Temperance to come
forward and throw in their mite in support of
this Journal, which has, since its establishment
done much in furthering the advancement ojf
the good cause in which it has been engaged,
in our district.
Texas and France -The Charleston Patriot
says: " It is rumored that Despatches came out
by the Steamer from the French Government,
upon the subject of Texas annexation Oneof
the French papers, the Seicle. says, it wishes
. Texas to be independent, under the protection
ofFranceasacounterpoise. or curb for Mexico.'
From Mexico.-The latest accounts from
Mexico, appear to be rather of a hostile nature,
Santa Anna talks loudly of retaking Texas,
and has called upon the government for about
four millions of money and 30,000 men to ac
complish his purpose. He says:
" So soon as the money may he voted, that
troops shall be put in motion; but as it would
be necessary, if hostilities commenced this sea
son, as the President desires to withdraw troops
from points in the interior important to be
guarded, he makes the further requisition of
30.000 men to be stationed at these points.
" He protests strongly that these reqisitions
are made with no personal view of aggrandize
ment- The President asks for no extension of
powers, but only for means ofexercising the
powers already delegated to him, and so to pre.'
serve intatct the honor, dignity and integrity of
the Mexican natioti,'
"Such are the principal features of the pro
jetl now before Cong~ress. In the nmeantimne
there are maniy whmothiuik that a mtajority of the
members will not vote for the appropriation of
$4000,000. Should such be the case, it is
confdently expected, so anoxious is Santa An
na to raise themoney, that he will dissolve the
Congress, send home the members, and then
issne an order for a forced loan, ot else adopt
some other measture to carry otnt his schemes.
The next arriyal from Mexico will probably tell
the whole story."
0- By the Steamer Great Western, advices
have heen receiyad, at Newv York, trom Liver
pool, to the 22d ult.. The N. Y. Hemald.of the
7th inst. states, that the intelligence received
y the Steamer, is not of the highest import
ance, being only three days later than that re
ceived by the Britannia, except as far as Cot
ton is concerned, which article has advanced
full one-eighth. The following extract of a let
tr received ini Charleston, and published in
the Patriot of the 10th inst., -should, at least.
give onr Planters a hope, of better prices:
LIVER'OOL, .Iune 21.
Simuktaneouslj with large arri'als oft Cotton.
as is not unfrequently the case, an extensive
demand has prevailed daily throughout the
week, and the marke't closes at abont 1-8d per
lb. advance upon -onr .quotatioiis. This im
provement has shown itssif moat decidedly ini
the middling and middhitng fair qualities gene
rally, and most especially in Orleans and Mo
bile, which. notwithstanding'the large stocks
on hand, offer in very -limited quantity Hol
ders are exposed to such immense losses, that,
looking to the state of trade in the country-to
the certainty that the present crop as a maxi
mum-will not exceed two million ofbalee-and
to the possibility and even the probability of the
coiing crop not exceedi'a the same quantity
-they see no cause for apprehension, and no
motive to indne them to make sales excepting
at higher and gradually improving rates. .The
pat teaches caution in raferenCe to predictions;
but had- even the real extent of the present
crop heen known in the earlier part of thieyear,
there is hardly any one that does not saippose
prices would'havebeen higher than they nowv
are. A series of dfsappointment and,. general
uncertainty have more shaken confidence, and
more depressed the market than any probable
large estimate of crop could have dune had it
at once been fairly stated."
Rise in the Misausipp.-The Cincinnati
Daily Advertiser, states, that the river onthie
23d ult., was thirty-eight feet two inchtes plumb
above low water mark, and this was seven feet
to inches above the curb stone of the market
in St. Louis. In Citicinnati the height of tho
water above the low water mark, was about
sixty-one feet ! One of the scenes which this
tremndons flood of water has produced is thus
depited in the St. Louis Republican:
"A gondleman yesteriday gave us a vivid
description of the effects oaf the flood in tdie
Sad H ill prairie, lying in Ray county, ble
tween Camden and Lexington. 'On one of the
hihest of the hills. which are -scattered over
th..rairen whisch he-went to last Snnran in a
canoe, trtet a laborious trip ngainst a power

as that contained in Noah's ark:ten.omen,

even reptiles. (for they killed a" copperheid
while he was there.).wete gathered together lit:
fellowship by the instinct of'self-preservaon,

of the frightened cattle, the neighing of the hor+

and tame. all seeming to have forgotten the
habits of Nature, ntid looking to the human
counretance for safety; the deep anxiety ated
agitation of the rational portion of this singular
congregation on the Sabbath, and amid that
wild scene of desolation. lef) an impressidn of1
his mind (our informant says) which he will
not soon forget, but which it is not easy to des
cribe."
917 The citizens of Philadelphia are again
arrayed against eath other in a civil war. In
consequence of a number of muskets -having
been found in a Catholic Church, where they
had been deposited by consent of the Governor
of the State, and the Mayor of the city, to ena
ble the members of the Church to protect their
property, during the recent disturbances. a
mob, of some thousands, collected in the vicin
ity of the Church, for the purpose, no doubt, of
laying it in ruins, as they had one or two in
their former outbreak. The Mayor and Shet
i, after doing all in their power to disperse
the mob, called to their assiEtance the military,
who, after they had used all their endeavours,
peaceably, to disperse the mob, (having been
hardly pressed upon, and abused whilst in the
execution of their duty,) they were ordered to
fire upon the mob, which order was promptly
obeyed, -fter having given the mob a sufficient
time to have dispersed, which they persisted
in refusing; the firing, thus commenced. was
returned by the mob. and in the skirmish a
number of both parties were killed and wound
ed. The city, by the last accounts, had be
come somewhat quiet, the Sheriff and the mob
having come upon terms of a peaceble charac
ter. the mob promising to lay down their arms
and disperse, provided that the civil, instead of
the military nuthoirty, took possession of the
Church. Upon consultation with tho4overn.
or of the State, the commanding general, and
the Mayor of the city. the Sheriff complied
with tho terms of their truce, and ere this, we
presume the citizens nave been enabled to re
sume their business which had in a measure
been stopped. The number of killed and woun
ded in this outbreak, amounted to about fifty
Counterfeits.-The Charleston Mercury of
the 9th inst, says:-" We are requested to call
public attention to the fact, that there are in
circulation counterfeit. twenty dollar notes, of
the Batik of Georgetown, S. C. The spurious
bill exhibits as vignette, a representation of the
Bank of the United States at Philadelphia; the
Bank of Georgetown has no such plate; the
vignette on the genuine bill, is Commerce, re
presented by a female figure, seated, and a
ship in the distance. The Bank has never used
any other plate than this, for bills of that de
nomination, since it went into operation. The
counterfeit in question, is signed D. L. McKay.
Cashier, W. Coachman President, the imita
tion of the Cashier's signature is good, but that
of the President is badly exceuted and evident
ly by the same hand."
For te Advertiser.
Mr. EnIvot--Yon are requested to give the
following, which was read beforc the Ministers'
and Deacons' Conference of the Edgefield
Baptist Association at its late meeting by Wil.
lianm B. Johnson.
By order of the Conference,
W. B. JOHNSON, Chairman.
July 13,1844.
To the Ministers' and Deacons' Meeting of the
Edgefed Baptist Association.
DEAn BRETHEN -In compliance with your
request.I now p resent ani aunswer to the follow
ing query: -"eu Christ pray for sinners, or
for believers only ?"
The following Scriptures will throw light on
the subject. " When they, (the Jews) were
come to the place, which is called Calvary,
thtere they crucified him (Jesus) and the nale
factor's; one, on the right hand, and the other,
on the lelt. Then said Jesus. Father, forgive
them, for they know not whtat they do " Luke
xxiii. 33, 34. "I pray for them;t (my disci
ples ) I pray not for tie world, but for them
which thou hast given me: for they are thiine."
". Neither pray I for these alone; but for them
also which shall believe on me through their
word." John xvii., 9, 20.
Inm the first quotation fromi the New Testa
men:, we learn that Jesus prayed for sinners of
the vilest character,. and who were about to
perp~emrte upon himself the moat altrocious'
wickedness. This is in perfect keeping with
his intercession, as mediator on behalf of guil
ty men-as the lamb of Goed, that taketh away
the sin oh the world; of that world which is
Father so loved, as to send him his otnh begot
ten son into it, that whosoever believeth in hum,.
shonld not perish, biut have everlastin'life.
On the same principle, his-Apostle thus ei
presaes his desire to his .son Til.nothy:A I sa
hart, therelore, that first of all, supplications,5
prayers, intercessions. and giving of thamks be
miade for all mna: for Kings, and for all .mndI
that are int authority, that we may lead 'a quiet'
life in all godliness and..honesty, 'for'stisi
good and- acceptable in the sight of Gad our Ba,
vior; who will have all men to be' saveid,:and
come unto the knowledge ofthe'trth.". nT.m
ii. 1-4. -
From the second quotation we learn, t sat
Jesus p rayed specially -and .definitely for his
A postles. and for all that should believe-o
him through - their word; He did 'not. h,
thus praying for his people, pray fortIe q
converted, "- I pray not for the world i~btfor
them, which thou hast given me.'' Ht puil.
