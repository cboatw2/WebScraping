E NCOURAG ED and stinmlated by the kind
and flatering so.icitntions of poltical
frienus and anl all-absoirbing interest in the gre..t
'question of the day. the undersigned (ortnmerly
editor of ite Augusta Chronicte.) prjose., :o
pubash a new paper, in Colmimlan, aid respect
Pfully -submits to the coniderattaui of the abije,
the' principles and 4pio.ions by w hich it %% iol be
goverued. Firmly conas inced that the ltature
liberty. happiness, independence and prospeliN
'o'thte Southern States, and indeed of the w hole
Contederacy, are vitall involved in the imnemen
tons qulestion now pend g, between a gagaitat:
National Bank, and the constitutional cli en vc
of the coutty, the maini object et the CAROLINIAN
witI be to dia-ussthat qtuestion freely & thoae olgt

-anai violent y inio.icat to free trade- and industr
the libertiesof the coutitry, and especiall i.'
trade, commerce, and prospe-rity olithe Sopiiet nt

once so flourisehing, and conducive to their gen.

overwheimint power and influeice ol its Mi lt
taal, ala. ci by ie irfTeltfbcredit und reoiscei. of
the Governme'nt, and a kindred system of pau
tial and unconstitutional legishaeion-thaet n e
ployment of the State Banks, as li-cal agents of
the tiovermnent, in any shaps', must be evei
more dangerous and corrupting than a Nationati
one, andl necessarily prodictive of the satne ef
fects on our Sonthern conierce. since- the great
credit and resotreestf the goveriment wouit
necessaril. be absorbed and monopolized b% t,.e
Northern Abanks. and defy all chanice eI iiir
competititn onl the part of the Southei in ones. o
Southern nierchants-- and that the onl effcintm
and permaiieit reniedy fbr these evils, ama:the
coanmerciml embarrastwents and diseiesses o'ti...
counury. is an entire I livonca of the Govagns.u-wr

over the wise and saltary provisiois of thant sn

this system as not an "experiment." but an old and
safe method successfully practised for ceituries,
by the most enlightened and civilized nations o'
the earth, till the rapidly growing power of the

deepiy involved iii rendering theose details as e r

efficient, and salutary as huniman wisdom aned
