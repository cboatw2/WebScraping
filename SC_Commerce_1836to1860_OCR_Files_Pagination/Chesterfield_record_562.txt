the Tare culture.
At a late meeting of the Philadelphia
Agricultural Society, a member enquired
if aay one prdkent could speak experiment
ally on the culture and value of the tare
or vetch, which is in such very genera
use in England, where the summer-oiliirgs
system is adopted ; remarking, thai
from all accounts the plant9 must be as^
tonishingiy productive as well as nutriti^
ous. Having m\self employed it for thai
purpose very largely, and for many years
I would say, its productiveness has nevei
jet besn overstated, or its value overrated,
as food for all kinds of cattle. Horses,
milk cows, fatting beasts, sheep and
hogs, will grow fat while feeding on it,
and the older it grows the more valuable
it becomes, as the seed when formed in
the pod, is far superior to oats or any other
grain for the purpose of cattle feed ;
the seeds are black, and the size of very
small peas. The crop is used for soiling
by cutting while green and taking it tc
thestahies; it is sometimes fed off by
shfeep, confining them on it by means of
a temporary fencing or hurdles; cattle
are not liable to become hoven while feeding
it in any state of its growth; on
good land it has been known to reach
the height of three feet and even more,
producing as much as 12 tons of green
food per acre, which, when well dried,
will yield 3 tons of the most valuable hay
on the farm.?The first sowing takes
place as soon after harvest as possible
io England, upon land designed for
the wheat-crop the next autumn, with the
winter variety of seed, which can easily
be distinguished from the summer tare, as
it is smaller, rounder, and blacker ; these
will bear the severity of the winter; rye
is often mixed to enable the crop to stand
up, when it attains a considerable height,
but a sprinklingof wheat has been found
best for this purpose, as it remains longer
succulent in the summer. The crop
from this sowing will he fit for cutting for
soiling in May, and the stalks if left in
the rround will afford a second growth for
aheep-feed ; but as the tare is a fallow
jl crop, it is the best management to cut all
off and plough the land deep as soon as
the crop is removed, well working it and
cleaning it during the summer, preparatory
to wheat-sowing, early in the autumn
after a dressing of well prepared compost,
if this has not been given to the tares?
a farbetter arrangement for bo'h crops.
The next sowing is with rhe summer var.
iety of the tare, as ear!) in March as the
AHasnn will admit, on land that has been
ploughed preparatory in the nutumn or
winter; again in April another crop is
sown, and, if necessary, two other sowings
might take place, the last so late as
the end of June, that so a succession of
this most valuable crop might be secured
for the whole of the summer, and until
the end of September. Such crops produce
immense quaniiti?\> of manure, which
is earned from ti e sl eds ac : "omposed
for dressing othe:> ; < >;?:?,.?? :istance,

ing in the au join. It uiust not be forgotten
that the richer the land, the gieater
will he the crop of tares, and none
will pay so amply for manure; but
when the crop is very heavy, there is. less
chance of obtaining good seed, and it
that be the object, it is recommended to
tnow the first crop early for soiling, and
permit the second growth to stand for
*eed, which is sometimes a precarious
business, nothing being more uncertain; I
have purchased seed at a guinea and a
half, a bushel, and sold the next year's
produce obtained from it at six shillings
a bushel! When the price of seed is moderate,
the quantity sown is two bushels
? - ' If - ?-? ?i?hnlotror
Or IWO 1I1U tl Iia.ll per uuie, uui numvioi
the price may be, it will be repaid in the
crop, if the land be in good heart. As
much as 30 bushels ef seed per acre has
been obtained, but 15 bushels, and often
half that, is more common. Under a
heavy crop of tares, the land will be founc
perfectly clean and mellow, and will turr
up like an ash heap : and there is no qu.es
tion with me, that the crop may be raiser
with success in this country, if well cul
tivated on good land, rather stiff in its na
ture, and lying ccol.
With regard fo the value of the tare fo:
soiling, it had been calculated that tei
times more stock might be kept on then
than on any other commonly cultivatei
crop; horses require no corn or any othe
fopd, and cows give fnore butter whili
feeding on them than on any other food
whatever. It is not strange, that no leg1
ular experiment on an extensive scale has
1 yet been made on such an invaluable crop
t in this country ?
R Broken Wind in Horses,
j A great number of dessections have
proved that the cause of this disease is a
J rupture of the air vessel iu the lungs.?
The difficulty of breathing which some
$ person experience after unusual or pro1
longed effort, would seem to arise from the
f same cause, and there is some reason to
, think that the disease may be hereditary,
r This is an important suggestion, so far as
J the human race is concerned.
"Dr. Jackson fount! that of 28 persons
3 affected with this rupture of the air cells,
18 were the offspring of parents (fathers
' or mothers) affected with the same dis.
ease, and that several of them had died
from this cause. In some instances the
brothers and sisters of these persons were
i similarly affected. On the other hand
I of 50 persons unaffected with the disease,
' three only were the offspring of parents
' who had suttered trom it; wtience u 101.
lows that rupture of the air cells of the
. lungs is frequently a hereditary disease ;
a fact important to man and horse, at all
events to the breeder of the latter.

IMPORTANCE OP AGRICULTURE.'
As a practical art, involving necessarily
the existence of all other arts, and diI
rectly the uses and aids of many of them,
i the importance of the agricultural art
* cannot be over estimated. In an eco.
nomical and political view with the exceptionofthe
intellectual and moral in!
terests of the community, which are also
in some, degree in obeyance to it, it is
obviously by far the most important of all
its interests,?the department of its in
dustry which most deserves the attention
, of the patriot, the philosopher, and the
philanthropist, as the means of subsisi
tence, and comfort, and the foundation of
national wealth. Extensive as are the
, commercial enterprise and the manufaci
turing industry of Great Britain, yet her
agricultural interests far transcend them.
In France, more than one hundred and
twenty million pounds of sugar are annually
produced from the soil, where, little
more than thirty years since, not a pound
was grown; to say nothing of products
in silk and wine, which are in proportion.
It is easy to see what a stake she has in
agriculture. In China, a nation almost
exclusively agricultural, for her various
manufactures are mainly concerned in
the products of her agriculture, where,
besides her vast exports, more than three
hundred and thirty millions of people are
subsisted upon these products, we gather
some impression of the immense importance
of this art. There, likewise, the
art has been carried to a higher perfection
than in any other part of the world.
Among ourselves it would be vain, in the
present youth of the country, to attempt
to calculate the extent to which the art
is destined to he carried. The forthcom.
ing census of its agricultural products
will exhibit results, which will excite
universal surprise. An annual crop in
the Southern States, of more than 2,000,000
bales of cotton, of 249,000,000
pounds of sugar in Louisiana, of 42,000000
bushels ot Indian corn in Tennessee,
of 18,000,000 bushels of wheat in Ohio,
[ and more than 10,000,000 pounds of maj
pie sugar in New York, great as the results
appear, are yet only the steps in the progress
of this gigantic interest.
These facts show how essentially agriculture
concerns the condition of the
whole country. This interest, likewise,
, is certain to increase in an equal ratio
i with the growth of her population; and
. let her commerce be ever so extended, or
iter manutactures as numerous and improved
as invention and skill and art can
' make them, yet they must always be sub:
sidiarv to her agriculture. It is her ag.
v D O
[ riculture which freights the barks of commerce,
and drives the wheels and spindles
| of her manufactories in their rapid and
infinite gyrations. At her breasts; withi
out a single exception, the whole of the
human family are to be sustained, nourished,
and comforted.
; The perfection of agrjcuiture, as an
. I art. imolies the obtaining the greatest
amount of produce from the earth, with
i the least injury to the land, and at cost of
' labor. It has been often remarked, that
' the actual productive powers of an acre
* of land have never yet been reached.?
i Magnificent and surprising results have
1 been attained, but in no case can it be
J said, with confidence, that more might
( not have been effected. In general, the
agricultural art falls far below the condij
tion of productiveness and improvement
. which it might obviously attain; and the
. aversion among farmers to change their
established h tbits, and the slowness with
r which agricultural improvements of great
i and decided advantage extend them,
i selves, even into neighbouring districts,
I are well known and sufficiently remarkar
ble. Something of this has been owing
3 to the stationary habits of farmers, to a
I want of education, and neglect of reading
and inquiry ; and much to prejudice,
i the natural child of ignorance, against
1 scientific suggestions and the application
of science to art, which, so far as they
are concerned, is wholly of a practical
character. This prejudice against the
applications of science to agriculture, or
to what in vulgar parlance is called bookfarming%
has we confess, found some natural
encouragement in the fact, that many
persons wholly destitute of practical
knowledge and skill, have undertaken to
apply purely theoretical rules, without
regard to differences of soil, climate, natureofcrop,
and nameless circumstances
by which the application of these rules
should be varied, or might be rendered
unseasonable or futile ; and that, in truth
many persons have undertaken to make
i books, and to give directions in husbandI
ry who were grossly ignorant of its great
principles, and possessed little kaowledge
of its vanons practical details and rules.
It must, ut the same time, be admitted,
that science has as yet accomplished but
little ; and that, beyond that knowledge
which any intelligent, practical and experienced
man easily and almost neccssari*
ly acquires of soils, manures, vegetation,
and crops, little has been ascertained of
a practical value ; and the profound sc.
crets of vegetable life, or what is properly
termed vital action in vegetable organism
and growth, remain in all their original
nbtruseuess and mystery. The little success,
therefore, which scientific men have
had in their attempts to resolve and explain
them, and especially the little prac.
tical utility which has come from their
rhetorical explanations, have created,
with the purely practical, a prejudice
against such inquiries, as invincible as
it is unworthy of sensible men.
Yet it will not be denied, in this case,
that we know as much of vegetable as we
know ofanimal life. Anatomy may be
termed an exact science; it is to a great
extent matter of sensible observation and
measurement; but the operations in the
human organism, which are strictly vital,
are altogether undisclosed. We know
in truth as much how the stems and
leaves and fruit are formed and perfected
as we know how the food, which we receive,
is converted into blood, and serum,
and bile, and muscle, and fibre, and ten.
don, and bone; and we know no more.
Shall we despair of going further ? By
no means. There seems, indeed, in this
case, to be a limit of enquiry; an impassable
barrier, where human sagacity and
inquisitiveness are at once repelled ; the
darkness is intense before, above, and
around us, and the mere rush-light, which
we hold out to guide us, serves no purpose
but to render this darkness visible. Shan
we then be discouraged in all attempts at
further advancement 7 Not at all. It
may be indeed that we reached the end
of our line ; and that, until new endow,
ments are bestowed, the mind can soar no
h igher in its flight. But with equal, nay,
witli much more reason may we suppose,
that the cause of failure is not so much
attributable to the limitation or impo.
tence of our faculties to proceed further,
as to the imperfection or error of our
modes of approach and inquiry. The
philosophical mind, valuing truth and
knowledge as the highest of all attain,
ments, will never rest satisfied with pres
ent acquisitions; will regard that which
is conceivable as knowab/e ; like a vigilant
and skilful officer before a beseiged
fortress, whose direct approach is precluded,
will be continually seeking some
private or concealed mode of access; or,
like tne man in the Scriptures knocking
at his neighbor's door at midnight, and
hoping presently to be heardf or bis importunity.
The immense imporrance and value of
i. ... 1 in tuin />nan ma aan.iklo man
KIIUWIl'U^c III (ilia ^(wc uv scuuiuib
can dou!>t. If knowledge and science
are useful in any art or science are useful
in art or department of business, why
should they not be in agriculture, an art
which involves many others, and which
in its success combines the influence and
operation of more elements than any
other? It is well ascertained that certain
plants will grow only in certain situations
and under certain circumstances; that
different soils have different properties,
prejudicial to the growth of some plants,
favorable to the perfection of others ; in
some cases distinguished by an cxhuberont
fertility, in others by an almost incurable
barreness, but yet in mast cases capable
of modification, remedy or im
provement; that the operation of various
measures is various ; and that their effi
ciency or injury depends upon their con
dition, preparation, or modes of applica
tion. It is equally well ascertained, thai
by some modes of cultivation, double tnc
produce is obtained under , a diflereni
cultivation, double the produce is obtain,
ed on the same land, at the same time
placed under a progressive improvement.
It is ascertained that by the applicatior
i of gypsum, or soda or salt, or various ani
mal substances, an extraordinary produc
tiveness follows, and the crops are oilier
. trebled and quadrupled. How shall wi
?"*'
. pretend, then there is not here the most
, ample room tor the application of science
; in the resolution of these remarkable facts
i and in profiting by these remarkable
means for the improvement of the soil
i and the increase of its productiveness??
[ Separate however, from the obvious utility
of such inquiries, it is difficult to conceive
of subjects more interesting to a
philosophical curiosity than all those
connected with animal or vegetable life
and growth ; for what in nature is more
i wonderful than the birth and progress of
a human being, or the germination of a
dried seed and its advancement to the
i perfection of its uses and fruits?
i There are besides grounds of encouragement
in this case, which the philosophical
mind will appreciate. In the
ordinary course of nature there is no such
thing as accident or miracle. As far as
man's sagacity has penetrated into the
material world,?and of the spiritual
world, we know nothing but by divine
revelation,?All the phenomena of nature
are foqnd to proceed upon fixed principles
and laws, and to be the results of
nicely established and well balanced, com[
pounded, and adjusted influence and
forces. Many ol tnese operations man
is capable of imitating, and the most extraordinary
results are obviously at his
command. We cannot have a doubt,
therefore, that the most recondite as well
as the most operations of nature are all
the results of established principles and
laws. Many of these laws we have already
ascertained, and they are of daily
applicaticn and use in the common business
of life. How much further we may
proceed in this discovery of them, time
only can tell As yet we have only placed
our foot on the first step of the threshold.
It is not an idle nor criminal
presumption to seek to penetrate further
into the temple of nature, until perhaps
we may raach the Holy of Holies, where
the Creator sits enthroned in his effulgence,
and where we may adorn him in
the full blaze of truth.

Patent Office, July 10,1841.
The medicinal qualities of tomatoes
having greatly increased their cultivation,
and every new preparation of the ar.
tide is deserving of consideration. A
sample ? tomato figs'1 have just been deposited
at the Patent Office, of a very superior
quality. From the taste I should
suppose all the good qualties of the fruit
were retained. In appearance the drum
of tomatoes resembles one of figs so nearly
that they might easilv be mistaken for
the same.
t
The sample is deposited by Mrs. Steiger,
of this city, and the recoipt transmitted
with it, is enclosed for publication. It is
deeply to be regretted that since the periodicals
of the day are open to communi.

less successful.
Very respectfully, H. L Elswobth.
Take six pounds of sugar to one peck
for 16 lbs.) of the fruit. Scald and remove
the skin of the fruit in the usual
way. Cook them over a fire, their own
juice being sufficient without t e addition
of water, until the sugar penetrates and
they are clarified. They are then taken
out, spread on dishes, and dried in the
sun. A small quantity of the syrup
should be occasionally sprinkled over
them whilst drying; after which, pack
them down in boxes, treating each layer
with powdered sugar. The syrup is af.
forwards concentrated and bottled for
use. They keep well from year to year,
' and retain surprisingly their flavor, which
is nearly that of the best quality of fresh
figs. The pear shaped or single tomatoes
answer the purpose best. Ordinary brown
sugar may be used, a large portion of
which is retained in the syrup.
Value ofasues.
Professor Jackson, in one of his lectures
in Boston, in illustrating the manner
in which soils might he rendered fer'
tile, said that?'A farm within knowledge
blowing sand or pine barren, and almost
> hopeless, on which ten bushels of corn to
i the acre could scarcely be grown by the
i judicious application of ashes, had been
made to produce forty and fifty bushels to
the acre. We do not question the correctness
of Dr. Jackson's statement. Our
obsesvation has convinced us that on sandy
soil, with the exception of clay marl,
there is nothing more beneficial in the application
to such soils than ashespnnd very
fortunately, unless uncommon quantities
nf ni?tA oviata is unch enila. IftUchod are
near|y as benefiicial as unleaehed ones.?
Ashes do what lime cannot-?they render
' the soil more senacious of moisture, and
' although their action is not as prompt or
> efficient on cold sour soils, they are for
> the reason Assigned considered as valuable
i on light sandy ones- Of this fact, the
farmers of Long Island and New Jprsey
. are well aware, and in the gatheriug and
\ application of ashes find a certain sptirce of

SPECIMEN OF FEMALE INDUSTRY.
We were shown yesterday, five beauti- ,
fu! silk shawls, made of double and twisted
sewing silk, which in texture, weight and r
color, will compare with any India Shawls c
of the same material. Four of them
were a yard square, and the other, black, a
about a yard and a half square. The 1
twist was even and free from all knots, 1
and the whole skillfully and beautifully a
put together. We take pride in the fact
that they were made by a lady, and a na- r
live of Georgia. They are the hand 8
work of Mrs. Oliver W. Cox, of Henry
County, Georgia, who raised the worms, J
reeled and twisted the silk, and knotted [
the shawls. She is a pattern of female "
skill and industry to her sex, which if '
generally imitated, will be the means of

they are attractive, and help.moets in J

While speaking of domestic industry,
we saw yesterday our friend Burton of s

BONE DUST. I
An agriculturist, rendered attentive to i
the vast importance of bones for manure, I
instituted privately some comparative ex- I
periments; the results of which prove, that
bone dust acts in the cultivation of ground, I
as compared to the best stable manure, i
1st. In respect to the quality of grain, as ]
7 to 5. 2nd. In respect to quantity, as <
5 to 4. 3rd. In respect to the durability I
of the energy of soils, as 3 to 2. It produces
several collateral advantages. 1st. r
ff deafrnvs weeds. 2nd. It diminishes 14
the necessity of fallow-crops. 3rd. This
concentrated manure, or substitute] for I
manure, is more easy of conveyance, less t
laborious to spread, and can with facility t
be applied to the steepest lands, in very t
hilly countries, or in wet meadow lands

Rare Species of Stock. We yesterday a
had the pleasure of beholding an article in ^
the stock line, entirely new to us, and, a
we believe such as would be new to every
one who has never travelled the native v
land of the animal. This was a species b
of wild hog, which is a native of the v
northern, or mountaneous region of Mexico
where these were caught. They are five ^
in number, all of a color, and of that cu- c
rious, indescribable color, called "thunder
and lightning," each hair and bristle beolfm-nofolu
Klack and white to the
iii? auuiuuivij ?
number of three and four alternation of |
each color. The tip end of every hair is
black, with the exception of hair around ,
the neck, the endsdf which are white.?
They are all precisely of the same color.
The proprietor has brought them on here
for the purpose of introducing them into
common use among our farmers, and in- .
formed us that he would dispose of three
of them, and he says that the product this .
species, whon crossed with the common
stock, is a material improvement upon
both as they are both more thrifty, and
require less sustenance than our common
swine, while at the same time the flesh ]
is even more delicious than the common. .
The taste of the native hog has a sensible
approach to that of bear meat/ They
are well worthy the trouble of a mile's
walk to look at. They may he seen at .

THE WOBURNS.
A correspondent of the New York
Spirit of the Times, accompanies a cut
if a Woburn boar with the following rtaarks:
This animal was imported, from Woiorn,
in England, and is considered by
nany judges of stock, to be the finest ape*
imen of swine in the United States.
Two members of the Committee, to
1 ward prizes on stock at the last Fair of
he American Institute, informed me since
hat they considered him a perfect animal,
ind could not point out a fault.
By the way, these two gentlemen, are
iot interested in any particular breed of
twine.
His measurement at 22 months old,
vas 7 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 2 inches
n girth, and 2 feel 81*2 inches high; and
le was supposed to weigh nearly seven
mndred pounds.
From the great difficulty of obtaining
twine of this breed in England, few have
>een imported, and they are not extensive
y known in this country. ; .
The Complete Grazier,'(a work on lire
itock, published in Loodon) says of the
IVobprn breed, "This is a new variety, inroduced
by the late Duke of Bedford ;
ts size is large, and color various. These
iwine are well formed, hardy, kindly disposed
to tatten, attaining nearly twice the
size and weight of other hogs, in a given
period of time."
Ree's Cyclopaedia describes them as "a
lardy, well formed, prolific sort, riging
quickly to a large weight."
An importation of Woburn swine wasihade
several years since to Long Island,
md they were nearly all destroys! by the;
burning of the barn in which they were
kept.
A gentleman in Connecticut had obtained
some of that stock, and not know,
ng the name of the breed, called, them
Vorfolk thin rind; they have been crossid
with native stock, and are very cele>rated
in that section of the country.
One was slaughtered last fall, fourteen
nonths old, which weighed, when dressed,
180 pounds.
The steward of the Duke of Bedford,
ast spring informad Captain Morgan, of
he London line of Packets, that the Woturn
hogs became so fat as to be objecionable
on that account..
In this country, where Indian corn if
ised for making pork fat and setid, instead
>f barley and buckwheat, the objection of
he Duke's steward does not hold gooc,
md if any farmer does not prefer fal hogs,
le is welcome to propagate the Landpike,
,nd Alligator sort.
If any of the readers of your paper,
pish to obtain any pigs of the pure Womm
breed, they are referred to my ad~
ertisemcnt in your columns.
A considerable number of this stock
lave been forwarded to some of the
