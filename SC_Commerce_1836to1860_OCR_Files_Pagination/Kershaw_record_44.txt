. Friendship's last offices bare been paid to the |
remains of LawUVCX WtLlliM. This venerable
man was a n alive of North Carolina; but for
many year* a resident of this District, in which be
was well known, and generally esteemed for bis j
wild, benevolent, and natrarehal character. At
the commencement of the Rcvotuntionafy War,
when quite a youth, lio embraced the cause of
Freedom: and served his time in a J>ettre of Marque
and Reprisal, until the vessel was taken by
the enemy: and her crew nude prisoners of war.
Oo the cessation of hostilities, Mr. Wiiuant en
jpgrd, for a livelihood, in the management of
plantations, which business he followed tnrough
the rest of iiis life. During bis lingering end pun.
ful disease, which terminated in death, the mercy
of Frovulcnce which supplird all his earthly wants,
and the means of grace happily afforded him, were
' bis frequent subjects of discourse and gratitude.
| According to hio anxious wish, the Sacnunrntof.
; the Lord's Supper was administered to him, on his'
sick bed, in the solemn and affecting service of
, the Churth. It wasan impressive testimony to the
j value of religious ordinances, which could inspire
> the sufferer with calm and bo!/ assurances of di5
vine love; and draw forth his ardent aspirations of
faith in tho saviour's intercession for pardon and
j acceptance with God. The humble christian fell,
1 that, in himself there was nothing, which sove*^
j reign justice could find worthy of fever. His hopes
: of uiration rested on the 'divine promises, lis
1 was assured, thai tbroogh. grace, "the king of
, terrors" could hare no triumph over hint; "Yea,
though lie walked through the valley of the shadow ;
of death, be would fear uo evil." This-b'eased anticipation
was realized. With apparently very little
pain, and without a struggle he ecssed \6 be
mortal on the '271h ull. and commenced the life
eternal, in the Tid rear of Lb age. Thus full of,
Jeara, estimable in the opinion of those who knew*
im, and irreproachable' in his walks of life, be
has bequeathed to survivors the example of a man
who loved mercy, and did justice, and waikegl
humbly with his God.
