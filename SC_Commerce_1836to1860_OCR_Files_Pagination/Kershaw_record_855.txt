Esq. to the meeting, who rose and delivered an address
replete with that good schse. and iamiliar hut
apt and forcible illustration, which mark all the cflbrts
of this gentleman on the subject of Temperance.
John l>. Tillman, Esq. one of our delegates ,
to the late Convention was nejet called upon, who
favored the Society with an address seldom equal- j
led hy one of his age. It was strikingly beau- !
tiful, biKh in style and sentiment, and affords ano
thcr earnest of the distinction and usefulness to ( ]
which its author is destined#to attain. The Rev. ! (
Samuel Donnelly being then called upon by the |
President, made a few remarks, distinguished for '
that pertinence and force so peculiar to the efforts of .
this able and useful Divine, in the Temperance i J
cause. Mr. Donnelly concluded by expressing ai(
wisli to hear from the President, when itl r. h'raser ' |
arose and made one of his eloquent and spirit-stir- ,
ring appeals to the Society, over which he.ha* been >
so recently, and so honorablv(^llefo^.tir?>irig|1 and j
which we trtrst and believe, tiret with a ready res- !
ponsc from the bosoms of ail present. Upon the j s
conclusion of Mr. Eraser's address, the pledge was
submitted, and Jour new signatures obtained.

The IItpcitcll Total Abstinence Society, celebra- fi
ted its second Anniversary at Cedar Shoal Church, j t
on Friday, the 231 of August. A Barbecue was ; \
provided by the Committee of Arrangements, to | a
which the neighbours generally, whether members j s
of the Society or not, contributed. There was quite ! o
a large assemblage, supposed to be between one 1t'
thousand and fifteen hundred persons. The Indies i tl
(who are always to be found in the front rink, in ' d
any movement having for its object the amelioration j e
of the sufferings or distress of the human family.) | t
turned out in great numbers, to encourage'us in lhe 1 u
noble cause of Temperance. The Society was cal- | fr
led to order by D. G. Stinson, Esq. one of the Vice ' e
Presidents. Rev. Warren Flenkin, opened the n
proceedings with an appropriate pravi r. After r<
which th'c Rev. C. Millen delivered an address', c
which abounded with solid arguments, interspersed j \\
with some anecdotes, and was quite interesting. |,

of pleasure, and good feeling. Every thing was orr j ;i
derly, and in accordance with the character which a
our community has established-for itself, convincing ti
all that at-public meetings, as well as in private, j;
"water is indeed the best." _ *. i,
After dinner the company re-assembled at the |,
stand, where Mr. Bowman, concluded his address, y.
He occupied about two hours, and it is said by com- , (1
potent judges to lie a masterly effort. which, for v
sound argument, eloquence, and deep research, has \ j,
never been surpassed in our neighltorhpod. Owing t|
to the inclemency of the day and the lateness of the ; p
hour, when Mr. Bowman finished, no effort was a
made to enlist members in the good cause, five, t|
however, came forward and signed the. pledge.?
We have no doubt, however, but this day's proceed- I j,

The following Regular Toasts, prepared by the |,
Committee of Arrangements, were then read by Mr. I ^
James Boyd, Capt. (Jaston's band of-iuusic juayiiig . .,
an appropriate air to each sentiment. And I here ] r
take occasion to say, that Capt. (fasten, and the 1 (
members of his band, deserve the thanks and grati- ' v

MISCKLLANEOUS.
A Hunter in Extreme Peril.?The most in.
cresting hunter's story I have ever heard was'told
nc by bur host, Mr. Pcrcival, who has followed the
west chase from his youth. In 1307, he was on a
rapping expedition, with two companions, on the
Vasliitu, when they left liirn to kill huflhlo, bear,
ndthe larger game, and he remained to trap the
treams for beaver. He had not met with very
'OO.'I flint lioon wilKi.nr nuial (in- ntinnt I
wenty-fbur hours, when, turning a small bend of
tie river, ho espied an noble old male buffalo lying
own on the beach. Having secured his canoc, he '
rept sofily through a cane brake, which lay beween
the -animal and himself, and fired. The shot
'as an indifferent one, ai.d only wounded the anilal
in the side, but it roused him,'and having cross*
d the river "he soon laid down. This was about
oon, when the. animal having again grazed, was
^sting himself in a cool place. Percival now
rosscd the river in his canoe, and got into the
roods, which were therh very open and somewhat
roken by little patches of prairie land, a very frcuent
occurrence in these parts of Arkansas, where
rest and prairie of.en seem to be contending for .
ic mastery. Hut the bull, being suspicious, rose
efbre the hunter came near enough to hiin, and
>ok to the green woods. Percival
was an experienced hunter; he had killi^OtraLiiU-' d?Q?Unflaki^v
an d kuen their teinnimal,
when inlarge nerds, was"easily trtaStereo,
i, J was well aware that when alone he was somemes
dogged, and even dangerous he, therefore,
dlowed his prey cautiously for airnit a mile, knowig
that he would lie down again ere long. 1 ho
tiflUlo now stopped, and Percival got within fifty
ards of him, waKshingan opportunity to strike hitn ;
inrtallv; but the beast, seeing his enemy so near, ,
,dieeled completely round, put his huge shaggy
eadcloso to the ground before bis fore feet, as is'
k..ir r.u<!nm when thev attack each other, and ra> j
idly advanced upon the hunter, who instantly fired, j
trJ put hi*hall through the hull's mxe; hut seeing
lie temper he was in. and knowing what a serious
utagonist he was when on the offensive, ho, also, j
mniodiutely turned and find.
Ifi running down a short hill some briars threw
lim down, and lie droppel his g in. There was a
rce not far from liirn of about eighteen inches dimeter,
and every thing seemed to depend upon his
caching it; hut. as lie, rose to make a push for it, (
he'buflltlo struck him 0:1 the fleshy part of t)ie hip >
vith his horn, and slightly wounded him. Before, j
lowever, the .beast could wheel round upon him j
igain, lie gained. the tree, upon which all the I
diunce lie had of preserving his life rested. -A ve- j
y )*? w leet from the tree grow a sapling about four
ir live inches in diameter, a most fortunate cirenin- ;
itaiicc ibrllie hunter. u? ;t contributed materially to
iave his life. '!'!" bufliilo ?v w doggedly followed

arms, flung Ifm-ejf round it wi'li greater rapidity
1I1 m the animal could follow him. In this manner
tin* bufliilo liarrassed him more than four hours. until
his hands became so sore with rubbing against
the rough bark <>f the oak tree, anil his limbs so fti- 1
ligiied, tliat he liegurt to be disheartened.
In going round the tree the bufliilo would sometimes
pass between it and the sapling; but the distance
between them was so narrow, that it inconvenienced
him, especially when he wanted to make his
jumps; he, th-refore, frei|iiei)tlv went round the
sapling instead of going in-ide of it. The time
thus consumed was precious to iVrcival?it enabled
liim to breathe, and to consider how lie should defend

carry on this singular defence, t?t at one time he
entertained the idea of leaving tljtree and permit,
ting the animal to destroy him, i a mode of saving
himself from pain and anxiety thjwere intolerable.
But the buffalo, just at that tie giving decided
symptoms of being as tired liimsj, now stopped fol
a few minutes, and Pcrcival t?t coui'age. Remcmbcring
that he had lift; bujer's knitij in his
l>reast he took it out, and beganb contrive plans
of offence; and when the. bull, lnfe rested a while,
recommenced his old rounds, Poyal took advantage
of the slowness of his mobs, and, using a
great deal of address and managent, contrived, in
the course of half an hour, to stahnd art him in a'
dozen different [daces. The ami now bec.amcweak
from the loss of blood, and,hough he con-,
tinued to walk round the tree, in no more jumps,
contenting himself with keeping head and heck j
close to it. This closed the conl for it enabled I
Pcrcival to extend his right armU give him two*!

He bellowed, he groaned, he led the ground,
and gave out every sign ofconscitrniii and unmitigated
lury* He leaned against t,'sapling for support,
and twice knocked himselfrwn by rushing
with his head against the large fe. The second
full terminated this strange trag combat, which
had now lasted nearly six hours. The bulliilo had j
not strength to rise, and the conrror, stepping up :
to him, and lifting up his nigh slider, cut all the
flesh and ligaments loose, and lied it over his
back. He then, after resting hinit a few.minutes
skinned the beast, took a pari of Uinent to his cannot*,
made a fire, broiled and ate if[Fcacrslonhaugh.

tending that important ih i . c,rt'Uf?stances at- 11
are concerned, the project of annexation took it's r<
origin, as we have frequently-*!. ?? i, a T
lioneering iutrjgucs of Mr. Tylers party, rather ' ^
than in any serious apprehensions of foreign- influ- ^
once, or any profound system of national policy.? '
In this resiwct the failnre was complete; and in spite
of- the tricks of Mr. Tyler," and the dying denuncia- a
tion of General Jackson, there is little doubt that n.
the candidate of the parly most hostile to annegation
will succeed to the Presidency at the'ensuing
election. But the effects to which-we allude p
are those produced by the. treaty, even in its incorn- 1
pleto state, on the relations of Texas itself to Jlei- j1
ico, and to other countries. The negotiation nJ
that treaty proved to Mexico and to the world, that ?
in asserting her independence, Texas did not really
aspire to the condition of a tree state, but merely to
a dishonest transfer of her allegiance. All the 1
rights of Mexico, and all the reasons might advance '
ill opposition to the independence of Texas,, were
strengthened a hundred-fold as against such for- (
cign interference with her late sovereignty over the
province; and whatever the late of the treaty might .
be, the hare avowal of such a design by the .Governments
of the Unjted States and of Texas, was
. quito sufficient to determine".'.he Mexican Government
to trust to nothing but the three of arms, either J
?:?. ,t... .iirm-itim or a<raiust its- more |
agiuusi IUU icwitw j._0
powerful neighbor. T .
Several causes concur to render the position of
Texas very critical on ll?c renewal of such a contest.
The rejection of the treaty of annexation is*a severe
blow to the designs of the American party in the
Republic: the presence of ft slave population within
its boundaries, whose future fate dc|K>nds altogethcr
on the political condition of the State, is an
element of -danger in the heart of every village and
CVMjy dwelling, for the sine qua ndn of Mexico is
the abolition of slavery, and the main object of the
American party is its continuance; -Texas is ill-furnished
with the means of carrying on the war; and
5 "President Houston, who appears never to have been
dependence of hircouTitry"anrlthe re^estaf)!islir&Trtf
of peace depend on the vigor with which he may
carry out the principles first proclaimed by its fbmiders.
The alternative,'""which is pointed to with a
sort of horror by the agents of the United States,
as the probable consequence of the rejection of the
project for annexation, is the*conciusion of a freetrade
treaty with Great Britain". That is the monstrum
infandum ingens, against which all these at-'
tacks are directod; that is deemed a sufficient rea
son for a country instantly to forfeit all claims to independence
and self-government: anj Texas is on,
ly worthy a place among the States of the North
American Continent as long as she upholds the in.
stilutions which hless that part of'the globe?slavei
ry and prohibitive duties. We certainly' dissenti
from this opinion so entirely, that we were disposed
to hail with some satisfaction the creation .of a new
t i Southern community, in which commerce might Ire
i carried on without restriction, and slavery might at
j no distant period cease. But these views and these
3 , hopes were in no way peculiar.to Great Britain:
t they are shared in to the fu.lle.-st extent by France,
r Holland, Belgium, and all the European countries
3 , by which Texas has been recognized. If Texas
r | wisely and resolutely proclaims the policy of free
i j trade, she opens her ports equally to all nations; she
jf | secures to her productions a natural preference in.
| all markets; she buys, from all markets on' equal
; terms; and, above all, she gives to all foreign couul
I tries an equal interest in maintaining hot indepeni
, donee. These are principles which are easily ?pt
plied, and which tnust infallibly succeed; they can
give umbrage to none but her enemies or woukhberulcrs;
and they remove every pretext lor those deil
i signs of an exclusive influence, whether commerr
' cial or political, which have been falsely and ab
stirdly imputed to this country. \\'e have rccogniz-1

Upon oilr arrival and introduction to thc Gcner- . 1,
we found him engaged in reading his letters and.
ewapapers, and I am happy to say, iav less infirm - :
tan we had expected, from the'statements We had
eardof his physical debility. He receivedU3 with :
;reat cordiality and kindness, and began to talk at: - ' ?
nee about men and things in our respective sections
if country. From this lie passed to a Variety ot other
opics, moral and political, which he 'discussed with
l clearness and vigor of thought, and a propriety and .
orcc of language that I nevor heard before .in a pri
rate conversation, lie spoKe 100 wiui.uaimimaa ?i
nafiy distinguished public men, whose peculiar traits . .-v
jf character, as ever, one conceded, lie drew in the
rerv light and language of truth. . We .remained .
with him nearly two hours, ancf" during the whole- ..." .
lime he astonished and delighted mc with displays of .** . '>
his enlightened and powerful mind. V "
During the whole of the "General's conversation,
he exhibited no "vanity, no egotism: ncrdid he mako."
any recurrence, that 1 remember, to his own acts. - . .
Upon my remarking to one of the compiny who has .* \
long known the General, that unlike most men, he
had yet no second childhood-*?no, replie4the gentleman,
and lie never will; all the faculties of ht3 mind -now
appear to he just as"clear and strong and manly,- "
as they were in flicir prime.'
. The General'* mansion is a very large .and spacious
one, and presents .agrand appearance as
you appj-oach. It iVbuilt of brjck and is erected on .
the very site Of his old dwelling, that was burrted down
during his Presidency. The present mansion coilsistS
of a main building with a v/ing.on. each side.
The main building is two stories high, with a piazza . .- .
to each story, both in front and rear, which" are sustained
by immense columns, quite as large as the
columns in front of the Presbyterian Church-in "Del- .
roit. The interiorof the house I _shallnot attempt
mitage,and"one emTnmitly^^aracleristicTTi'ts d'isT'" ."^ " ""
tingnishod occupant, is the monument erected by
General Jackson, in his garden, to the memory o *
his deceased wife. The whole, from top to bas5, isf
built of-marble. First, there is a vault, of-circular'
form, 12 or 15 lect in djameterj the top of which is
4 feet from the ground, and is ascended by a -flightof
marble steps. -In the centre stands a pedestal of \ '
square liewu iharjMjl, 0or 8 feet-high, and the whole
is surmounted and sheltered with a marble' roof.
which is supported by columns oWluted marble, 10.
nr 12 feet high. lathe vault, oil one side of the
pedestal, are the remains of his wife, cOi'cred with a '
marble slab; on which is engraved a sublime description
of her worth'and virtues. On the other side
of the pedestal is a place prepared fqr his own remains,
.which is covered with a marble slab, on" '
which, thank -God, there is yet no inscription, .and - long,
very lung by the blessing ot'lkaven, may it be
without one. ?.
The spacious and lofty walls of the General's
mansion, are almost covered splendid paintings, the
most cherished of which, as would naturally be sup-,
nosed, are those of a military character,'-representing
scenes in which bravery has carried its way to sue-,
cess and glory. The General's TaVorite" "picture, I
am told, is one occupying h conspicuous position-in
this hall, which exhibits .Mr. Poirisett', our Minister
to Mexico, bearing and triumphantly displaying from
the balcony of his diplomatic residence the A meriean
flag, as a protection to those who rushed under
its folds to escape from the fury of a murderous Mexican
mo'?! I suppose the value of the picture, in GenJaekson'scMimation
consists in the high respect thus
paid by semi-barbarians, in a foreign land, to tbo
Star Spangled Banner, it has been the great purpose
of his life to uphold and make honorable throughout
the world. . * .*
