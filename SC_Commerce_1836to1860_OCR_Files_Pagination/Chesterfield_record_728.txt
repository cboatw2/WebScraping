F#r I be correction of some of the harsh
features of our Criminal Code, I must
again refer you to the views expressed in
my last annual Message. For the trial
of slaves for capital offences, I respectfully
but urgently, re-iterate my invocation, to
substitute some mode less summary, less
partial, less calculated to pervert the spirit
of our benign laws, to tho injury of
property and the sacrifice of life, than
the present imperfect and ignorantly administered
forms of justice, as applied to

The existing punishment of petit Inrce- {
ny has been found in practice, one of the j
racist Kelu'ary, hut one ofthe mo9t odious, (
of oi! ihe inflictions of the law. But the j
very efficacy it derives from its degrading j
influence on the character of the criminal, j
unfortunately produces, in some install,
ees, a revolting effect upon the sympa- j
thics.oi tho community, that may lead to
remonstrance and opposition. Nolhwith- j
standing it is the most dreaded nnd nbhorrent
of nil legal inflictions, and (hat
the criminal invariably und earnestly pe- :
htions for its commutation to any other ! I
penalty, yet the irresistablc temptations j i
(and sometimes the wants aud necessities) j
growing out of-the embarrassments, and ; <
the immorality ofthe times, have greatly j <
multiplied and aggravated. the crime and j 1
the offenders- Under theso circtimsfan. i <
ces. it would seem to be impolitic, at pre- , |
sent to ameliorate its penalties. The dc-1
gradation which it infiicts upon the char. 1 <
actor of the culprit, cannot in tact, be sup- f
posed to exceed the infamy and disgrace , i
of an oper> conviction, a blighted charac- : i
tor, and ife based mind. The sensibilities j i
ofaoOr>\ict, haidencd to the moral irn- , t
prcssidns of a sentence of guilt pronoun- j r
ced by his peers; the perpetrator of a c
moan and debasing offence like that of (
petit larceny ; is above or below the reach c
of .,11 id* ordinary appliances of the law t
to rcclAfin? or t+ie severity of its penalties , |
lo punish, except through the pangs of the | t
most painful and degrading of all human j !
lr?S;ctitms. js
The punish men t'bf death, it is believed, \
inr.y Ik* judiciously ameliorated in many ?
rases hy'otfjer efficient penalties. But I c
would stilxmil for* your consideration, the f
i\xf>editmey"of subsliluting private for pub- c
hr excufions*'whenever the demands of a j j
great state necessity, render ihe exaction i \
of Jiit* bfotftiv"sacrifice unavoidable. The < t
ilea of condign punishment is always
more terrible and impressive, when left to
the imagination to depict it/and especial-,
ly in the* absence* of those "circumstances
L>f excitement, which are so well calculated
to sustain the nerves nnd-fortitude of
fin impenitent and incontrito culprit. Xo j
young olFonder was ever reclaimed by j
witnessing the heroism of a dying victim
DTlfie law; and wnne MS syinpamscs arc .
but too apt to be enlisted for the suffer
ings which he witnesses, his imagination
is not less likely to bo excited by tho im-posing
importance of a scene, in which the
sense of crime is lost in admiration of the
fortitude, or in commiseration of the agonies
of the offender.
Our legislation should also he directed
to discourage the rash nnd criminal indiscretrons
of youth ; among the most.frequent
and most fatal of which, is that
which ans"s out of tho to|erat?ca (if not
the protection) which our jurisprudence, or
tho mode of administering it, has hitherto |
extended to tlic practice of duelling.?
Founded in the most deeply rooted prejudi^tis,
as well ns upon the noblest and
most honorable incentives of the human
mind, the judicious correction of its evils
and abuses is an object of as much import
tancc to the pence and harmony ofsociety,
as the manner of effecting it must he acknowledged
to be both difficult and delitale.
If it be legarded a9 a necessary
evil,' which cannot he removed without
eradicating some of the highest incentives
n o
to virtue, and substituting baser means of
gratification to tho malignant passions of
society, is it not still expedient to limit it'
within The strict hounds of that necessity,"
by rendering the penalties of the iaw
scarcely less odious or endurable, fhan j
the motive to violate it. That it is some. J
times the only, or most available evidence i
of a high sense of character; or that it !
maj possibly be needful to risk life to J
preserve honor, furnishes no reason, why I
its worse consequences should so frc-1
quently and unnecessarily, be permitted j
to slain the inconsiderate indiscretions of
youth, and the trivial occasions of ordinary
life, with the blood of human victims.
And let it he instructively remembered
that it has become in practice, as much,
and as often the cloak of dishonor, and
the refugo of cowardice, as the protection
and rc.ort of oppressed and persecuted
merit. !n its westward progress, the last
gleaming* of its chivalric origin maveven \

now be discerned to mingle in the disgraceful
brawls of the murderer, the assassin
and the felon. The dilficulty of
effectually repressing the practice in this
State, is perhaps insuperable; but the
omissions in our legislation, or the toleration
of our laws, should no longer be justly
charged with a tendency to encourage
that morbid state of public opinion, requiring
such bloodv and unreasonable sacrifices
to gratify an unappeasable appetite
for excitcjncnt and revenge. Some
salutary check might at least be imposed
by the example of our public functionaries,
to the too frequent and reckless abuso of /
this practice. It would perhaps be safely
advancing one step toward the reformation
of public opinion, if every public
functionary in the State, were restrained
from participating in it by the condition
of his office, it is but just, that while enjoying
the confidence and liberality of the
State, they should be required to comply
with the obligations imposed by their cle-1
vated positions; to present high examples
of conduct, of principle, and of morality ;
an ermine unstained by crime, and hands

Among other causes of moral improvement,
\vc cannot hut contemplate with
great satisfaction, the rapid and extensive i
progress of the Temperance Reform, in
operating upon the habits, the health, and
the happiness of our people. No moral
reformation can be conceived to be more
important or beneficial in its influence on
society, or promises a greater harvest of
those peaceful virtues and moral blessings,
by which the harmony and the prosperity
of a community are so effectually and benignly
promoted. From its influences
on the habits, wc may justly anticipate
the happiest effects on the passions and
the vices of man ; and by abstracting the
s rongest incentives to crime, it may reasonably
he supposed to strengthen the moral
sanctions ol the law, and perhaps in
time, to supersede the necessity of many
of its penal restrictions, it lias evoked a
salutary spirit of change from the licen- I
tiousncss and the phrenzy of inflamed ;
passions, and maddening excitements, to '
that state of dispassionate reason, and '
considerate reflection, so eminently con- j
dueive to the enjoyment of a virtuous and \
peaceful life. And were it proper to look !
beyond these general considerations, for 1
motive to legislation, in the oidinary de- |
tails of private life, they might be amply j ,

Hut while indulging in the gratifying ,
contemplation of its eminent successes |
ind influences, hitherto attained without ,
egi.slative inducements or restrictions, it j,
s well to reflect, whether any legal pro. I
visions, however judicious and well.in- j j
ended on your part, might not impede, 1,
ather than facilitate that progress which |,
)thcr and moral causes, have so much ,
tontribuu'd to advance. Legal interior- i j
:nce, to enforce the obligations of tnorali- I,
y, is but too apt to he regarded by the |
>oop!e with jealousy and distrust, and of- ,
en begets a disposition to evade and vio- ( ,
ate those salutary restraints, which a j
ienseof their own interests might other- ,
vise induce them voluntarily to assume, ! |
md sacredly to respect. The authority ,
;f the law, would bens inadequate to en- t
orce moral habits, as it lias been found by j
un:iv:iilinir to inculcate reli- f
jimia tenets. They must be left to the! |
oiuntarv impulse of the (;o'?r!. and the f
noving msi'irir'iort of their divine origin. J (
Human institutions borrow strength and f i
lustre from tho sanctions of a pure and ' (
high morality, but they cannot recipro- j I
cato the support which they receive. Our j I
enactments may punish crimes, but can I <
not correct vices; they 'irfay reform the !
conduct, but cannot reach the heart, the <
motives, or tho habits of men ; for they <
cfltr neither impart greater terrors, or add ! <
stronger inducements, to the retributions i I
or rewards of an alarmed or an enlight- .<
ened conscience. Let us leave it, then, I
in the hands in which it has so prospered <
?to the influences of an enlightened pub- <
lie opinion?to the dictates of a sound phi- i
losophy?to the suggestions of reason, 1
and tho restraints of morality?to the I

The position of alliance which this l
Stale lias assumed, in defending the insti- i
tutionsof the South, against the nggrcs- '
... c
sivc legislation of New York, is of a char- i
acter too important and interesting, to be I
overlooked, in the deliberations of the pre- ;
sent .session. The wise and necessary I
inspection law?instituted by Virginia. <
to regulate her commercial relations with 1
that Siate, nnd adopted with great pro- 1
priety, and I trust, salutary effect, in this |
-r-has been executed, so far as it has been 1
in my power to enforce it, with the most f j
exact and rigid adherence to its provisions :
and requirements. This measure, mild, j
temperate, and defensive as it is?the i
least that an injured State, oran aggrieved 1
people, could resort to, to protect the rights 1
and property of the citizen?forbearing 1
and constitutional as it must he admitted I
by all States and nations to be?has, I |
regret to say, not yet been responded to, I
by the repeal of tlioso obnoxious measures . 1
against the institutions of the South, upon j 1
the evidence of which, I should have been 11
authcT.zed to suspend its operation.
Yet it has not, I trust, been altogether |
without its effect upon the counsels, or its i
moral influence upon the justice and the
magnanimity, of the enlightened people
of New York. The principles of democracy,
about to he ascendant in her coun- J
sels, wilt unquestionably repudiate the in- (
justice of enacting aggressive laws to vio- ;
la to the rights and institutions of a s sfer i
State. The late decisions of tlic Federal
Judiciary too plainly prohibit and dis- !
countenance such daring and wanton out- '
p . i
rages upon the guarantied and sovereign
rights of an independent member of the
Confedcmy. The confidence of her i
people has already been shriven of the influence
of the actors and instigators of 1
that unwise and illiberal pioceeding; an 1
tho official aggressorsthemselvc s,rebuked,
dishonored, and distrusted, arc about to
be consigned to a merited and retributive
obscurity.
No other legislative action is perhaps
necessary at this time, but to re-enact the
provision of the law, leaving it discretionary
with the Executive to suspend its operation,
in the event of those favorable c >nt
ng' ncie; arising, which would r n> cr it
expedient to exercise i .
Many gratifying, although unofficial,
assurances, induco us to hope for a speedy
renewal of our amicable relations with a j
State whose importance, as one of j
the largest and mosl commercial members 1
of the Confederacy, as well as the j
sound democratic principles and enter- j
prising spirit of her people, and above all,
the friendly associations hitherto subsisting
between us, render in every respect 1
desirable.
The recent and accumulating results
of the geological researches instituted by (
the enlightened cnterprize of almost eve- ,
ry state and people, induce mc again to i
appeal to your patriotic consideration to 1
encourage and promote its useful investi- 1
rations in our own. The resources of 1
. |
our climate, the unexplored treasures of (
our soil, the peculiar value and character .
of our staples, all conspire to impel us on <
ward in a laudable emulation of the sue- j i
cess of other examples to improve those ('
great and permanent means of national i :
wealth and prosperity. In other countries j1
agricultural pursuits constitute but a por- i (
tton of their productive resources?often <
secondary to commerce, to manufactuies, i
and the prosecution of the useful arts, in | (
furnishing the means of wealth or subsis. j 1
tenco. hut with us, it is the great, the j'
universal, and almost the only enduring i,
element, of individual or national prospcri- I <
ty. Even our domestic institutions are j
of a character so immutably agricultural, '
i
ns to^vibralo with all its reverses and vi- |1
cissitudes. They would perish, or depart, !(
f r A L _
in proportion as the pronis 01 uns gre.n i.
branch of industry were neglected, to ! :
seek more hospitable climes, more profit- (
able investments, or a more enterprising <
people. To these impelling motives of M
necessity, toencoiragc the improvements , 1
of this great source of wealth and of re- 11
yenue, we may add tiie attractive induce- ,;i
rnenls which an enlightened sense of our )j
interests present, to institute scientific re- t
searches into those hidden taeasures and ?
undeveloped energies of the soil, which a (
very partial experience has discovered it '
most amply to produce. The aphorism of 1
a great Philosopher, ** that he who causes '
two blades of grass to grow, where only t
one grew before,confers the greatest bene- i.
fit on society,"'may not be literally nppli. s
cable to the improvement of our agricul- <
tural condition ; because our staples, and '
our products, not only substitute, but far ^
exceed the value and the profits of those
primitive objects of husbandry. But be
who stimulates and enlightens the labors [
oy which the millions of other countries as
yell as of our own are employed, clothed, r
tnd subsisted; he who, by adding to the 1
>rolitsof our agricultural industry, arrests [
he rolling tide of emigration; he who,

he homestead, strengthens and fosters i
hoselocal attachments,which aic tlic Iru-, *

2nco of electioneering expedients vvili be
proportionality lessened, as it is diffused
aver a greater surface, and through a
O ' O
greater number, we may justly hope, that
the measure will add to the federative
strength and importance of the States, by
securing greater harmony and unanimity
in the views and counsels of their several
delegations. If it in any manner purities
the deliberations of Congress of its
boisterous elements?if it can allay or appease
the angry spirit, the clamors, confusions
and excitements?if it can expel
those personal contests, which so emphatically
indicate a degenerate In use from the
? 4
sage counsols and grave consultations of
former days?it will have done enough to
propitiate the approbation and consent of
every patriot and moralist.
That Congress should have interfered with
the prescribed modes of election, as they exist
in some States, is perhaps to he regretted,
as unnecessary and inexpedient. But, conforming
as it does, to our principles and practice,
t.'iere can be no objection consistently
ariaing out of the inconvenience of its apphca
Lion to this State.
The legal proceedings which hive been instituted
by the direction of the Legislature,
against a portion of the Banking Institutions
at the Sute, refusing to accept the provision
of 44 An act to prevent tiie suspension of specie
payments," being still [ending the decision of
the'*Judiciary, it would perhaps be improper
and unnecessary to anticipate a resort to the
more effective expedients and appliances of
legislation, to correct evils which the ordinary
jurisprudence of the State may prove adequate
to remedy.
In the meantime, the judicial reference of
th tt question ought not to be permitted to sup
.-rcede the duty of instituting other regula.
Lions for the improvement and stability of our
State currency. The experience ol the last
few years has proved, the bank investments
are disproportionably large to the requirements
of commerce, and the exigencies of the
community?that their profits and business
have diminished as the swollen tide of speculation
has subsided within the ordma^
ry limits of a judicious economy?that a very
moderate, and scarcely a reasonable interest
has succeeded to the enormous profits that
were formerly so magically realized?and that
the inflated prices ot bank stock have rapidly
declined, to an extent as much below, as they
were formerly above, their original value. In
ilii* sudden dearth and abstraction of the ordi
:iary modes arid stimulants ol business and
prori's. it is not surprising, tint the banks
should have resorted to expedients, bordering'
on usury and extortion, and clearly not contemplated
within the legitimate province of
banking operations. Among these, are the
extensive, and perhaps I may add, aim- st
ixclusice and monopolizing operations which
they ha' e conducted in domestic exchange.
l)f all the deranging and sinister influences
upon credit and currency, ihis when carried
Lo the extent of absorbing the entire business
jf bank capital, is perhaps the most fatal and
vitiating, it presents the temptation to ere
ate, and to perpetuate, that very state of ine.
]ualiiy in the.circulation, from which it derives
ts greatest emoluments. It compels the ber ower
to receive his accommodation from, and
neet his engagements with the banks, in cur ericies
of different and unequal value. It supercedes
a sound circulation, with depreciated
paper; traffics in the distresses and exigences
of the people ; and converts banking caplal
into a system of brokerage and extortion,
?x acting from the necessities, rather than
accommodating the commercial require men's,
pf the community. It subjects enterprize and
credit, to the disastrous influences of sudden
md unnecessary contractions, for selfish and
sinister purposes.

That His a pracnce ivmui imo uu>mnvu
i considerable, although 1 ;rust not to so iinnoral
an extent in the business and operations
)f some of our own institutions, may be infer,
ed from the great disproportion which exists
ictwccn iheir profits and circulation. Nor is
t unreasonable to presume that from this
rausc chiefly, the momentary pressure and
l.fliculties of the present year, (on the ccmnercial
class of our citizens especially.) have
>een unnecessarily aggravated, and have doived
their greatest and most unmitigated
severity.
Under ordinary circumstances, a small caplal
with a liberal circulation, is usually proluctive
of the most profitable results, as wcil
is the eas est and most prosperous condition
if the monetary alFairs of a community. Hut
he practice referred to has reversed this
lateral relation between bank capital and its
ises. Our experience presents the fiscal
tnomaly, of a large capital, with a stinted
tirculation. Upward of twelve millions of
>ank stock, realizing an interest of more tiian
ix per cent, on the whole capital, with a cirmiation
not exceeding a million and a half, i
or the relief and accommodation of ilio people! j
iVora this view, it would necessarily seem, I
hal the profits of the sya'cm arc now chiefly j
lerived from other scurces than tho>e which 1
* i
ejjitiiriately How from the ordinary lustnes&oi
jar,king. j
In these remarks, however, justice perhaps
equires that i should state, that the conform- I
ty of most of our gpinor institutions to a po!iy
so latal to the monetary interests of the I
itale, is believed to be in a great measure
onstrained, by the autocratic influence, as
v. II as the seductive example, of our larger
nonicd corporations. He th:s as it may, the
J.uost Liituc diversion of banking operations
ind pcrlfnps the only foundation of an ar-!
lent and permanent patriotism, will ccrainly
achieve more to advance the welfare
of the State, than all the speculations j
if the politicians have ever accomplished.
Tho increased ratio of representation I
established hy the late net of Congress,
ivil! demand your attention, to organize
lur Congressional Districts, so as to conform
to the diminished number of Representatives
to which this State will he entitled.
That it will present to your
consideration a question <>f some practical
Jiflicultics and enr barrassmcnts, is perhaps
'easonably to be expected. Hut I trust it
ivill be productive of no other feelings,
than those arising out of a generous emuo
o
lation to promote the interest and convenience
of all, and a conciliatory sacrifice
' J
>f sectional prejudices and jealousies, to
the general good. The consolatory hopes
md reflections to he derived from the important
provisions of that act, are sufficient
to reconcile us to much greater inconvc
nicnces and disadvantage!), man any u>
which it can possibly subject us. In diminishing
the number, it must increase
the individual responsibilities of members,
*nd perhaps their wisdom and qualifications,
by extending tin opportunities of a
selection to their constituents. A nd while
wo in.iv reasonablv presume that the influ
I into new channels, tho sudden abstraction.o
: the customary bank accommodations from i
j community hitherto flushed and ovcr.stimula
j ted witli the facilities of a redundant cireula
I tion, would of itself produce, as well as aggra!
vate, inucli of that dislinss, which has beet
I so severely and desolalingiy experienced, it
i our State.
The corrective of these evils, and there
i spon3ibility of applying or neglecting it, rcsti
, with you. How far a prohibition to earl
bank to pay out any but its own notes exciu<
i sivo y, would impose a salutary restraint upor
the practices to which I have alluded, I sub
mit to your wisdotn and experience to deter.
1 mine. It is suggested as the most moderate
L
i and cnuitable of those measures within the
! competency of a sovereign State to institute
| in enforcing salutary regulations to establisl
j a sound and stable currency. Whether i
I should apply to aJ, or exclusively to thos<
[ institutions which have refused to coinplj
i with the provisions of the late act, " to preven
j the suspension of specie payments,'' is a mat
! ter which a proper respect for the patriotic
conform ty of some of these institutions to th:
j authority and requirements of a sovereigr
! State, renders worthy of consideration. I
! there be anything onerous in the provisions o
thai act; if there be anything invidious in it!
requirement?, which exposes them to the
espionage, power, or jealousy of rival institu
i tions ; it would certainly not comport with thi
! wisdom and equity of the Legislature, to eub
ject thern to an inconvenient penalty for i
; patriotic compliance with the will of the
i Stale, and thereby pamper and rewarc
j the contumacy of others?, by increasing
! the advantages of thetr recusancy. If tin
I State Ins lost its power to protect, it shouh
; at least abstain from the tyranny of imposing
' partial, and invidious restrictions, on its citi
zens and institutions. 1 f tlie result of the pre
I sent controversy shall, indeed, prove that she
i cannot enforce her laws, let her retire will
dignity, from the position of asserting but a

| an event, exercise the magnanimity of rcmo;
ving any odiou3 disabilities, which nothing
but a willing and patriotic obedience to her
authority, may have enabled her to impose 01

It is not a little gratifying to our Stale pride
and patriotism, that amidst the universa
distress that lias pervaded every portion of tin
Union?the overwhelming embarrrassmcn'i
that have oppressed the energies and resour
ces of almost every Slate in the Confederacy
as well as our own?our financial condition i
continuously if not progressively adequate, t<
i meet all the deininds of a just and libera
economy?our credit scrupulously prescrvedaud.the
imposition of :lic nccessaiy burdenso
our State government as cheerfully borne by
the patriotism of our people, as in ordinary
times of prosperity and abundance. In til1
midst of calamities so well calculated to sug
gest counsels the most dangerous, and cxpedi
ents the most desperate, it is a subject (j
infinite gratification, that the virtue and gooi
j sense of our propie have looked to no inunora
j sources of relief. Neither the violation c
contracts, the evasion of obligations, or tin
repudiation of debts, have for a moment beei
permitted to delude the hopes of our hones
and virtuous yeomanry ; relying alone, as the,

This view, however, of the difficulties unde
which the requirements of an adequate reve
nue are met, should inculcate a most rigid am
scrupulous regard, on your part, to the object
and character of our expenditures. No warn

ion the Federal Government, for advances
j in idu to remunerate our citizens for expenses
incurred m the Florida War. The cause and
occasion of that expenditure, was not one in
which tiic interest, or the safety of this State,
j was the least involved. The philanthropy ol
our citizens, it is true, was prompt to offer
| sympathy and assistance to relieve the pcrii
lous condition of a people, whom the guaran*
! ?ion ,.fflm nr.iivrnment had failed, either bv
treaty, or by arms to protect. Our gallant and
lirgii spirited youth, at every call for their cer
vices, voluntarily rushed to encounter in the
: cause of humanity, and patriotism, all the
perils and privations of a campaign, so fruitless
j of the ordinary glories of war, and where the
I endurance of toil and suffering, and famine
' and disease, were the only conqucs's and
trophies, their valor could achieve. Submitting

any. of this advance, as I am informed, ha-1
yet been refunded; and I therefore recommend
the immediate appointment of a competent
ajent to ilicet a speedy and iqtiitatik
f adyu^ment of this claim, which, so long as
* the authorities of the State shall omit to urge,
will doubtfces slumber among the dusty aud
- forgotten records of the War Department.
The benefits derived by the State from her
11 banking institution, have never been more
i fully realized, than under the auspices of its
present able, aud vigilant direction. Its con
venience, as the real and practical Treasury
3 of the State, has supplied all the necessary
i checks and facilities of a most perfectly
organized financial bureau. Its advances, to
i meet appropriations, ai d instalments on our
- state debt, when all other resources of the
, treasury have been exhausted, have furnished
? facilities not only to discharge her ordinary
31 engagements with a promptitude unpar?.Jle!d4
,j perhaps in the example of any other St. I#
i' government, but to maintain her credit, under
t embarrassing circumstances, and in perilous
3 times like these, when a shade of duubt is
; sufficient to dispel all the attractions of confit
donee. It has added to our annual resources,
. an amount not less than one-third of our.
; revenue, if not for the ordinary objects of

i accruing interest on Stale obligations; while
f at the same time by the judicious and benevof
lent extension of its accommodations, it has
3 done ail within the power ofso limited a capital,
? to alleviate the pressure of the times, and
- protect the property and interests of the
; agricultural community, from sacrifice and
extortion. In addition to these invaluable
i purposes, it subserves the not less iinpoitant
? one, of exercising a salutary aud efficient
! supervision over the monetary interests of the
I State; preventing (by its influence and
i example, as it has done in a former instance,)
1 a general and needless suspension of specie
j payments ; furnishing a sound currency, nei
gociable anywhere in the Union; and csta.
blishing a standard of circulation, by which the
i credit, the business, the exchange, and the
i commerce, of a large portion of the Southi
Western States, are materially regulated.?
i All this, it has accomplished under circumstan*
- ccs of great difficulty and embarrassment,
f arising Irom the jealousy of r.val institutions,
' the operations of large bank capital, its politi- t
i cal ob'.igatiomi to protect, rather than to plunder
the property of the people, and perhaps to
- it e necessary, but inconvenient connexion with
1 some of those benevolent, but unprofitable
i objects of 6ta:e enterprise and beneficence,
s which must unavoidably encumber and oppress
its ordinary business transactions.
In the midst of all thcso evidences of useful .
^ ncss, its operations, if not conducted with tho6?
] great results and exhorbitnul profits, which a
- tcchlcss disregard of the distresses of the com'
I inunily, and an unscrupulous use of advantages,
'4 and of tho mems of extortion, might have real
^ ized, hr.ve nevertheless been productive of fewer
losses, and more emolument, than would satisfy
. the reasonable anticipation of a patriotic Slato,
whose motives in est Mishit g such an institution
^ wcro not impelled by an eager and inordinate
cupidity to enrich her coffers, hy extorting from
p the necessities of her people. ,
n The profits o- the past year, com pored wi.litho
t diminished n suits of similar institutions, and
y the proceeds of .ill other investments of enpitd,
^ in ?y bo regarded as reasonable and fair. It is not
^ to lie expected, that the monicd institution or it
u patriotic Slate shonld not sympathise with the
rise and depression in the pecuniary condition of
r its people. It is not to be desired by a wise snd
j beneficent government?it is not to bo tolerated

from the pressure and exigencies arising out of
' our existing difficulties with Europe, with what
? justice and propriety now when thoemergencies
1 aic greater, and the einbnrrassernents more over
' whelming, can this primary object be overlooked
' or neglected? If there be any thing, therefore,
} in the policy upon which it has been conducted,
. amenable to censure, it is that of a tendency to
i sacrifice this high and patriotic consideration, to
too mercenary a rrgird for large profits and
inordinate emolument.
