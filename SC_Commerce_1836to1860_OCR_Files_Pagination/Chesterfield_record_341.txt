Cocooneries.?firth" construction ofco- otiv

forty P et in width, one storv high ; or in i ven
that proper ion, I think a better form ' r,"ni
would be woe hundred feet long by thirty-1 arr
v two in width, which would afford the same < wic
room. A plain frame UliJJing is best, it ; ant
should be iveatiter-boarded, and instead of i ves
laths and and plaister, the walls should be ;
tightly boarded also. There should be j
windows every six or eight feet on each J7C0
side, with shutters ; and ventilators along ' S''?i
the sides near the floor, and under each i mi
row of hurdles, and.also in the ceiling, to j hm
admit of a free circulation of nir when ne- j tur
C**ssary ; and so a/ranged with shutters that j
they may be closed at pleasure. The bud- j mc
ding should be raised three nr four fee: j
from the ground, on pillnrs, to insure its ; tha
freedom from dump, and to admit the pus- dv
sa^e of-pure uir from below. This uiso WC
renders it more inaccastible to rats and nice, j l;,r
which are very destructive to silk-worms. ; the
It will be a great advuniage if the building i io
have an upper story or half storv, as it will j frc
protect the cocoonery in the lower story, j to
as it wiil protect the cocoonery in the lower thf
fr<?m the heat of the sun, and will be ! I8*"
very useful as a store room for cocoons, J a (
and many other uses. Where there ore high j ha
trees to shade the roof, they will be faund ol I th<
grail benefit; but they should be trimmul ! W]
s?f their branches as high as the top of the "70
iwildiag, to gunrd against dampness, and to m<
secure a free circulation of air around the j m:
buildiog. Fire places should be provided nic
to each side and end of the cocoonery, for wi
v: the purpose of drying the atmosphere in j ry
-damp weather. Or, what is still better,air I mr
furnaces may be provided in small cellars A
uudcr each end of the cocoonery, for this j Wl'
purpose. j of
The jixlttres for a cocoony are properly i SP'
constructed hurdles or shelves on which to A1
feed the worms. There are, probably, tie 3,1
two cocooneries in existence alike in this
respect. Some have nothing but simple jr0(
board shelves, six to eight feet long, sup. , no
ported upou cleets at each end, and made j he
to draw out and in at pleasure. Others {'i<
have frames of die same dimensions, with ' t0net-work
bottoms, and provided wi.h slid. ! w'
Kg shelves two or throe inches below to ',n'
catch the ordure that fulls from thern. I j wr
lave preferred the latter to simple hoards ; j '*,n
but Mr. VVhitmsrsb, wl o lias for many j
years fed worms extensively, and who at: hn'
iirst used net-work hurdles, prefers the sim-j sh<
pie boards, and now uses thrni altogether. '
Of course there can be but little, if any ad. ! ',e
vantage in the former, or ho would not have , K:v
abandoned then) ; and there must be some dn

Hurdles.?The net. work hurJles mny ' a''
be made most cheaply in the following I bf
?nann<T : The frames are formed like the
outside frames of a window sash, of season., j m<
cd pine or poplar stuff, an inch thick, and j
about two inches wide. Maik off the sides 1
end ends on the upper surface with com- J
passes, three fourths of an inch nparr, and j T'K
place half-inch tacks wi:h heads in the j
marks, driven nearly to the head. Then ! c0
take a ball of doubled and twisted cotton CU1
twine, tie the end to the first tack on one j W
corner, and pass it to the other side, around ! ')0
the heads of two of the tacks next to the op- :
posiie corner, drawing tightly, and return to ' nu
the second tack on the first, passing round ,s?
the head of that and the next, and returning in
to the third and fourth tacks on the other p3
side, and so on till all thetacksarc occupied,' 13
and driving down the tacks so that they will1 ter
confine the twine. Then turn the hurdle 1 be
the other way, and fas'en the end of the twine j ea<
to the first tack in the corner and pass the ^'e
tlouble twine alternately overand under two psr
- of the crost threads to the o:her sido, pas- *ed
sing the loop over two tacks drawing them ,ro
tightly and driving down the tacks ; thus &'n
"* ' '? ^ ? % ! out
continuing till the whole hurdle* is nnisiiea.
The meshes will thus be three-quarters of!^'e
au inch square. I have made them by ! anc
perforating the frames with a brad-awl ; ant
and others make them by sawing the frames 1 'or
across at the proper distances, about a
quarter of an inch deep and passing the j evf
twine .hrough the track made by the saw. 1 UP(
think those made with tacks much the siin- j 1
pies?, and as good aa any other. Messrs. ?'Vl
Jenksand Ruinsbuvg of Frederick make; anc^
them in that way. A couple of men can um
make twenty to thirty in a day. Other# j l*ie
make regular netting, and stretch it over s*ar
the corners of the frames, and confine it to ' mui
them with cords. The sizeofthese hurdles ! tfiei
depends upon the fancy of those who make
them. They are generally four to six feet <,Xc
long, and two to three feet wide, i think :

Cutting the leaves.?Some persons direct

any advantage in it, as the worms wdJ
t them fast enough, as Mr. Whitmarsh

en the results of the contrary practice, r
I that here recommended, in parallel col- (
ns, and I once more assure the reader of j <
correctness of I hose results. It my I
tie some persons to be told that tli<y t

efbre it is as well to inform them that I
/ need t.ot do so ; that they will make a
ellenl silk and a fair profit, too, by feed u
well during the day ; and g ving lliom a ti
feed on leaving them at night. Bir d
r must be informed that, for every two li
its they omit fee ding the worms, one day r
be added to the time of feeding, and t<
tho produce of silk will be diminished o
roportion as the time is lengthened. r
'he moulting (or shedding of the skins) ji
he worms, takes place four times, anil a
rrally from five to seven days apart, de- w
ding on the manner in which they ore hi
\
?, :
'tended. Those fe?J upon the high press,
re system, (above recommended,) will
riouit every four or five day-* ; and those
!<J upon tlie ordinary system will generally
noult ev'-ry seven to nine days. These
eriods of moulting are of no other infer' st
o 'he attendant, than affording convenient
leriols for cleaning the hurdles, which
hould he done as soon as the worms reive.
The times of moulting will bo readily
een, hy the worms ncglpo.ing their food,
concealing dieins'dves under the leaves
,nd appealing to he asleep. At these iines,
10 food should he given them, nor stiould
hey he molested in any way. They g -nTallv
rem iid dormant about thirtv hours.
Cleaning the hurdles?As sm?n as they
ippear to have revived, some large fresh
eaves should he laid on th' rn, an I a* soon
is they a'tacli themselves to the leaves,
hey mav b" removed to clean hurdles, hy
aying hold of die stems of die leaves, as
diove directed. For the two first ages
his is the best plan for cleaning them
dowever, many persons never clean fhpni
it all till the 'hird moulting. I. should,
lowever he observed tha?, where much |ir.
er and fihh have accumulated. the hurdl't
should be ejenred of i' ; for if warm damp
sveath-r occurs, it wdl be likely to cause fermentation,
and disease in the worms.
After the third and fourth moul ings, the
most convenient mode of changingand cle.
wing the hurdles is, to place a net-worlt
hurdle immediately over the worms?sr
near diem, tha' 'h'-y can readilv ascend up.
an it through fJ,e mesh* s, and place freal
leaves on it; the worms will soon get u|>or
the fresh hur 'l" and the lower one may hf
drawn out, and the filth carried off.
Until after the two first moultings, fh<
worms will occupy bu1 a small space ; fhej
will require about .'ouDi" ns muro spacm

Diseases of the. Sift Worms.?The

[)t Although the article in the preceding col?f
umns on the fixtures &<\ for feeding silk worms
if is in some parts good, yet it insists on too ex s
pensive a cocoonery for beginnersand culfu>d
rists on a small scale. Any clean house will
answer for a cocoonery which is cIorp enough
Lv to exclude wind and rain, and which has win.
>r dows enough to admit a free circulation of air.
tn The windows must have either shut'ers or
j glass. With glass, shutters are by no means
indispensable. The direct rays of the sun
, must not be allowed to fall on the worms ; but
Ls curtains of either cheap calico or paper will be
J. sufficient to exclude them. No other venti
a lators than common windows are necessary.
And a* to fire places they may or may not be
,p used. la d<tmp cool weather the worms be11
come languid if not torpid, and eat little or
sf nothing, unless the cocoonery is warmed.?
? But they revive with the return of warmth, and
? their health does not seem to be injured by
t their temporary torpor. The only effect so
*v' far as, in our limited cvperiencc, we have been
J, able to observe is, that the tune of feeding is
? prolonged.
Hurdles are not necessary in a first expe
is riment on a email scale. A few thousand
' worms can be removed with little trouble on
ls the leaves on which they are feeding, ap often
^ as may be necessary to clean their tables. In
*| feeding a large number of worms the use of
r hurdles eaves much labor, if they are properly
constructed. Rut unless the netting (or twine
if that bo used) is so attached to the frames
j that it can be loosened and suffered to lie on
,r the worms, many of them will fail to mount it
. and will be left behind when it is removed.

Those who read the n solutions or the New
Jersey Legislature on the subject of the ex.
elusion irom the House of Representative of
' the persons commissioned by the Governor of
of that State, may remember that one of the
} resolutions required that them to be sent to
; "the Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, a representative
, from Virginia" with a request that he would
t lay them ' before the other representatives
from the several states now assembled at
Washington."
Mr. Hunter upon receiving the resolutions
through the Governor of New Jersey, replied
that lie would not present them to the House
of Representatives, because, while they were
addressed to him as the presiding officer, they
seemed to have been framed with a view to
deny that ho was regularly the Speaker of
the tlouse, or that the House was properly
organized, Mr, Randolph the only sitting
member from New Jersey some days afterwards
enquired of the Speaker, in the House,
if the resolutions had been received by himf
and if so, why he had not presented them to
tiie House. This, after various motions and
considerable debate, led to the Speaker's presenting
to the House the correspondence between
himself and the Governor of ^New Jersey
011 the subject. The resolutions were
subsequent y sent officially to Mr. Randolph
who presented them to the House.
A writer in the Charleston Courier nominates
Chancellor D-ivid Johnson for the office
of Governor of South Carolina. The Courier
declares itself in favor of the nomination, and
says that when it assented to the nomination of
Col. Richardson it supposed there was an understanding
with the friends of Judge Johnson
that lie was not to be run. The Mercury, on
the other hand earnest'y opposes the nomination
of Judge Ji.hnson, on the ground that
he is not a sufficiently zealous supporter of
the {rub-Treasury project "with the specie
clause."
New Publications.?A new work by
Henry W. Ells north Esq, has just been

who have seen it. I. is a 12 mo. Volume ^
of more than 300 pages.

Gen. McD'jifie iMvered ins eulogy on
(he character of Gen. Hayne, in the Circular
Church, Charleston, <?n the 13th. As
was to be expected on such an occasion
the house was greatly crowded. Of the
performance th<- Courier says :
The Orator th< n row and pronounced a
noble and eloquent eulogy on the character,
an I se-vices of the illustrious deceased, emoruc
ng h s biography, even from his birth
i?n I boyish days, and through his brilliant
and unnleruis'iej cureer of manhood, to it*
su '<h n and lamented close, in the faithful
ami zealous discharge of respons ble public
duues and in the highest and pulmiest
state of his lame and usefulness, in an untimely
and stratiger grave. The interest of
h'? discourse was grea |y rnhanced too
by occasional anecdotes illustrative of the
energy, and industry, the fidelity to private
duty, and pa riotic devotion to the public
good, which mailed the character and
illuminated the life of one of the purest
patriots and most us- ful cifiz-ns our City
and State have bmi called on, in life to
honor, and iu death to mourn.
The Courier, in a d ffLrent urticlo com.
plains of Gen. M Duffi" for entering into n
i defence of Noli.fication in his addn 83, and ^
: iiis s's fa' it was a violation of the truce
' bet we' n th<* Nui! fication and Union partea.
When a reconciliation between the
parties took place, it was with no sacrifice of
principle or change of opinion by cither.?
Each was of course at liberty still to defend
its principles on any suituble occasion.?
But this (he Courier contends was not a
suitable occasion. The orator had been
appoin ed by a committee composed of
bon? Null.fi-TSHnd Un on men, and was addr
ssing an assemblage composed of both
parties. The Mercury, on the other hand
contends thai 'here was nothing in the ad*
