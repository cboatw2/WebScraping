FROM TUB CHARLESTON MERCURY. 1
JUDGE CHEVES' LETTER. ]
have been informed, to my surprise, that, in ,
sequence of a short note, addressed to my fel- ,
v-citizons of the neighborhood in which 1 live, ,
i the 4th July last, I ain supposed to be in favor ,
/f resistance by the action of South Carolina t
alone. Such an impression is entirely erroneous. {
1 expressed a dozen years since, the sainc seuti- <
rncnts, almost in the same words, and was, at the
same nine, as is well Known, uecuieuiy opposed j
to resistance by a single State. But I shall now, i
with your permission, leave no doubt of the posi- i
tion in which i wish to stand, and, in doing so, 1 t
shall mingle my opinions and counsels with those
of my fellow-citizens, to be weighed for what I
they are worth, in "this great argument." >,
The farill I consider an act of insufferable and
insulting oppression, which ought to be borne only I
until it can be judiciously resisted. But this re- s
sistance, in my opinion, to bo effective, must unite i
the efforts of, at least, a large portion of the suf- i
ferers. I do not think one State ought to resist
alone. There will he neither confidence nor cer- 1
taintv in such a course. The people of one State, '
standing alone, would not be heartily united |
among themselves. It might be different ll the i
Stair were ulune in the suffering; hut standing in
t ; midst of common sufferers, much more nuuio- |
reus than themselves, whose arms were folded, i
thu presence of these would oueratc like a moral i

In tr . .pinion, it they dn not, tlicv wili li< , .<iuisible
to honor and to shame, an<l equally so, to
their interests and their danger. Hut we dare not
cast this reproach upon them merely because they
do not think fit to adopt our measures and our
time. If we think they are tardy, we must en- <
treat them with brotherly zeal to quicken their <
step. If oim* measures be not acceptable to them, i
let us modify them, or adopt them, if they lead l
to the same end. Resistance will be a very so- ?
lemn act. If it be rashly attempted and fail, it i
will rivet our chains and bring on us new burdens i
and insults. Success in such great enterprises is I
not usually the result of a sudden thought or the |
fruit of a single day, but of wise and sober deli- berations
and protracted action. We are speaking |
of the movement of nations?a successful resist- I
ance will probably cost some years. Thecircum- '
stances in which we are placed cannot fail to re- t
mind us of our first great act of resistance to op- I
presslon. Jjci us men uoast less o(Yo*? and U-m <
idly of the deeds of our ancestors, and more faith- I
fully imitate them. They did not jump in a sin- I
gle breath to their conclusion, and talk of single- I
handed resistance. They deliberated long, and I
they wisely united all who were under common
suffering and in common danger. Let us do as t
they did. Let associations be formed in every 1

>juuuii;rii, aim, n possiuic, >.n every South West- 1
ern State, and let them confer together and inter- I
change views and information ; let leading men, t
through Committees and private correspondence '
collect, compare and concentrate the views of like 1
men in the respective States, and when ripe for it, t
and not belore, let representatives from these '
States meet in Convention, and, if circumstances '
promise success, let them then delil>erate on the '
mode of resistance and the measure of redress.? '
If not, still persevere; let neither delay nor first
failures, should they happen, create despair or 1
faint-hearted "ess T?l!oxiblo perseverance rnr-ly 1
fails in a good cause, and ours is pne that must 1

cn-i'>ijui and desultory, Suit organized and incessant;
avoid especially all blustering, and put in '
the jilace of it sound sense and forcible reason- (
ing. Vour appeals to your fellow citizens may, |
nevertheless, be as impassioned as your sense of
injury and shame and danger may inspire, but 5
they ought to be chastened by a regard to the '
moral sense of an enlightened community. Add ]
to the proper functions of the newspaper press, ]
the circulation of able and well chosen tracts, and

colonies in their preparation tor resistance to the 1
mother country. During that struggle we hail I
among our friends the Burkes and the ('hathams, '
and others of the greatest names that ever adorn- '
ed humanity. There are in every country virtuous
men who hate injustice and detest oppression,
though they ho the acts of their own country and
government; and their influence, though tliey liuiy 1
not be able to carry a vote, lias often great moral '
and political weight. Their approbation will have
great effect in sustaining your own resolution.?
But in this case you may appeal to your interest
as well as their justice, for the mass of the peo- ;
pie, no where, derive any advantage from the op- 1
pression you suffer, and have great and honest interest.
put at hazard by the resistance you may he
obliged to make. Manufucturca should be the 1
last resort of industry, in every country ; for,
when forced, as they are with us, they serve iio 1
interests hut those of the capitalists who set them
in motion, and their immediate localities. Commerce
is the proper hand maid of agriculture, and
agriculture the blessed employment of man. Al- '
ready both arc languishing under the intriguing
power of manufacturing capitalists. Without the
agriculture of the South and South West, the <
grass would grow in the streets of your great
Northern cities. What, comparatively, would
Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Jtaltinioro
be, were the South ami South West, or even the I i
South alone, obliged to retire from tlie Union I?
What. if our intercourse with these cities were
transferred to Liverpool and Havre ! A moments t
reflection will Ire sullicient to show how little difficult
this trader would he, especially when we
consider the present and growing celerity of
steam power. These and like ports are the ultimate
points of our present commerce, though we
are contented (good, easy people as we are when I
not trampled to the earth by oppression) to hear
the charges of a double transit and to employ these
Northern cities as our factors. What, if the tin- i
happy event of separation shall he provoked, is
to prevent us from doing our own business, as
wo have done before, and reaping the profits i
which we now bestow 011 others, and which have
made the Commercial men of the North and Cast 1

Orleans would speedily swell into the present |
magnitude of New York, and overy town and in- <
terest connected with lliein would increase and <
flourish iri proportion. These may he called hy
the interested and unreflecting, idle dreams, but I
those acquainted with the nature of commerce, ,
and who have reflected on the concentrating pow- (
er of the union which now builds up and sustains ]
the great Northern and Eastern cities, well know |
that they aro sohor truths, and that, in the event <
deprecated, the result is certain and inevitable.? <
Rouse, then, tho proper enquiries, and you will i
have numerous friends within the enemies lines, |
and these, too, will be the best friends of their |
own immediate countries. <
Renounce absolutely and unreservedly, during i

Jie union. Fill no office under the General Opvjrnment
except in the Legislative Halls, Tfris

parts of the Union. The west have at present

Western States (by which I mean all South and
West of the Ohio River) arc of our blood and lineage;
their Institutions are more or less Southern,
and their interests arc really the same as those of
the South. There is reason, therefore, to hope
that ere long we shall stand, as we were wont to
do, in our country's more liberal and palmy days,
side by side in our political movements, liy this
natural alliance in former times was the highhanded
power of that same people that now oppress
you, put down. This was the policy of
TeU'orson, and this formed the great Democratic
party of the Union. That great bond is now
fearfully shattered, ami almost severed by tariff

What is the cause of this deplorable condition of

Bvcn in elfect, turned into curses. J?ut, to return
from this too long, but interesting digression, in
which we have looked with a kind of prophetic
vision, we think, on what we hope to see realized
at no distant day. When three or four States
shall arise with unflinching front, and unite heartily
and resolutely, otheis will speedily .join them,
and our relief will, in all likelihood, be peaceably
accomplished, and the Union preserved. Vet let
not this blessed hope be relied upon with confidence,
but anticipate a worse result, and be propared
to meet it.
I>ut shall we put at hazard that Union which
we so much love and honor, in which w e purchased
a partnership with so many sacrifices, and be
forced out of it by that very people against whom
we have heretofore defended it? It is, in my
opinion, a lamentable truth, that that hazard must
be met, and it is idle, and even dangcro to hesitate
in avowing it as the possible residt. however
much we may deprecate it. There arc woiso
evils than disunion, and we can hardly doubt th<iV
we have been long suffering under their. J?ut if
the dissolution of the Union he a great e ii, and it
certainly will he so to the American people, and
would be so to us, if we were permitted to enjoy
its benefits, the guilt and the reproach will rest
upon those who wantonly provoked it, and those
w ho have xvantonlv suffered it to fake nlaco Vea
wantonly, for the historian must record the fact,
that "the sacrifice of that glorious institution, which
might have secured and perpetuated to a distant
posterity, the happiness, prosperity and greatness
of twenty millions of people, at this time and of
more than an hundred to no very remote futurity,
was made to gratify the inordinate avarice of a few
score (not more) of great capitalists in a small section
of the country, and the furious madness of a
smaller number of fanatical abolitionists, who
combined together to oppress the interests
and to destroy the peace and happiness of the
people cf the Southern States, who; to the honor
if humanity resisted ami overthrew their wicked
lesigns.
Hefore CJod, we do not wish disunion. Lot the
TJovernment be justly administered and we will
^lory in the Union, and give it our whole hearts
and strength in peace and war, us we have done
bofore, when some of its most noisy eulogists, at
the present lime, were not in the ranks with us,?
when they were almost in the ranks of a foreign
enemy. J?ut who has heretpfore spoken of disunion
1 whence did the odious term originate]?
not surely from the South. It came in the chill
blast of the North and Last. Jiy what description

power, of which I shall give but one proof. That,
is a letter of the Anachartis Clootes of the United
{>tates. In this letter, after abusing, in the grossest
terms, the President of the United States, the
present Secretary of State and several of his predecessors,
and denouncing generally the conduct
of the Government of his own country, and
showing himself in heart and soul devoted to the
unfriendly views of a foreign country, ho comes
down to the late letter of remonstrance of Mr
Calhoun to the British Minister and says, "we arc
yet to learn with what ears the sound of the trumpet
of slavery was listened to by the British Queer
and her ministers. We are yet to learn, whethci
the successor of Elizabeth 011 the throne of England
und her Burlei gli's and Walsinghnm upon
hearing, that their avowed -purpose to promote universal
emancipation, and the extinction of slavery, it

exterminating war ; will, like rrave/7 cowards, turn
their haeh and flee, or rat their own words, or dis
claim the purpose and object which they hare avow

step further without entering your tei ritories and
controlling your laws ? Whether they do noi
now shake the union, and whether if they can pro
ceed any farther they will not destroy it 1 These
are the allies of the Whigs and the manufacturers

crop; I can only tell what I have seen ami heard
1 I passed through Orange, Richland, Fairfield, Un
' ion, .Spartanburg, Greenville, Laurens, Newberr
and Lexington, the heart of the Cotton country
' 10very where I saw the same appearance, thoug!
in different degrees. The plant was uriusualh
' small?hud attained its full growth near two mouth
' earlier than usual?flfcd suffered at the most ini
portant season of its fruiting from extreme drought
and had consequently scarcely any bolls on the up
! per part of the stalk. The rust too, has prevaile<
1 almost universally, in many places ruinously. Al
most the whole crop 4s matured and open, and
' very large proportion of it picked. There cui
! no longer be any doubt of its extent?no mon
bolls can be made, and it will in some district
scarcely reach lialt'j| crop, in others but little ex
coed it, and on the whole will not reach the croj
1 of lust year by probably a third. This opinion i
( not confined |p the Districts 1 have named above
J>ut from information received from all other part
' of the State, in most of which a like condition c
things exist;' it extends to the crop of the Stat
ns a whole. The grnin crops are also short, tin
drought has fallen with peculiar severity on Oat
and lute Corn; the Pens are an almost total failure
' The intensity of the drought may bcilldgftl C
when I tell you that liefore the rain of ^l^tek
the creeks branches, springs and wells along ,<h
- roads of the upper country had been dried up be
yonnl nny thing known before. The Savannah Itiv
er was reduced so as to be daily forded at Ati
' gusta. The rains of last week raised it fifteen fc?
in one night, but it has futlcn almost as rapidly a
: it rose. The earth was so parched and thirst;
that it absorbed ond retained nil the rain tha

; bonrd the packet boat Onondaga, a man died ii
' a very sudden and awful turner. lie had takei
i the liberty to avow himsd^Ki infidel, and to pou
i the most norrid anathem2^%pon Christianity an<
r its author, and was exceedingly enraged agains
. any that dared to j^jirov* him. While engugei
. in this wickedness, and "whilo in the very act o
. cursing the followers of Christ, he fell upon thi
i deck of the boat and instantly expired. All pre
sent, says the individual who gave us the fact
i in the ease, were admonished of the truth of tha
t declaration, "liod is not mocked,"

TO OUR 1
It is very seldom wo occrpv a-y u? ?/ "* , :
dressing our Patrons, and we r*y
few words to them in earnest, 'k wc hn c
?
from time to time conversed with some as intelligent
as any, yet in order that we should at once, ^
without distinction of persons, deliver our feelings,
views, and intentions, we nsk your attention.
In the first place, we tender our sincere thanks
to our friends for the interest they have taken in
the prosperity nnd success of "The Spartan,'*
particularly those who have lent the aid of their
pens, and all wc have to say to them is, "be not
weary in well doing." There is enough talent
antotigst^individuals of both parties to furnish material
for eccH successive issue. We would respectfully
' emind you that, though the success of
the cnteHijU'. has exceeded our most sanguine 4
expectation, there is yet grcut room for improvement.
We ask our readers if we have not fulfilled
our promise, so far] Have we not even exceeded
the promises made] Where can a more elegant
and tasteful newspaper bo found in the
State,?or even in any State] For this we clainv
but little credit: this properly belongs to tlie Printers,
and therefore we feel ut liberty to speak concerning
it. And though it requires a large amount
to defray the necessary expenses attendant, yet wo
still hope for the best?we still rely upon the rc- '
t sources that Spartanburg possesses both mentally
and.pecuniary, for making h6P own paper pcrma
nent.
We labored under many difficulties at ourcornj
rncncement which were calculated to dishearten
. both Editors and subscribers; all of which wo
! hope, by the beginning of another volume wil b?
surmounted. Wo have had frequent cause to re.
gret that from some cause or other, our paper did
. not reach regularly some of our subscriliers. Wo
i flatter ourselves that now there is no cause to prc"
vent, unless through the inadvertence and ovcr'
sight of those whose duties it is to deliver them.
. *
, Our thanks are due the various Post-mnsters who
. have acted as our agents in procuring subscribers,
and we respectfully solicit continuance of their ;
j aid. In short, kind patrons, we request one and
^ all of you, still to hold us under reciprocal obligation;
and though we feel certain that we render
> you an equivalent for your patronage, yet we have
. deemed it expedient thus to address you.
! Judor Cuktrs* Letter.'?We lay before our
readers in this week's paper a part of tliis able
p document. It is fraught with 'much that will inI
terest ou'i readers. Though we are neutral in polM
?"fy. ? ' affirm that it gives
* e\TJe<*6e of a'pow erfu! mind; and considering the
stylo, which froin the nature of the subject upon
, whirl, hr treats, is vcry'senter.tious, we must pro
nounce it ofte of the very ablest documents exf
tant.
Our Correspondent in this week's paper touches
upon some interesting and singular subjects; a'
nrongst which is his conBrmation of the report
j- (which was looked upon some time since us a
hoax,) that the Siamese Twins had taken each a
t "better half." This, to say the least, is very rc1
markable: and though our correspondent, on good
authority, asserts that the ladies are "amiable and
industrious," we opine their tastes must have been
. somewhat vitiated, and tin; humps of xrlj-esteem
s rather small in comparison with others in a more
1 occipital region of the head.

q Gen. Jackson has written another letter upon
s the subject of Texas, which wo cannot lay before

' Spectator says:
