bourhood of Rees’s meeting-house, (a place where
we greatly needed a revival;) and determined to
■ make an extra effort there. ■ We accordingly ap
pointed a two days’ meeting to commence the 11th
of November. On the second day, an invitation
for mourners to present themselves for prayers was
given, and quite a number came forward, and many
of them those who had been apparently the most
careless. The indications were so favourable, that
it was thought best to protract the meeting, which
was accordingly done. Being compelled to attend
my appointments in another part of the circuit, I
left the work to be conducted by our worthy
brother, John J. Triggs;, and he (being assisted by
other local brethren and the leaders,) continued it,
■ the interest and power increasing, until the follow
ing Sabbath, more or less coming in every day: and
at the close, it was found that there had been added
to the church On trial, fifty-one whites and twenty
two coloured. On yesterday, we added four more,
two whites and two coloured. At Olive Branch
we have admitted niue, making in all since camp
meeting, eighty-six, which, with the twenty-eight
who joined at that time, makes one hundred and
fourteen as the fruit of the camp-meeting directly
or indirectly, although it was regarded as rather an
unfruitful meeting. A number of those who have
joined, are young men of some promise. This re
vival has greatly refreshed and encouraged the
church, and we hope its influence will be long felt.
0, that this good work may go on, and that these
lambs of the flock may never be scattered or torn
by the wolf of hell. Yours, truly,

■' THE MISSIONARY CAUSE.
'To the Editor of the Southern Christian Advocate:— .
Dear Sir,—I hereby enclose twelve dollars for
Missionary purposes, to which you will give »
proper direction. Although I am not a member of
any church, yet I am glad#o hear of the spread of
the gospel. I adopted a plan some years ago to
give about one bushel of commit of every hundred
raised in my crop, to the support of the missionary
cause. Some years I make a good crop, and corn
sells low ; and then again a small crop, and the ar
ticle sells higher. So the amount raised by the
sale of every hundredth bushel varies generally
from five to seven dollars per annum. The amount
enclosed is for two years. I have not paid it over
before, because there is no circuit preaching in my
neighbourhood. I suppose I live in the bounds of
the Fort Gaines circuit, Georgia: but it is about
fifteen miles to the nearest meeting house. Our
settlement is populous enough, but composed chief
ly of persons belonging to the several orders of
the Baptist persuasion.
Wishing the cause of missions much success
and increasing prosperity, I subscribe myself,
, Yours, respectfully,
Stephen Blockek.

Fifteen Days Later from Europe.
We are indebted to Wilroer and Smith’s Times
for the following summary.
The Duke and Duchess de Nemours landed at
Woolwich on the 17th November, under a royal
salute from the field battery. The crew of the
Archimede gave three cheers when the Duke and
Duchess de Nemours left the vessel; and the
workmen of the dockyard gave three cheers on their
leaving for Windsor Castle.
Arrived at Windsor, her majesty Queen Victo
ria received her royal and illustrious guests in the
most warm and friendly manner, affectionately kiss
ing her royal highness, and proceeding with her
hand-in-hand to the grand drawing room, accom
panied by the Duke de Nemours and the prince
consort, and followed by the royal attendants.—
The Duchess de Nemours, who is first cousin of
his royal highness Prince Albert, being the daugh
ter of the Duke Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg Gotha,
the brother of the reigning duke, was married to
the Duke de Nemours, the eldest surviving son of
the King of the French, in 1840.
The Anti-Corn Law League are again going
ahead. The speech of Mr. Cobden, which he de
livered at Manchester on last Tuesday week, may
be taken as an earnest of the feeling which ani
mates the directors of the movement. In that me
tropolis of the manufactures of the empire, the
enormous sum of £12,000 was collected in one
day towards the league’s new fund of £100,000.
Most of the contributors to the fund have doubled
their subscriptions on those of last year. This is
the first commencement ot the new movement.
The free traders, it must be confessed, bleed freely.
Meetings will shortly be held in the other leading
towns of England and Scotland.
The state trials, in Ireland, drag their slow length
along. No progress has yet been made, and, if the
statement which has been put forth by the Times’
correspondent be correct, that the defendants have
30,000 witnesses to examine, the proceedings will
become the greatest bore in the world (not except
ing even the Thames Tunnel) before they are fin
ished.
The Great Britain, the mammoth steamer, built
and launched at Bristol this summer, is expected
at Liverpool before Christmas, and will astonish the
good citizens of New ' York some fine day in the
ensuing spring, by challenging their criticism, and,
it may be, their admiration.
The Hibernia, Laptain Judkins, still maintains
her supremacy as queen of the waters—as the fast
est Atlantic steamer afloat. She arrived out on
Tuesday morning, at five o’clock, after a passage
of twelve and a half days from Boston.
The ship Nimrod of Sydney, New South Wales
is reported as having on board, when last heard
from, a three gallon cask of gold dust and bars,
which had been obtained by trading with the na
tives of the Island of Borneo. A sample sent to
the owners proved to be of very rich quality.
The accounts from the East tell a lamentable tale
of blood, assassination, and treason. The native
Governments are gradually crumbling to pieces
from sheer inanition. The Punjaub has witnessed
the hands of its ministers and sovereign incarna
dined, under circumstances marked by peculiar
treachery and atrocity.
By a recent return it appears that during the last
year out of upwards of a million persons who travel
ed by railway in different parts of England, only one
met with a fatal accident from causes not attributa
ble to individual carelessness or rashness. Thus
it follows that railway passengers may calculate that
the chances are a million to one in favour of their
safety.
All parties in America, connected with the trade
of Liverpool, will not hear with less surprise than
did the good people of that port themselveB, that a
project has been set on foot for the erection of
clocks on the Cheshire side of the Mersey. The
project is a bold—nay more, it is a magnificent one.
Luton Hoo, or High Luton, a magnificent seat
belonging to the Marquis of Bute, about two miles
to the east of the town of Luton, has been almost
entirely reduced to a mass of smoking ruins.
On Sunday week Miss E. Newton preached in
the Wesleyan Chapel, Yarm, to a crowded congre
gation.
American cheese continues to arrive by hundreds
of boxes at a time, and American beef is also com
ing iji freely.
France.—The Duchess of Orleans attended the
Lutheran church in Paris, on Sunday last, for the
first time since the death of the Duke. She ap
peared greatly affected.
French Steamers.—The Paris Correspondent of
the Boston Atlas says in one of his late letters,
that the French Minister of Marine has issued an
order to the commandant at L’Orient, urging him to
hasten the armament of the four transatlantic Stea
mers fitting out there. The French are straining
every nerve to have a force of steam vessels of war
superior to that of England; and a special com
mittee, consisting of theMinister of Marine as presi
dent, and twelve members, (among whom is the
Prince do Joinville, now Rear Admiral,) has been
appointed by royal ordinance for the purpose of
making inquiries respecting the building, organiza
tion, and arming of war steamers.
Letters from Pondicherry announce- that the
government of Bourbon has taken possession of
the islands of Amsterdam and St. Paul, and left gar
risons there.
La Presse announces the arrival of Prince Polig
nac with his family at Paris, where he proposes to
pass the winter.
A few days ago while the great bell of the cathe
dral of Notre Dame was being rung, the clapper
gave way, and the enormous mass fell down through
two floors of the tower, and lodged at the third.
Three persons were injured.
Accounts have been received of the death of Dr.
A. Petit, who was sent on a scientific mission to
Abyssinia, by the Museum of Natural History of
Paris. In crossing one of the branches of the Blue
Nile, he was seized by a crocodile, and devoured.
•
Italy.—It is denied that there has been any
movement of Austrian troops on the Boulognese
frontier . a body of soldiers only went, at the request
of the Duke of Modena, to share in some military
parade manoeuvres, and then they returned to quar
ters. The Guerilla warfare against the govern
ment of Rome and Piedmont continues ; and the
efforts to put it down are trifling and inefficient.
Austria awaits an invitation to interpose.
The Due d’Aumale, after visiting the King of
Sardinia, arrived at Civita Vecchia on the 28th Oc
tober, and went to Rome to visit the Pope. -
A letter from Bologna, of the 6th states! that M.
Barrette of Ravenna, had been arrested for the
part be took in the late disturbances. He was for
some time settled at Bologna. A quantity of arms
and ammunition were found in his house. A barber
who was accused of putting up a treasonable pla
card at a Cafe was also arrested.
The disturbances were still far from being put
down. Several of the insurgents had taken refuge
in Malta and Corsica, and it was said that the Italian
states had applied to have them removed.
It is by no means likely that the English Govern
ment will accede to this request, but the French
have already so far complied with it as to remove all
Italians from Corsica to the interior of France.
The two brothers Muratori, the Counts Beucoli and
Righi, the Marquess of Mellara and several other
refugees have been ordered to Chateau Rouge.
Greece.—A letter in the Augsburgh Gazette
dated “ Frontiers of Poland, 25th October,” says,—
“I can now announce to you without the fear of
contradiction, that the Emperor Nicholas has for
mally expressed his displeasure at the Greek revo
lution : and that he has deprived M. Katakazi (Rus
sian minister) of his situation, and that a sympathy
in the new order of things be submitted to a court
of inquiry. It is added that the troops concentrated
at Kiew be directed to march to the Pruth.” The
Moniteur Parisien adds, that a commissioner extra
ordinary has been sent to Athens with a protest
against the revolution. It is also said that the King
of Prussia has recalled his representative.
Egypt.—Letters from Alexandria, of the 16th of
October state that Ahmed, Pacha of Soudan, had
declared himself independent of Mehiemet Ali:
who had given orders to place 40,000-men under
arms, to reduce his contumacious subordinate to
obedience. Ahmed is forty-five years of age, cool,
and “as brave as a lion.” “In his youth,” says
the Times, “ he was purchased with other Circas
sian slaves, by Mehemet Ali. He was brought up
a soldier, and was enrolled in the first regular re
giment ever raised in Egypt. He first served in
Arabia and the Hedjaz ; was promoted to the rank
of C>lonel, and subsequently sent to Candia, and
finally to St? Jean d’Acre, where he particularly
distinguished himself for his brilliant courage.
He followed the fate of the Egyptian army in
Syria; his regiment having been ever distinguish
ed for its bravery and discipline. In the year 1836
he was made Minister of War at Cairo. The Pacha
wished to deduct from the pay of the army all ex
penses of arms and artillery which had been con
sumed in the wars of Syria.
The revolt of Ahmed has caused Mehemet Ali
serious uneasiness, because in attacking Ahmed he
attacks the Porte. Mehemet Ali has sent presents
to Constantinople,—a carriage and four horses for
the mother of the Sultan, six horses for the Sultan
himself and two for his ministers.

EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESIDENT’S
MKSSAfiR.
To the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United Stales.
If any People ever had cause to render up thanks
to the Supreme Being fur parental care and protec
tion extended to them in all the trials and difficulties
to which they have been from time to time exposed,
we certainly are that People. Prom the first settle
ment of our forefathers on this continent,—through
the dangers attendant upon the occupation of a sav
age wilderness,—through a long period of Colonial
dependence,—through the war of the Revolution,—
in the wisdom which led to the adoption of the ex
isting Republican forms of Government,—in the
hazards incident to a war subsequently waged with
one of the most powerful nations of the earth,—in
the inctease of our population,—in the spread of the
arts and sciences and in the strength and durability
conferred on political institutionsemanatingfromthe
People, and sustained by their will,—the superin
tendence ' of an overruling Providence has been
plainly visible.—As preparatory, therefore, to enter
ing once more upon the high duties of legislation, it
becomes us humbly to acknowledge our dependence
upon Him as our guide and protector, and to implore
a continuance of His parental watchfulness over
our beloved country. We have new cause for the
expression of our gratitude in the preservation of the
health of our fellow-citizens, with some partial and
local exceptions, during the past season,—for the
abundance with which tho earth has yielded up its
fruits to the labors of the husbandman,—for the re
newed activity which has been imparted to com-1
merce,—for the revival of trade in all its depart- j
ments,—for the increased rewards attendant on the
exercise of the mechanic arts,—for the continued !
growth of our population and the rapidly reviving
prosperity of the whole country. I shall be permit
ted to exchange congratulations with you, gentlemen
of the two Houses of Congress, on these auspicious
circumstances, and to assure you, in advance, of my
ready disposition to concur with you in the adoption j
of all such measures as shall be calculated to increase
the happiness of our constituents and to advance the
glory of our common country.
Since the last adjournment of Congress, the Exe
cutive has relaxed no effort to render indestructible
the relations of amity which no happily exist be
tween the United States and other countries. The
treaty lately concluded with Great Britain has
tended greatly to increase the good understanding
which a reciprocity of interest is calculated to en
courage, and it is most ardently to be hoped that
nothing may transpire to interrupt the relation of
amity which it ia bo obviously the policy of both
nations to cultivate. . >
A question of much importance still remains to
be adjusted between them. The territorial limits of
the two countries in relation to what is commonly
known as the Oregon territory, still remain in dis
pute. The United States, would be at all times in
disposed to aggrandize themselves at the expense
of any other nation ; but while they would be re
strained by principles of honor, which should govern
the conduct of nations as well as that of individuals,
from setting up a demand for a territory which does
not belong to them, they would as unwillingly con
sent to a surrender of their rights. After the most
rigid, and as far as practicable, unbiased examina
tion of the subject, the United States have always
contended that their rights appertain to the entire
region of country lying on the Pacific, and embraced
within the forty-second and fifty-fourth® 40m, of
North latitude. This claim being controverted by
Great Britain, those who have preceded the present
Executive, actuated, no doubt, by an earnest desire
to adjust the matter upon terms mutually satisfacto
ry to both countries, have caused to be submitted to
the British Government, propositions for settle
ment and final adjustment, which, however, have
not proved acceptable to it. Our Minister at Lon
don has, under instructions, again brought the sub
ject to the consideration of that Government; and
while nothing will be done to compromit the rights,
or honor of the United States, every proper ex
pedient will be resorted to in order to bring the
negotiation now in progress of resumption, to a
speedy and happy termination. In the mean time
it is proper to remark, that many of our citizens are
either already established in the territory, or are on
their way thither for the purpose of forming per
manent settlements, while others are preparing to
follow,—and in view of these facts, I must repeat
the recommendation contained in previous messages,
for the establishment of military posts, at such
places, on the line of travel, as will furnish security
and protection, to our hardy adventurers against hos
tile tribes of Indians, inhabitating those extensive
regions. Our laws should also follow them, so
modified as the circumstances of the case may
seem to require. Under the influence of our free
system of government, new republics are destined
to spring up, at no distant day, on the shores of the
Pacific, similar in policy and in feeling to those exis
ting on this side of the Rocky Mountains, and
giving a wider and more extensive spread to the
principles of civil and religious liberty. *****
I communicate herewith certain despatches re
ceived from our Minister at Mexico, and also a cor
respondence which has recently occurred between
the Envoy from that Republic and the Secretary of
Stale. It must be regarded as not a little extraordi
nary that the Government of Mexico, in anticipa
tion of a public discussion, which it has been pleas
ed to infer from newspaper publications as likely to
take place in Congress, relating to the annexation
of Texas to the United States, should have so far !
anticipated the result of Buch discussion as to have
announced its determination to visit any such anti
cipateu decision by a lortnal declaration ot war
against the United States. If designed to prevent
Congress from introducing that question, as a fit
subject for its calm deliberation and final judgment,
the uxecutivAhas no reason to doubt that it will
entirely fail of its object. The Representatives of
a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehen
sion of future consequences to embarrass them in
the course of their proposed deliberations. Nor
will the Executive Department of the Government
fail, for any such cause, to discharge its whole duty
to the country.
The war which has existed for so long a time be
tween Mexico and Texas has, since the battle of
San Jacinto, consisted for the most part of preda
tory incursions, which, while they have been atten
ded with much of suffering to individuals, and have
kept the borders of the two countries in a state of
constant alarm, have failed to approach to any defin
itive result. Mexico has fitted out no formidable
armanentby land or by sea for the subjugation of
Texas.—Eight years have now elapsed since Texas
declared her independence ot Mexico, and during
that time she has been recognized as a sovereign
power by several of the principal civilized states.
Mexico nevertheless, perseveres in her plans of re
conquest, and refuses to recognise her indepen
dence. The predatory incursions to which I have
alluded, have been attended, in one instance, with
the breaking up of the courts of justice by the
seizing upon the persons of the judges, jury and
officers of the court, and dragging them, along with
unarmed, and therefore non-combatant citizens,
into a cruel and oppressive bondage, thus leaving
crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass un
reproved. A border watfare is evermore to be de
precated, and over such a war as has existed for so
many years between these two States, humanity
has had great cause to lament. Nor is such a con
dition of things to be deplored only because of the
individual suffering attendant upon it.. The effects
are far more extensive. The Creator’ of the Uni
verse has given man the Earth for his resting place,
and its fruits for his subsistence. Whatever, there
fore, shall make the first or any part of it. a scene of
desolation, affects injuriously his heritage, and may
be regarded as a general calamity. Wars may
sometimes be necessary; but all nations have a
common interest in bringing them speedily to aclose.
The United States have an immediate interest in
seeing an end put to the state of hostilities existing
between Mexico and Texas. They are our neigh
bours, of the same continent, with whom we are
not only desirous of cultivating the relations of
amity, but of the most extended commercial inter
course, and to practise all the rights of a neigh
bourhood hospitality. Our own interests are deeply
involved in the matter, since, however neutral may
be our course of policy, we cannot hope to escape
the effects of a spirit of jealousy on the part of
both of the powers. Nor can this Government be
indifferent to the fact that a warfare, such as is
waged between those two nations, is calculated to
weaken both powers, and finally to render them,
and especially the weaker of the two, the subjects
of interference on the part of stronger and more
powerful nations, which, intent only on advancing
their own peculiar views, may sooner or later at
tempt to bring about a compliance with terms, as the
condition of their interposition, alike derogatory to
the nation granting them and detrimental to the
interests of the United States. We could not be
expected quietly to permit any such interference
to our disadvantage. Considering that Texas is
separated from the United Slates by a mere geo
graphical line, that her territory, in the opinion of
many, formed a portion of the territory of the
United States, that it is homogeneous in its popula
tion and nursuitR with the adininincr States, makes
contributions to the commerce of the world in the
same articles with them, and that most of her in
habitants have been citizens of the United States,
speak the same language and live under similar
political Institutions with ourselves, this 'Govern
ment is bound by every consideration of interest as
well of sympathy,to see that she shall be left free
to act especially in regard to her domestic affairs,
unawed by force, and unrestrained by the policy or
views of other countries. In view of all these con
siderations the Executive has not hesitated to ex
press to the Government of Mexico how deeply it
deprecated a continuance of the war, and how anx
iously it desired to witness its termination. I can
not but think that it becomes the United States, as
the eldest of the American Republics, to hold a lan
guage to Mexico on this subject of an unambiguous
character.—It. is time that this war had ceased.
There must be a limit to all wars; and if the parent
State, after an eight yearB’ struggle, has failed to
reduce to submission a portion of its subjects stand
ing out in revolt against it, and who have not only
proclaimed themselves to be independent, but have
been recognised as such by other powers, she ought
not to expect that other nations will quietly look on,
to their obvious injury, upon a protraction of hostili
ties. These United States threw off their colonial
dependence, and established Independent Govern
ments ; and Great Britain, after having wasted her
energies in the attempt to subdue them for a less
period than Mexico has attempted to subjugate
Texas, had the wisdom and justice to acknowledge
their independence, thereby recognising the obliga
tion which rested on her as one of the proudest as
well as most powerful nations of the earth, it could
in no way disparage Mexico to imitate. While,
therefore, the Executive would deplore any colli,
sion with Mexico, or any disturbance of the friendly
relations which exist between the two countries, it j
cannot permit that Government to control its policy
whatever it may be, towards Texas; but will trea
her as by the recognition of her independence thi
United States have long since declared they woult
do, as entirely independent of Mexico. The higl
obligations of public duty may enforce from th<
constituted authorities of the United States a policy
which the course persevered in by Mexico will havi
mainly contributed to produce; and the Executiv<
in such a contingency, will with confidence throw
itself upon the patriotism of the People to sustair
the Government in its course of action. * * * * i
The receipts into the Treasury for the calendai
year 1843, exclusive of loans, were little more
than eighteen millions of dollars, and the expendi.
tures, exclusive of payments on the public debt
will have been about twenty-three millions of dol.
lars. By the Act of 1843, a new arrangement oi
the fiscal year was made, so that it should com
mence on the 1st day of July in each year. The
accounts and estimates for the current fiscal year,
will show that the loans and Treasury notes made
and issued before the close of the last Congress, to
meet the anticipated deficiency, have not been
entirely adequate. Altough on the 1st of Octohei
last, there was a balance in the Treasury in con
sequence of the provision thus made of $3,914,
082 99, yet the appropriations already made by
Congress will absorb that balance, and leave a
probable deficiency of two millions of dollars at
the close of the present fiscal year. There are
outstanding Treasury notes to about the amout of
four million six hundred thousand dollars; and
should they be returned upon the Treasury during
the fiscal year, they will require provision for their
redemption. I do not however regard this as pro
bable, since they have obviously entered into the
currency of the country, and will continue to form
a portion of it, if the system now adopted be con
tinued. The loan of 1841, amounting to $5,672,
976 88, falls due on the 1st of January, 1845, and
must be provided for or postponed by a new loan.
And unless the resources of revenue should be
materially increased by you, there will be a probable
deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1845, of upwards of four millions of
dollars. ********-*****
In regard to all the Departments, T am quite hap
py in the belief that nothing has been left undone
which was called for by a true spirit of economy,
or by a system of accountability rigidly enforced.
This is in some degree apparent from the fact, that
the Government has sustained no loss by the de
fault of any of its agents. In the complex, but at
the same time, beautiful machinery of our system
of Government, it is not a matter of surprise, that
some remote agency may have failed for an in
stant to fulfil its desired office ; but I feel confident
in the assertion, that nothing has occurred to inter
rupt the harmonious action of the Government it
self, and that while the laws have been executed
with efficiency and vigor, the rights neither of
States nor individuals have been trampled on or
disregarded.

advancing in all that contributes to national great
ness. The tide of population continues unbroken
ly to flow into the new States and territories, where
a refuge is found not only for our native born fellow
citizens, but for emigrants from all parts of the civ
ilized world, who come among us to partake of the
blessings of our free institutions, and to aid by their
labour to swell the current of wealth and power.**
When under a dispensation of Divine Provi
dence, I succeeded to the Presidential office, the
state of public affairs was embarrassing and critical.
To add to the irritation consequent upon a long
standing controversy with one of the most pow
erful nations of modern times, involving not only
questions of boundary which under the most favo
rable circumstances, are always embarrassing, but
at the same time important and high principles of
maritime law—border controversies between the
citizens and subjects of the two countries had en
gendered a state of feeling and of conduct which
threatened the most calamitous consequences_
The hazards incident to this state of things were
greatly heightened by the arrest and imprisonment
of a subject of Great Britain, who acting as it was
alleged, as a part of a military force, had aided in
the commission of an act violative of the territorial
jurisdiction of the Uunited States and involving the
murder of a citizen of the State of New York. A
large amount of claims against the Government ol
Mexico remained unadjusted, and a war of several
years continuance with the savage tribes of Florida
still prevailed, attended with the desolation of a
large portion of that beautiful territory, and with
the sacrifice of many valuable lives. To increase
the embarrassments of the Government, individual
and State credit had been nearly stricken down,
and confidence in the General Government was so
much impaired that loans of a small amount could
only be negotiated at a considerable sacrifice. As
a necessary consequence of the blight which had
fallen on commerce and mechanical industry the
ships of the one were thrown out of employment,
and the operations of the other had been greatly
diminished. Owing to the condition of the curren
cy, exchanges between different parts of the coun.
try had become ruinously high, and trade had to
depend on a depreciated paper currency in con
ducting its transactions. 1 shall be permitted to
congratuate the country that, under an overruling
Providence, peace was preserved without a sacri
fice of the national honor; the war in Florida was
brought to a speedy termination ; a large portion o
the claims on Mexico have been fully adjudicated
and are in a course of payment, while justice has
been rendered to us in other matters by other na
tions; confidence between man and man is in a
great measure restored, and the credit of this Gov
ernment fully and perfectly re-established. Com
merce is becoming more and more extended in its
operations, and manufacturing and mechanical in
dustry once more reap the rewards of skill and
labor honestly applied. The operations of trade
rest on a sound currency, and the rates of exchange
are reduced to their lowest amount. Iu this con.
dition of things 1 have felt it to be my duty to bring
to your favorable consideration matters of great in
terest in their present and ultimate results, and the
only desire which I feel in connection with the
future is, and will continue to be, to leave the coun.
try prosperous, and its institutions unimpaired.
