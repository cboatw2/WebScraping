FIRE.
At about one "o'clock yesterday morning
our citizens were aroused from their
sleep bv the alarm of fire?and it was to
behold the most awful calamity that has
ever visiited the town. The fire was
first discovered in the rear of the buildings
occupied by iMr. CJ, A. Magill, tailor ?
Mr. Sarnnel Kirton and the ware house
of Mr. Benjamin King. Owing to the
high wind at the North the fire spread
with great rapidity, and consumed every
building <w the privi ledge land from
Scriven to Queen Street, embracing sev?'n
i'iahLsof the merchandize in tiie town.
and all the Kriek stores, as also many of
the most valuable wooden stores. This
is the first tire of any magnitude that has
occurred in the place for the last seventy
years, and will long he remembered.?
The principal sufferers Rre
The Estate of the late Col. Win. A Is
ton, the two stores on Bav street, one
lontaining the stock of goods of the late
Maj. Wot. Chapman, the other occupied
by Mr William McNulty as tne post office?and
also the two wooden buildings
on the wharf. Most of the goods, and
the letters in the Post-Office saved.?
The Mail for Couwavborough was con
o
sumo'.

by Mr. John C. Porter, and the other by
Mr. John Ralston. No insurance on the
building. Mr. Porter's loss js estimated

store and extensive ware house, occupied
by themselves as a dry gooJs and shoe

Estate of Richard Shackelford two
brick stores and ware houses attached.
One occupied by Mr. John McKinzie as a
saddlery store, and the otHer by Mr. Jacob
Wayne as a dry goods store. Loss in
goods nothing, these being the last of the
stores consumed, We have not understood
that there was any insurance 0:1 the

(treat praise is due to Capt. Commandor
our town inarshall, and to ('apt H >wland
of the brig Juno, lor the very efti
cient service which they rendered. The
store of Messrs. Farrow 6c Son was nearIv
fire jicoof and long resisted the fury of
tiie tire and would have been preserved
11 nd the fire there arrested but for the extensive
ware hou>e iu the rear.
To prevent the .spreading of the fire
IVest from Screven aire** it was adjudged
jH-jvpef to take down our ancient Town
Hall and market place. We looked upon
the hutldiog with revureace and lamented
its destruction. It had for half* century
l.eld the counsellors of the welfare of the
tuwu, in the upper story?nnd the sustenance
of the population as a Market place
j I the lower. We remembered the remark
of ojr old friend Gen. Woodberry,
ijf Marion made to us three years ago,
AvUe*i he said lie wished to come to
Georgetown once more, rest his hody
against ihue middle pillow of our market
jpluce and review the town by the streets
which prominently opened to him the
scenes of his early life,?and look upon
tne monumental ruins of the town in the
days of the revolution- This pleasure is
denied him?hut we.shull soon resuscitate
the Town Hall, and w.e hope with native
dons.
Our Ioss has been heayy.*?but we have
places to carry on the business of the
niucc.

At 10 o'clock yestcrdnv a meeting of

K f*'ne strange as any touoded on
fiction occurred in New Orleans on the i
3d. insf. tt
It appears that a young Spaniard was f
lying in the last stages of yellow fever, t
next door to the printing office of Mr. G., f
in Chnrtres street. The physician Dr. o
B., was sent for, but before his arrival, v
the young man had ceased to live, accord- p
ing to the opinions of those in the house, s
so that when he arrived he found his pa- r
tient covered with a white linen, and re- ?
ported as dead. Tnat very eve ling tbev v
washed and cleansed the young roan, e
and having put on his burial dress, they e
laid him on his bed until the morning.? i
In the morning a coffin was got, and all n
the necessary preparations were made, r
He was then taken nnd put in his coffin. I
hut no sooner was he dropped in it than
he jumped up and asked where they c
were going to place him. They then I
conducted him in a carriage to a coloree r
nurs '-woman's house. He is yet verv t
sick, hut mov perhaps live. It appears >
t'iat he was in a state of lethargy. *

The following resolutions were offered f
htP Mr. Randall, at the Philadelphia ?
City and County Whig Meeting held on r
Monday hist, in the State House Yard. ^
Thev were received with acclamation, t
and adopted without a dissenting voice: (
Unsolved, That it is right and proper i
- - n __ _
to impose the most severe system or tax- j
ATiot. to preserve inviolate the honor
and faith of tho Slate, and that we dep. J
reeate any further recourse to loans for j
the purpose of pa ving either the principal j
>r interest of the debts now due by the <
Commonwealth. -I
Resolved, That the Legislature of t
Pennsylvania he earnestly requested to j (
compel the Bauls of this Common wealth '

forthwith to resume specie payments, ; i
or to go inio liquidation for tho payment j (
of their debts. jl
The Hon.. C. II. Ogdon, Attorney J

i stit itio i, is we doubt not deepiyand uni- '
I versally felt. The tlourishsng state of '
' the College during his administration, '
' immediately succeeding too, as it did,
such a gloomy period in' its history, the '
. place he had gained in the respect and af- j
, factions of the Students, the confidence I (
he bad inspired in the parents and guard- i ,
ians, all ?l?eak a language not to be mis-i j
understood ; und we, in common with I t
*! ? 4 l? . in fllAA u/ik filJ-* 1 I

I State has s istaincd. I<
It is quite common amcng the great i
majority of lite community to suppose 1
that tliev have very litle interest in the *
conduct or management of the College, I 1
unless they have either sons or wards j j
which they are educating, or intend tot.
educate there. But this is a mistaken i-l
idea. The South Carolina College is a | ,
public lustution?the great fountain of
learning from which has emanated and f
from wnicli is still to be executed, the f
itiiikN which are to control the State in ,
all its departments, social and legislative, i
The young men who are educated there, t
are to be dispersed throughout the State, t
and will give tone and character to the I
public opinion of the commonwealth. <
The complexion which this public opin- *
ion assumes, will greatly depend upon '
those who have the control of the College, J
and hence, the interest which every Car- 1
oilman has in the judicious selection of a 1
presiding officer of an institution of such |
mighty influence?the province of which (
is to mould the principles and ciiaracters
of the men who are to be out (uture gov- |
ernors arid law-givcrs. j
Feeling as we do, a deep interest in i
the success of this noble institution, and y
claiming the right, which every citizen i
has, of making suggestions in relation to I
i its offices, we take tiiis occasion to men- j
tiou the name of an individual) who, if (
Ive can be induced to accept the office, will 1
ewiwontjy sustain the interests, the digui- 1
ty K*d purify of the College. We allude 1
to the Hon. John Bolton O'Neal, an up- 1
rinrht Jn.W n mirrt Patriot an honest and
' ^ j
censistent Christian. Judge O'Neal is }
the man of all others, within our knowl- t
edge, bust calculated to fill i.his high res- j
jHjnsible station?possessingsou.nd intelli- ?
gQnce and good sense, firmness of prin- f
ciple and sincerity of feeding, dignity of f
person, gentleness of manners, and of I
spotless moral character. From under p
his administration we might expect an ar- v
my of graduates mingling with their feU 8
low citizens in e\ery portion of the State, v
which, in a few years would work a migh v
ty and glorious moral revolution among
our people.
We invite public attention to this sug. .
gention, and especially would we ask the t
Trustees of the College, to give it their r
consideration. ,
