entered by lecturers and declaimers, who made no
professions of religion, and who by their buffoone
ry have sometimes converted the sanctuary ot
God* into a scene of boisterous mirth and applause.
Last1 year, I think, the Methodist Church in Mid
dletown, Conn., was, pro tern converted into a
Court House, for the trial of a murderer. Thus
making it, not a‘‘den of thieves,” exactly, but, at
least, a den of lawyers. Indeed, ‘‘ the people” are
too much in the habit of looking upon our “meet
ing house's*’ as public property, to be used on all
occasions, in all possible ways. The other day, I
•was applied to by a good “churchman” for our
“ meel ing house,” to deliver a scientific lecture
Ih. I enquired if his pastor objected to his using
tlidir “church 1” ‘‘Oh yes,” said he, “there is a
canon which forbids it!” I replied, that there
was also a canon which would exclude him from
burs. And I believe that according to the letter
and spirit of our discipline, we have really no right
to devote our churches to any other than religious
purposes. By suffering them to be put to all man
. ner of uses, they finally lose their sanctity in the
- eyes of the people, and hence, the careless and
- even disorderly deportment which has sometimes
marked our congregations. I wish our church
papers and pastors would give this subject due at
tention, and try to effect a reform. Qui?

The Great Western steamer from Liverpool
brings unfavourable accounts of Cotton.—The
article had declined in Liverpool from \ to f,—this
intelligence necessarily affects our market, and
every thing with us is now quiet. Holders are
loth to yield, and buyers hold off for a correspond

operate freely. Another steamer is expected in a
day or two, when wc shall settle down on prices.
Sea Islands are said to be firm in England, and it

GENERAL INTELLIGENT E.
FOREIGN.
From the N. Y. Courier & Enquirer, April 17.
Twenty two days later from England*
The Great Western steam-ship, Capt. Matthews, ar
rived yesterday morning from Liverpool, which port she
left on the 2Uth ult.,on her first regular trip for the season,
bringing our regular London files to the 28th, and Liv
erpool papers to the day of departure. The Great Wes
tern lias experienced rough weather and adverse winds
pn almost the entire passage, which has consequently
been prolonged somewhat beyond the usual time taken
by that noble steamer to cross the Atluntic. The poli
tical intelligence is not particularly important, but the
commercial intelligence is more so, and we regret to see
some falling off in our great American staple ; cotton
haying experienced a considerable decline since the last
advices from England.
The packet ships from this port had made long passa
ges out, owing to the prevalence of strong easterly
winds. The Oxford arrived on the 21st March; the
Rochester on the 23rd, and the Indiana on the 25th,
with papers announcing the passage of the annexation
bill by the Senate, and twelve hours afterwards the
George Washington arrived with Mr. Polk’s inaugural.
This document was the subject of severe criticism, and
the passage of the Texas bill had excited a lively sensa
tion, amounting almost to astonishment, as it was not
previously believed in England that it could pass the
Senate.
number of articles and repealing it entirely on others,
had gone into operation, “and,” says Wilmer’s Times,
“a great number of free entries were passed in conse
quence for goods which have for a considerable time
been housed in the bonded warehouses, but which are
now free of duty, and the officers of the warehousing de
partment will no doubt be very busy for a time, until the
goods on hand, now declared to be free of duty, are all
delivered, when it is expected that the bulk of the free
goods imported from the present time will be delivered
direct from the quay at the side of the importing vessel,
thus doing away with the necessity of placing them at
all in the bonded warehouses.”
The Queen’s visit to Ireland, during the summer, ap
pears to have been determined on, and Mr. O’Connell
had told his followers that they must have their breath
in readiness for a lusty exhibition of groans for “Peel
and his associates," whenever they could be caught by
themselves ; but the repealers must be careful not to
groan while the Queen was present. Whenever Peel
and Graham could be found separated from majesty,
they must have plenty of “cheek music,”
On the 17th March, in the House of Commons, a
question was asked by Mr. Roebuck, whether the Gov
ernment hud any objection to lay before the House some
information respecting the Oregon negotiation. He was
prompted to ask the question because while, as he un
derstood, negotiations were in progress between the two
Governments, the House of Representatives of the Uni
ted Stales hud passed a bill for “settling” the territory
this he characterized as “an extraordinary proceeding,
und he wished for information concerning it. It was
not the wont of English people to bluster, but he trusted
this matter would be put upon a proper footing.
Sir Robert Peel replied that, us the negotiation was
still pending, it would not be consistent with his duty
to enter into any explanations or produce the correspond
ence. He would remark, however, that our relations
are with the Executive Government of America and nol
with the House of Representatives. Sir Robert agreed
that it would be quite unseemly to use any language ol
bluster or menace, but while forbearing to do so, he
hoped the House would not infer that Her Majesty’s
Government are deeply sensible of the importance of th<
subject.
Mr. Divet called attention to a recent work on Cali
fornia, by M. de Mofras, (a scientific gentleman, senl
out by the French Government, and whose book is pub
lished with the official sanction of M. Guizot and Mar
shall Soult,) in which, after examining the Oregon
question, he says of the claim preferred by the English tc
that territory, “it must be admitted that this time, reasor
and right are on their aide.”
On the 19th, in reply to a question from Mr. Aldam
Sir R. Peel took occasion to refer to a recent message o
President Tyler, expressing his (Sir Robert’s) regrei
■that the President should have thought proper to send
to Congress a formal message on the condition of no
groes captured from slave ships by British cruisers
without ascertaining the real condition of those libera
ted negroes when in the British Colonies.” He nlsr
said that if the President desired to send a Commission
into the islands to ascertain the true stale of the maun
every facility for inquiry should be nfforded to the Com
missioners. He complained that the message referred
to, alledged that these rc-captured negroes were subject
ed to an apprenticeship for u term of years, scarcely lest
severe in its actual details than slavery itself; while in
fact the state of an apprenticeship had been for sonic
years entirely abolished in the British West Indies; and
the re-captured negroes, on arriving in the islands, were
absolutely free.
Reference was also made, in the I louse, to Capl. War
ner’s recent proposition, respecting the use of hisengiues
of destruction. He offers to destroy, at his own ex
pense, at a distance of five miles, a line of battle ship, tc
be provided by Government; admitting on board his
vessel, and to nil inspection of the process by which the
end is achieved, three or four persons, including Sir Ro
bert Peel and the Duke of Wellington. The Premier
stated, that since thcae projects of destruction had
become subjects of discussion, offers of a similar nature
had crowded upon him from various sources; the propo
sers stipulating for various rewards, ranging from £50,
000 to £‘250,000. He nevertheless seemed to inlimntc
that some arrangement might be effected between the
Government and Captain Warner.
The efTect of the annexation proceedings in Congress
and the tone of the President’s Inaugural Message res
pecting both Texas and Oregon was to depress the buoy
ant feeling which had sprung up in regard to American
Stock, and private letters express apprehension that the
former distrust will recur.
The London Sun speaks of the consummation as no
more than “might have been anticipated from the mo
ment that emigrants began to occupy land in that exten
sive district.” It says the policy of the Government has
been to extend its territory, and with ao contemptible a
government as that of Mexico, Texas could not long be
an exception to the general law.—But says the Sun.
“The Americans will not stop there. The pressure
from within will only increase with the increase of pop
ulation, and unless some strong cause intervene, wheth
er from the interference of other powers, or the opposi
tion of the Northern Stales, Mexico itself will soon be
swallowed by this unscrupulous and enterprising peo
ple. The bigoltcd, priest ridden, and indolent descend
ants ofthe Spaniards have no chance with the active,
industrious and warlike Saxon race. The accession of
power given to the Southern States by this event is not
at all welcome to those of the North, and may yet lead
to important consequences.”
Tlie Times of the 27th ult. comments, very severely
on the consummation of annexation in Congress. It
seems to be not at all surprised, since it has always been
clear that the muss of the Union was in favor of the
measure. But in the manner in which it was finally ac
complished, 'in the very point of time between two
presidentships,’ it finds matter for remark. Mr. Ty
ler's determination 'to do something before he dies,’ the
eagerness of the House, like a silk worm, to lay its eggs
before it dies ; the haste of the Senate, and the despatch
of the new President in sending off envoys and instruc
tions to Texas, arc all successively the theme of com
ment.
Referring to President Polk’s language touching our
unquestionable right to Oregon, the Times has this re
mark
But it may spare time likely to be consumed in a very
unprofitable dieouBnion, if we cjtprcoo nn opinion, at
least as decided as his own, that in spite of his maraud
ers, and what he terms his constitutional rights, the ter
ritory of the Oregon will never be wrested from the Bri
tish Crown, to which it belongs, but by wur. Mr. Polk
avers, that to enlarge the limits of the Union is to ex
tend the dominion of peace over additional teiritories
and increasing millions , but he will find that when they
are so far extended ns to include the rightful possessions
of the British empire, they will encounter the hostility
and the resolution of a people not inferior to the popu
lnceofthe United States in spirit or in resources.
The public appetite for horrors, has been sufficiently
pandered to of late. ■ Murders, trials, convictions and
executions, have followed close upon each other in all
parts of the country. The young man Tapping, recent
ly convicted of the murder of his sweet-heart, Raima
Whiter, was hanged on Monday last, admitting upon
the scaffold the guilt, which up to that moment he had
steadfastly denied. Tawell, the poisoner of Sarah
Hart, was this morning executed at Aylesbury ; and
he too, at the last hour, confessed that lie had not only
committed the murder for which he died, but had made
the attempt to do 90 in September last, of which he was
suspected. Hooker the supposed murderer of Mr. De
laruc, at Hampstead, is in Newgate, awaiting his trial,
and was present in the prison chapel, when “the con
demned sermon” was preached on Sunday last to Tap
ping.
C IRST tlHlIIVAI. Cl' OUO.tR FROM THE U . STATES.—Oil
the 9th inst., the American ship Franconia arrived in
Liverpool, bringing as part of her cargo, twelve hogs
heads of Louisiana sugar. This is the first urrival of
American grown sugar in this country.
In England, owing to the decreased duties, sngur for
home had declined—a slight rise in foreign sugar had
occurred, and on the complete opening of the naviga
tion to the North of Europe, more activity was looked
for. In St. Petersburgh the stocks arc spoken of as
large—in other parts of the north they are smaller than
usual.
| The state of the Sugar market in Europe, about which
there is a good deal of sensitiveness here, was animated,
but without any considerable transactions.”
After the severest winter which this country has
known for mnny years,—severe both in temperature and
duration,—a change for the belter has taken place within
the last few days, and winter seems fast giving way tc
spring.
Curreapondcnce of the Courier &- Enquirer,
Paris, March 34,1845.
Europe is in a stale of profound peace, yet in the di
rection of Switzerland preparations for war are obser
vable. In England, too, real and important efforts un
in progress to create and fit nut a steam Navy, never yei
equalled. Why should free and happy Switzerland oc
casion uneasiness, and suggest apprehensions for tin
mointainance of this general Peace 1 Why should
England go to the trouble and expense of preparing t
Steam Fleet at the moment when the speech of hei
Sovereign on opening the session of Parliament, stalet
that she continued to receive from all foreign States anc
Powers assurance of the most perfect amity 1
The reply to the first of these questions is easy_The
second you are in a condition to answer yourself.
Switerland is in the full enjoyment of rational liberty
There are in Switzerland, however, foreign and nativi
“perturbed spirits,” who will not suffer her to remain a
rest,—ultra Republicans, who, in possession of thi
substance search for a refinement of Freedom beyonc
the imagination of rational man.
I do not mean to contend that the organization of thi
Helvetic Republic is that which its citizens would nov
create, if it were done anew ; but her constitution, sucl
at it is, secures liberty to all, and the interest of thi
surrounding States and Governments is to maintaii
Switzerland free, independent and happy. Several o
the cantons are eminently Catholic. These admire ant
I encourage the Jesuits. Others are Protestants or Deists,
I and Ultra-Republican, and make the presence of the
Jesuits the pretext for attempting to change the Federal
I form of Government, and substitute fur it a more firm,
compact, manageable Republic. The object would not
be a bad one, if tile necessity for the change were ob
vious or pressing, which it is not.
I will not follow the movements of the ultra liberals—
the anti-Jesuits, the free corps or the demagogues,
through alt the recent scenes in Switzerland, but will
come to the great facts. The attempt to effect a compro
mise has failed. England, Prance, Austria and Prus
sia, have respectively advised or admonished Switzer
land in these circumstances. The Pope has even been
prevailed upon Indirect or sanction the withdrawal of
the Jesuits from the Swiss cantons, but these efforts have
been, and will it is feared, be unavailing. The Diet has
adjourned, sine die, and outrage and violence seetn again
to threaten the confederation. Austria, France and Sar
dinia are, however, on the alert, and have collected ar
mies on the frontiers of Switzerland, so that on the first
symptom of civil war within, an invasion of thccantons
will take place from without.
1 am not sure that this affair Ims much interest for
you. In Europe it is regarded us important, because of
its capability to bring about a general war.
You do not require from Paris tbe details of what
England is doing in the way of Naval preparation.
Neither is it necessary that you be informed from hence,
that those preparations have only one immediate objeot,
to meet the war that would inevitably ensue upon the
unfavorable terminations now proceeding between the
British and American Governments. To be nlarmed
and frightened by the apparent possibility of a just and
necessary war with Great Britain, or any other power,
is not in your nature, but it is quite in your character to
avoid plunging heedlessly and headlong into a sea of
trouble, to emerge from which successfully, creditably
and advantageously, would be no matter of course. The
recapitulation of all that England is doing with an eye
to the unfavorable termination of those negotiations, is
the province of my colleague in London, but confirma
tory evidence, (at least assurances,) that those measures
have only America for their object, will not be superflu
ous or unacceptable, however unpleasant, to you.
The anti-English—and that means in fact, the entire,
Press of France, naturally lean towards America in
these circumstances, and few only among them deprecate
war, but it is not very probable that America will, in
the arrangement of her differences with England, take
into consideration the desires of the French Press, which
was, at no very remote period, as hostile to the just and
equitable satisfaction of American claims on France, as
at present to the Government of “ perfidious Albion.”
The enemies of England regurd as promising nil the
indications of hostility to be found in the American
papers. Mav all their anticipations be falsified !
MAHCJII ~(i.
Our Swiss letters received to-day (of 22d insl.)ae
rather threatening in their character. • They mention
the possibility of an outbreak in Lucerne that would
overturn the existing Government nnd form of Govern
ment. The affair nppears so grave that the French
Minister to the Cantons (M. Ponlois) is on his way to
Paris to assist at the deliberations of the French Gov
ernment nnd of the Ambassadors of Great Britain,
Austria and Prussia on the subject. An outbreak would
sadly precipitate matters.
The French Ministry is determined to remain in
power and to dissolve the Chamber, having, it is surmised,
(and they believe,) managed to ensure that in the new
one they will have a great ma jority. This expectation
does not seem well founded ; but they arc, in spite of
daily defeats and rebuffs, resolved upon the trial.
A new campaign in Africa is resolved on. The ne
cessity for it is very clear. The Opposition papers
contend that it will be undertaken merely to enable the
King’s youngest son, the Duke dcMontpensier, to gather
cheap laurels. It would appear, on the other hand, that
the redoubtublc Abd*Kl Kinder is seriously resolveil upon
an effort to seize upon the throne of Morocco.
France is more tranquil thnn it Ims been these six nnd
fifty years. Spain is miraculously quiet and absolutely
thinking about her affairs. If she had an able, an active,
and above all honest Ministry, Spain would ere long re- j
sunte her station among the nations of the universe.
Austria is becoming feebler daily. Prussia is rather !
unsettled. The Emperor of Russia is indisposed.
I
Italy is, per force,quiet. There is, however, an under
current of discontent that cannot full, sooner or later, to '
lead to great events.
Turkey is making an effort to protract her existence,!
and is displaying more energy than she appeared to j
have left her. Greece is proceeding satisfactorily, i
Egypt is not improving. Syria will, it is hoped, be pa- 1
cified, through the representations of the Christian Euro- '
pean powers to the Porte.
Your great countryman, Tom Thumb, is the lion of j

Railroad speculation is so much the rage that dealing

Tremendous Confi.aiiration.— 'I'u'cnly squares of Ike
City in ruins! !—/rom one thousand to one thousand
tioo hundred houses destroyed i—Loss estimated at ten
millions!
It is our painful duty to record one of the roost terri
ble fires that ever devastated any city on this continent—
a great portion of our busy and populous town is in !
ruins. More houses have been destroyed by this single j
and horrible conflagration, than have been consumed by j
all the fires that have ever occurred in the city before, j
Those acquainted with the plan of Pittsburgh will j
realize the extent of the terrible calamity we have suf
fered, when we state that nearly all that part of the 1
city extending from Ferry-street up the Mon. river to j
the city line, and thence to the head of the entire suburb ;
called “Pinctown" (Kensington) has been destroyed. !
The fire reached ttp Market street, as far as the south
side of Third street, and up Wood street ns far us the
South side of Diamond Alley. The boundaries of the
burnt district may be thus described.—From Water
street up Ferry to Third Street, (the 3d Presbyterian
Church was saved,) up Third to Wood ; up Wood to
Diamond Alley, both sides j up Diamond Alley to
Smithfield street, and thence down Smithficld to Fourth
street, (both sides,) up Fourth street to Ross street, und
thence to the head of Pipetown—including, us we have
estimated above, about 20 squares, und comprising from
10 to 1200 houses—many of the warehouses containing
goods of immense value—they were grocery, dry goods,
and commission houses, and their spring slocks had
i just been laid in.
The fire originated in a frame building over an ice
: house, belonging to Wm. Diehl, near the corner of Se
cond and Ferry streets. The wind was blowing stiffly
from the northwest, though it frequently veered to other
! points, endowing toils variation, the fire extended up
Wood street further than it otherwise could have done,
i It was first discovered about 12 o’clock, and was not
■ materially checked till 5 in the afternoon—even while
i we write, (at 9 o'clock P. M.) the engines arc playing
f vigorously in Wood-street.
We can give no adequate idea of the distress which
pervades our stricken community. The progress of the
Hames was so fearfully rapid lhat many persons had
not time to remove their goods—others, again, had got
iheir proffer!y into the street, when the flames seized it
there, before it could be removed 10 a place of safety.
Others, still, would not believe the devouring element
could reach their dwellings, and did not think of re
moving until if was too late tosuve their furniture. And
we saw many people, who escaped with nothing hut the
apparel they had upon their persons. At dark, you
might see, in every direction, families silting without
shelter, guarding such port ’ ns of their household furni
ture aslticy were able to s#nre from the flames, and not
knowing where they would luy their heads, or procure
a morsel of food. Of course the kindness of their more
fortunate fellow citizens did much to alleviate their suf- ,
firings, and wc believe, all were provided for as well
as the meluncholy nature of affairs would allow.
“It is impossible to calculate the loss. Merchants,
Mechanics, Workingmen—all, all have been ruined.
Nor do we believe that the Insurance offices will ever be I
able to pay one hundredth part of the property insured by
them. Iluin—ruin stares hundreds of families in the j
face, that yesterday morning rose from their beds witli I
plenty of this world’s goods, and they have now no |
place to lay their heads, or bread for themselves and j
children. May God protect and help them.
About eighteen entire squares are destroyed entirely,
and many parts of squares. The steamboats on the
Monongahela hud to move to be saved from the flames.
The wharf was covered with groceries and all kinds
of Pittsburgh manufactures. A great portion of these
goods were burned ; and a vast amount destroyed by j
the immense crowd of drays, &c. working their way |
among them.
The Post Office and adjoining buildings, northeast
corner of Third and Market have been saved. Every
thing valuable, however, was removed from the stores,
printing offices, &c. in the block. The letters, &c, were
taken from the Post Office.
From the place where the fire commenced to where it |
was arrested, is about a mile and a quarter.
The iron safes, upon which business men depended
for the preservation of their books, papers, &c. and all,
so far as our observation extends, were destroyed, ex- j
cept a few wc noticed having been rolled out before the 1
destruction of the buildings. I
We can give no idea, on paper, of the distress which
prevails—thousands are left destitute—men who yester
day were worth thousands, are now bankrupt. It lias
been estimated lhat the burnt district contains sixtv !
acres! The total loss, in dollars, cannot be arrived at
witli any kind of accuracy—suy guess at twelve mil
lions ! This is probably near it. All the insurance
offices are broken up—they will not be able to pay two
percent. Only about 15,000 dollars were taken in In
surance companies in other cities ”—Pittsburgh Post.
Tub Gulp Squadron.—War with Mexico.—The
papers received by the mail yesterday confirm the report
that the squadron about to sail for the Mediterranean
had received countermanding orders, and thutthc vessels
comprising it will proceed to the Gulf of Mexico as speed
ily as they can be got ready for sea. This is a wise
measure of precaution on the part of government, and
one which, if it does not put n damper upon the bellige
rent disposition of Mexico, will at least afford security
to American commerce in peril of Mexican ciuisers,
and at the same time concentrate u force along the coast j
capable of redressing promptly any wrongs that may be |
committed against United States citizens. . A more ,
circumspect examination of our files, received by the j
Water Witch, induces us to regard the hostile speeches i
made in the Mexican Congress in a more serious light j
than as the customary ebullition of a war fever which*
periodically exhausts itself in grandiloquence. Congress
and the people, judging from the tone of our exchanges '
are disposed to a rupture of the peaceable relations be- }
tween the two powers, and the Government, now that j
Sunta Anna lias begun to bully it, covers its humility '
by raising a dust about annexation. The Santa Anna
parly might be readily suppusedto take the war side of
the question, as the deposed tyrant imagines that in case
of actual hostilities his military reputation will procure
his release and place him m the head of the army—thus
opening to his view ouce more, the Chief Magistracy
by « process and under circumstances that will establish
his authority more securely than ever.—*Y. O. l*iccnj

Turnpike through Winnsboro,* Chester, York,&c.
—We learn that a meeting on the subject of the Turn
pike through Winnsboro’ to the North Carolina line
was held at Chester Court House last week, and a spirit
of enthusiasm manifested by the citizens of that District
which aigues favorably for the success of the enterprise.
The meeting was addressed by Col, Wm.C. Preston
of this place, and several gentlemen of Chester, and a
Committee appointed to cooperate with the Columbia
Committee, and similar Committees in the other Districts,
to curry out the undertaking.

One Wheeled sui.kev.—The Petersburg ^Vu.) Intel
ligencer, in reply to a cotemporary whoexpressed some
doubts as to the existence of such u vehicle, says:—We
saw the Sulkey, and, in common with every one who
did sec it, were convinced of its utility. It can be con
structed at less cost than any other description of Sulkey,
and driven with safety and speed over roads which
would be impassable by the ordinary Sulkey. Mr. Rea
mington (the inventor,) has driven it thousands of miles
without the slightest accident, and is ready at any time
to test its advantages as compared with other Sulkies,
Petrifaction.—A petrified corpse was found ut Ber
tliier, Canada, a few days ago. Some workmen who
had occasion to remove several coffins, in excavating for
the enlargement of the church ut that pluce, came upon
one of unusual hardness, and on striking it, it split into
pieces, disclosing a body thoroughly preserved and
turned to stone. The remains are those of u Mrs. Mor
rison, who died about twenty years ago, and was buried
beneath the floor of the church. A small running stream
passed beneath the coffin, and to its effects this singular
preservation of the corpse and coffin is to be traced.
Religion in the Navy.—There was an unusual atten
dance at Divine service in the Navy-Yard in Philadel
phia, on Sunday morning. Besides the seamen, ma
rines and officers attached to this station, there was a
large number of the residents of Southwark in attend
ance. Religion existed merely in name in the Navy
Yard, until the present Commodore was stationed in it.

Artificial Arm.—A tailor by the name of William
Dodd, informs the Boston Transcript, that having lost
his right arm below the elbow joint, he had manufactured
a very simple artificial arm which looks tpuite natural,
and has enabled him since July last, to make with it 52
coats of various descriptions, 20 pair of pants and a
general assortment of work. He is very willing to
shew it to any one who has had a like misfortune.
Lunatic Asylum.—Miss Dix, the well known phi
lanthropist, has been as highly successful in Pennsyl
vania and New Jersey us in other Stoles, in producing
a favorable impression upon the law making powers,
with regard to the situation of lunatics. Pennsylvania
has passed a law appropriating $50,000—and New Jer
sey one, appropriating $10,000, for tire erection of Luna
