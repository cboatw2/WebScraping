- -
dor Gin, no other knd having hern in use piev?u*
to this patent; and whether single or donblV, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 520 to ItiOsaws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trasli, dirt, Ac. before it can teach the
saws, and bj the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gincd state, before it descends to the saw By a
verv simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
games, <>n which the hoppers rest, a'.d through
which the teeth ol the feeders pass, they can be
made to teed slow or last to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon eneli other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as enable the planter to run one
or but h at pleasure, although embraced with feeders, I
Ac. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and ;
may he propelled by horse, sleain, or water power. |
It may nlso be propelled by iron running gear.
The force rcquiredlo work it, is about the same ob
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in
the common Gin. This Gin lias been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their genernl approbation
Several gentlemen have been ho kind as to give
the Patentee their written opinion tespecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

... ?uii, in rt-jny 10 your enquiry,
what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I hnve
to Hay, that I saw it work on. Snturdny the 25th inst.
and was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process,
appeared to me to be better and clenner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, Arc.

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the ngcnlp,
of planters 'n nny of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting States, at the above prices, the ngents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !hc amount of the Gin.
It is desirable,\\ hen planters give orders for Gins,
they should accompany them with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
&c. It is found they difler in opinion. Feme
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches ; but. some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or 6 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 0 teeth to the
inch, while oilers want 10 or 11. With so nmch
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, iurniuh a statement of their wishes,
nno iijc mniiiitnct urercrs cori fuliil tlioin in every
particular. Where it is lett to our discretion, wn
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order ran be executed, from the lime it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of Iko
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all *'rder?
ought to be in the hands of the mou,,flcturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
