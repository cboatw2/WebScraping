FRIDAY EVENING. NOVEMBER 22, 1839.
Wo undo rstaflf that Mr. Mills the State
Engine ir, lately msda a# examinati >n of the
I'ee Dee (rota this place doiiro u far aa the contrart
of Messrs. Gregg and Marsha 1 for clear,
ing it out, und?r the appropriation of 1837,
extended; sad finding the work faithfully
executed according to contract, received it.
At the worst shoals, these near the mouth of
Thompson's Creek, *?m learn that the water
is now at least six inches deeper than at toon
of the other* lower iW*. Fhii all wo have
been able to leartwhdd lUS'a no doubt that tha
work has been faithfully done, and, unlike too
much of the works paid for from the pub ic
treasury, at a moderate price. " Aa much has
been accomplished aa could be,' with the
amount appropriated. But the amount w as
much less than the fair proportion of the Pee
I Deo country from the appropriations made
for work* of internal improv raent in the s'ate.
II *d it been larger, however.it is not improhablo
that Icsa work would have been done, and Ices
benefit been derived in proportion to the
amount expended. The Tee Dee country hae
Just claims for further appropriations from the
legislature, which we hope it will press at a

presented at a proper time, will doubtless*
be candid'y considered.

in fovor of the Whigs, but by a few thou,

ballot of the two house* is put down a 1*2 to
20. Mr. Tallmadge will therefore be rc-electea
te the U. 8. Senate.
MasaacuusBTTa.?Tli* atate election took
place in th s stale la?t week ; full returns
have not yet reached us, but from those received,
it appears that if Moston, the administration
candidate for Governor has not been
elected over Governor Everett, he has com
very near it. From all wo ran fearti however
the election seemed to turn upon other questions
than national politic*. Gov. Everett
\va9 open y committed in favor of the "fifteen
gallon law" or the law which prohibits the
sale of anient spirits in less quantities than lH
gallons. All topers and a large proportion of
temperate drinkers too, of course, opposed his
election; and this question produced mors
excitement in many if not most parts of the
state than any other. Gov. Everett was also
obnoxious to the abolitionists who are numerous
in the state ; and the most of them are said to
have voted for Morton. These men, however,
being once associated with the Administration
party in a warm contest may possibly continue
to act with thorn in future elections. Abbot
Lawrence is elected to Congre-t from the ,
Boston district in the place of Mr. Fletcher
resigned, and Mr. Bake.*, to supply a vacancy
in another district, caused by the death of Mr.
Alvord. The two members elect are Whigs,
as were also their predecessors.
Mi**it?ipp* Election.?The State Election
took place in Mississippi early in the present
month. Wo have seen accounts from only
eight counties ; in these the Whigs have Inst
7 members and gained 2, compared with the
last election ; making a clear loss of ft. At
this ra e the Administration party are likely
to hive the majority in the State.
It will be seen >y a Nemi-olfiaal article eo- >
pied into a preeedirg column, from the Army
and Navy Chronicle, that the Government
have determined, for the present at least, ts
discontinue oflensivn operations against the
Scin notes, and to act merely on the defensive.

without having ever seen a silk worm in
