PENFIELD, GRaEN Co., GA.,
July 8, 1844.
To the Hon. G. M. Taour:
Dear Sir-As State Rights men who
have ever looked up to you as a politician
of stern integrity not to the glory of Casar,
but the wt elfare of Rome, and who ever
regarded 'you as the fair exponent of our
creed-now that new issues are being
made-now when the Northern Whigs are
congratulating the South for having "ac
knoteledged and agreed to thie great doc.,
trine ofprotection to the labor of the country
is a political axiom cf the highest impor
tance"-now that Congressmen from the
South have for the first time openly ad
vocated and supported the protective poli
cy, and now hope that the people will
sustain them in this momentous change.
Believing that you never swerved to the
right or left of sound Republican principles
-that after having stood at the helm of
State at a time that tried man's souls;
warding off with the sovereign arm of
Georgia the combined shafts of federalism
that were aiming to crush the liberties of
the country by destroying State distic
ions and consolidating all power in the
G3eneral Government-that now in yodr
retirement nothing could induce you to
ralter or recede from your long cherished
opinions, we call upon you who yet regard
ibe doctrines of our party in '33, which
were practically enforced by yourselfin '25,
a the only guarantees to constitutional
liberty, and respectfully ask your views
apon the following questions.
1st. Is not the tariff of '42 a faithless
violation of the compromise act of'33, un
constitutional, unequal in its operations in
taxing the many for the benefit of the few
and prejudicial to Southern rights and
Southern interests.
2d. Are those Representatives of Geor
gia who have advocated and voted for the
continuation of the tariff of 1W2, worthy
of the support of Republican State Rights
men ?
3d.What policy should State Rights men
of the South putsue in our present difficult
:ircumstances.
Respectfully, your obedient servants,
A. JANES.

VALDOSTA, ILAUIENS COUNTY,
Sept. 6, 1844.
Gentlemen-Nothing has postponed an
answer to your late letter but the belief of
the w6rthiessness of my opinions, of whith
you ask my expression-I give them 6
you now, because I have, though very re
luctantly, giveo them to others.
My own judgment has brought mejo
the conclusion, not to be easily shakten
that if my opinions had been of any, the
east value, the people of Georgia would
never have exchanged their Republican
principles tor the Old Essex-Junto Feder
slism !as inconsistent with those principles
as with their rights, fiberties, and interests
of every kind.
1st. On the subject of matinufactures, my
reading of the Constitution fron its con
text. has been this:-Congress shAll have
power to regulate commerce, but Congress
shall have no power to interferein any
msnnet *hatsoever, with any other in
lusify. either agrlcttlittal de tiarftvtii
ing, exceptitdg in . gfadtidg di limited
imes to authors and inventors the exclu
iive right to their respective writings and
:iscoveries. The power to regulate. com
iterce is not an absolute power-it is lin
Ited t- the comuerce with foreiga natious
Get w~ef the Etates, adid *iil the indian
tribes-a power over the commterce be
tween individuals is not given, ad is, of
course, prohibited. The power to en :
:ourage them in any manner it pleases,
but is limnited in the, particulars of mode and
time, " by securing for .limited times to
authors and inventoris the exclusive right
to their tespectie ejriings and djef
cries." liaving thus carefully prescribed
limhastions' to limnited powers over indus
try, 'how it' is. conceivable that the Con
vention intended to give absolutie and un
limited power over all industry, or that if it
intended to give absolute power over man
tifacturing industry, or that it intended that
such powrers, being merely incidectal to
tome other powers, would be fairly dedu
ible by construction or impliestion'1t
SNow, .gentlemen, I contend .for this
reading of the Constitution, becauseITitn
slst that no covnto ever held, or widen
ever can be hotden. would giveio' liit
ed government ant absolute power over the
industry of the country-. poer tre or

branch of industry, is the same thing 8s
giving no support to any, or rather a great
deal -worse; for the money of A is taken
from the pocket of A to support the indus
try of B. and the money from the pocket
of -B to support-the industry of A. Both
A and H will say this is folishness,-bet
ter let us keep our money to encourage
each his own industry, because, Isi, you
give us the trouble of putting our hands in
our pockets so oflen for nothing, and, sec
ondly, because we have to pay the tax
collector, who has nd industry of his own
for receiving money from one and paying
it over to the other. Do you believe it
possible, I mean, for any convention to
grant a power to Congress to tax the whole
country at pleasure for the support of New
England manufacturers 1 You know this
would be done, and yet you know tnis is
the very thing that is done. A State has
the power to lay taxes to encourage indus
try--why? because a State has all power
nor probibited. But what State has exer
cised the po*erof levying taxes ta:e
courage niaufactures? States haveigran
ed charters incorporation fur this purpose,
but have in a spirit tfjustice, granted them
equally to all who, under like circum
stances, applied fot them. The parlia
ment of England possesses the unlimited
power to encourage industry, hedause it
prssesses all power without limitation;
and how has it exercised this power? By
taxing all industry for the support. of each
-each for the support of all? Englatid
like the States, acts in a spirit of impartial
justice. If she taxes A for the honefit of B,
she equally taxes B for the support of A.
So that there every body is taxed-it is
not for manufactured only, but for every
kind of industry; for you know she has her
corn laws but in all this, England, although
she he unwise, is impartial, just,, and
equitable. She never refuses to B the
measure conceded to A. But would you
take England for a model, and give to
Congress the unlimited power over human
industry whic belongs to the British Par.
fiament? I see nothing to be gained by
following this example. I think I see a
great deal to be saved by avoiding it. The
taxation' of every thing, under this system,
in England, which their statesmen would
lie glad to get rid of, is so great, that the
prices of :hings that make up the neces
saries, and comforts, and luxuries of life,
rise in proportion and make her the dutr
est, when otherwise she would have been
the cheapest country in Europe. Th
consequeneekis, that when a rich man there
happens to fill into poverty he Oeci to the
continent, where the taxes being lower, he
lives cheaper, and hascomparative com
fort and enjoyment.
I make these statements, gentlemen, to
show what your own Congress is doing
under a limited constitution, having but a
very partial and limited power over hu
.man industry, and what England is Jroing
with an absolute and unlimited power over
the same object. The one is unjustly and
oppressively taxing one portion of the
country for the benefit of another, the
other is taxing, however foolishly, yet cer
inly more fairly, all for the benefit of all.
If Congress has pb*er over manufac
turing, it has equal power over commer
cial and agricultural industry, and if it has
a power over taxa)ion to support and cher
ish the one, it has an equal power of taxa
tion is not confimed to duties on hnported
goods. It must comprehend every des
cription of taxa-ion direct and indirect.
Surely it will not be said that Congress
has an especial power to encourage man
ufacturing industry, Itirt of encouraging it
by indirctt tates atone. The genius of
lrotedtion has not adventured to much.
Now let us see, gentlemen, wvhat would
lie thre reguftof a direct system of taxation.
We have a poor farmer, who, with cotton
at 6 cents, is scarcely able to buy a second
shirt to his back. The tax collector comes
and asks a return upon oath of all the tax
a'ble article lhe has consumed, cot too bag
ging, salt, sugar, iron, molasses, &e. The
farmer says he has never yet paid for the
encouragement of the industryof the man
ufacturer in making them, and for this lie.
must pay according to law, if it cost him
the bed of his wife and children. But
have yen brought nothingin return, re
joins the farmer, for the encouragement of
*my industry ? My'industry is as 'vatua
-ble as their's. If thre tat man says tio, tile
famrseyes are at once opdned- to: the
bejpties of the American system. -The
illusions of party are dispelled.. He sees
for the first tine clearly that he'is payimrs
try the sweat of his ifrote to stupport people
tNMassachusetts and -Ohioa lthott get
ting anything .in retuftugand that if he does
getrany thing in retUrn, 'it is the merest

that both of those have to paf the tax
deallectore w bo does :otiui4 itt collect

and from C and:D,' to pity oer to 'A and

uconstitutional in te degree that it Is un
jt5t and oppressive. So long as this poor
man is connected with party, and the tax
is indirect, lie can be made. to believe,
either that nobody pays it, :or that it falls.
on the shoulders of the importer. A like.
kind of dialogue happens, gentlemen.
whenever a tariffsystem is to be patc6bd
up in Congress, the process is called "L4g
Rolling," if you help me,.1 %ill h yl~jou.
The man of Boston, says to themnnao of
Lousisfana, if you vote fihty pe ent
for iny cotton cloth, I winvote fity.per
cent for your sugar-ygeedsays the
other; but the cotton 'fantbt must bae
a word. What wiiie give me f'oi
my industry? Whj will give you
flifty per cent -likeis'e. If the cotton
planter is ninny!d' says agreed, and
gives his vote ztdanioIgly fI he~ hap.
pens to be as cuilnigias the dther. he says
no gentlemen, unless you cati pay me. t
some other waye ivote against you. -You
will certainlyi gt~ yoni 50 percent, in gbod
-sterling moneybecause a rreat. deal of
-otton dloth, and a great deal of sugar
ill be imported aed' of coutse a great
deal of duty paid; I will get niothinig but
paper and moonshi., because ther will
be no cotton imported, and of coutse-no
duty paid.. This isprecisely the relation
in which practically these parties stand. to
each other- now. If the governrent
iutend the Bostn tfiantifactuter,' and the
Louisiana sugar planiir to have in good
faith the full benefit of the 50 per cent,
duty, it must take care if they do not get
it one way they shall get another-in the
ordinary course of things-they can only
get it by enhitanced'price of cotton cloth,
and sugar. the consequence of the duty
if as the protectionists contend there is no
enhancement of price; then the cloth-mau
and the sugar-man receive no benefit. If
as they further contend that so; from
enhacement their is reduc'ioi o price,
then the manufacturer and rroducer a
tain loss instead of hecefit, and lose in pro
portion to the redaction of price. What
is then the ob'vious duty add indispensible
obligation of govetniddnt 1 Certainly to
siake good the benefit of the 50 per cent,
i d some other way-the only other way
ldft IN to ptovide that from the duties on
.sugar and cotton cloth there shall first be
paid id the Massachtisetts and Louisiada
rmen, the full amount of 50 per cent on the
value of the yard of cloth4 and a pound of
sugar produced by them-but if the duties
aforesaid should prove insufficient for this
purpose then the deficiency to he made
good frorn any other monies in the Trea
sury not otherwise appropriated. Now
here would be a blow up. Here for the
first time the cotton planter would come in
for his 50.pef ceni,, dud here, for the first
time in the practical operation of the sys
tem, would there be the slightest mani
festation of equality or justice. But at
the very moment ef this m:tnifestation the
manufacturer seeing that he must contri
bute to the treasury to enable the govern
mefitJ8 pay the cotton planter 5U per
cent, on the value of every pound of cotton
he makes, he is the first zo withdraw from
the American system.
Thus it is, gentlemen. that this protee
tive policy is such a mniserable and wretch
ed business; that whatever mode you re
sort to carry it into emIect with any seeming
regard to equality, is so fraught with in
justiceoadd frequently with f(lly and ab
srdity that it requires the passiveness of a
Russian slave to hear with it. Different
from this is a tariff of low duties for reve
nue only. Whatever may be the degree
of inOqulity and injustice inseparable
fronr it. is exempt frorff that severity of
oppression which is sure to be followed
by compliant and discontent. It creates
competition without giving uionopoly-itr
festrains importation to the extent of ailbr
ding ntode'rame profits, and sufficeiently re
wards industry without building up large
factories. In One, as its hardships are not
worth complaining about, there is no conm
plaint. In some itnstances, the State have
had recourse to premi'ums and bouIIfies to
encourage particular manufactures in their'
incipient stages. Whenever any of them
shall adopt the system on a large scale;
whether they do it wisely or unwisely, the
people seeing and kowing exactly what
they pay, and having taxed themselves
with their eyes open, and will have no right
to complain.
Whren tihe decnstitutiou granted the pow
to ray duties it was not for protection of
atnufactures, or it would have :said so
'but "topay the debts and provide for the'
common defence. and general welfare."'
If the powver to protect manufactures is
is derivable from the general welfare, sois.
