pondents of the press of a cabal at Wash.
. tngton that was endeavoring to excite;
difficulties between the President and his |
cabinet. The names of certain members
of Congress hare been mentioned as con*
nected with this cabal. Wc have given
little heed to these imputations; for we
have doubted Fhether the President would
lend his ear to irresponsible counsellors,
and least, of all to such counsellors as some
whose names are reported. The recent
movements indicate at least, if they do
*' not demonstrate, that a cabal of a differ
ent composition hat* been tampering?not
with the President, but?with ihe cabinet
ministers, and has at length compelled
them to resign. There is no longer any
doubt that the question of a National
Bank is the question on which a formidable
opposition to the President is about
to be organized, and that Messrs. Ewing,
Badger, Bell, and Crittenden, threw up
their offices in a tit of ill humor, because
the President i* opposed to sweh un institution.
We have long hren aware that
?0 certain quarters, a man's opinions in
.. .? Tegaril to a "Fiscal Agent" were decisive
?of the legitimacy of his claims to the
character of a Whig; hut it was not till
i? the news of the actual resignations of the
cabinet officers reached us, that we supposed
the line was to be so soon and so
distinctly drawn.
The Xod York Herald is the pnper in
which the confidential transactions of
President Tylkr's Cahinet, and the purpo?esofthe
President himself in regard to
the hank bills, while the bills were still in
- tiis hands, were first given to the public.
The paper is certainly one of the basest
*nd most unscrupulous in the country.
We copy from it the following brief paragraphs,
as specimens of its style.
* The second veto message of the glorioils
and resolute "Captain Tyler," which
we published exclusively yesterday morning
in our third regular edition, raised a
terrible shout of desperation in Wall street |
?a wailing and crying like the cries of
the damned?a swearing and cursing that
surpassed the mob of a State's prison
ju*t let loose?a hideous yell of despair
among the speculators and financiers.

The following language of the Y.r I
"Courier 4: Enquirer in relation to the
connexion l>ct\veen the President and the
N. Y. Herald is strong, but not more so
perhaps than the circumstance war/ants.
"The truth is, the connexion between
the Executive and the paper alluded to, is
tfhe most humiliating and disgraceful occurrence

Ihistory of our government; an occurrence
that no respectable American citi^
jcen can think of, without pain, or hear alluded

it were not for the palpable proof, it would
be impossible for one brief moment to

personally or officially, could have so desecrated
his own character, and compromoted
the respectability of his sta*
tion."
Ten President and the X. Y. Herald.
The following extract from a letter to
tho Baltimore Patriot throws some light
* on the connection of the President with
this vile sheet.
. How long Mr. Webster will continue
in power, is not known, and cannot be
foreseen. He and the President are on
good terms. The President seems very
- I L . * * *
anxious to nave mm siay.
I fear, however. Mr. Webster cannot long
continue in office from the extraordinary
and malign influences about the President
just now, which laugh at the idea of his
staying in office, and threaten that in sixt
ty.days he shall go out. These influences
are novel and curious. The New York
Herald People here, to which Mr. Ewing
A. alludes, have captivated and bewitched
Mr. Tyler's family. There have been,
you may have remarked during the extra
s?>9sion, gatherings of ladies and gentlemen
in the President's Square, at the
Capitol, twice a week, to hear music, drc.
In the accounts the Herald has given of
these scenes, Mr. Tyler's two sons have

while the truly agreeable and interesting
daughter of the President has been held
up as a Princess?and she is one, they
who know her own, in her mild and lady
like deportment, and prudence and devo -
tion of character. The sons, however,
do not stand flattery so well, but have be.
"come perfectly charmed here with the per.
son that gives so interesting an account

ifo you how it is that the Herald, four days
. 'before the last veto message, had thp sup.

it. Thus, tf?o, " the veto message" was <
out in the Herald before it whs given to
Congress, which was certainly a high af.
front to the Cabinet, who never knew any I
thing of it till they bought it in the street. ]
These influences, that thus surround the
President, say Mr. Webster shall not stay,
while the President himself wishes him fo
continue. ' Let me not be undesfood as i
intending any attack upon the President
in all this, for I am sure he will correct
these evils, as report savs they exist, the

afford a firm security for the maintenance
of peace.
" Her iMajcsty is glad tobenble to inform
yon, that in consequence of theev.
acuation of Ghorian by the Persian troops,
Her Majesty has ordered Her Minister to
the Court of Persia to return to Teheran.
* Her Majesty regrets that the negociations
between Her Plenipotentiaries in '
i China and the Chinese Government have '
not yet been brought to a satisfactory
conclusion, and that it has been necessary 1
to call into action the forces which Her
Majesty has sent to the China seas; but (

I Her Majesty still trusts that the emperor
of China will see the justice of the de? '
mands which Her Majesty's Plenipoten.

that the differences which had arisen be. ,

Powers in 1835, for regulating the navigation
of the Douro, have been adjusted

CASE OF M'LEOD. di
In the House of Commons, on the oi
28th. August, Mr. Roebuck put several th
questions to Lord Palinerston, Secretary h<
r>f State for Foreign Affairs, as to what fa
liad passed between the British Govern. 9a
nient and the Government of .the United
States in relation to the case of Alcxan*
der McLeod; Whereupon > '
Lord Palmerston rose and said, he
should he the Inst mar in that house who ^
would interpose between, or who would
curtail any information which might .rb?. ^
given on any subject; but he at the same
rime felt bound to remark, that the procec*
dings of the Hon. member for Bath wer$ ^
somewhat irregular; because he was sure
the House would be ofopioiori/ifquestiotifrj ?
upon matters of the greatest difficulty and ^
delicacy were to be prefaced' by Hod. ^
members with a sort of narrative, it be. .
came extremely difficult for the individual ^
whose duty it might be to answer the
questions to refrain from going at length ^
into the subject to which those questions ^
related, and thus, under the form of asking
a question, a debate might be brought on ^
without notice upon a matter ofthegrea. V

However, he (Lord Palmerstonj should be

and he Lad no doubt the statement he was
about tq make would tend to relieve the

jpon the first demand made by Hef Ifajes- .

M'Leod an answer had been returned by ^
lie late Secretary of State of the United ca

with the principles upon which her

imild rend from those instructions would,

lestionf,-which had been put to him by
le hon. and learned member for Bath,
?r it would show that Her Majesty's Gjvnmont
had avowed its responsibility for
ieattack made upon the Caroline, and
ia{ the American Government treated
ie affair as one to be dealt with between
icitwo Governments and totally unconecied
with the question affecting Mr.

Tins instruction, v hich was dated the

i Mr. Crittenden, the Attorney.General

Mr. Webster then went on to say?
fhere is now. therefore, an authentic
iclnration on. that part of the British

and is recognized as such by the

I this declaration is not to be doubted,

mc tioned by the usages of all civilized
rtions, and which the Government of
le United States hns.no inclination to
spute. This.has no connexion what,
rer with the question whether in this
tse the attack on the Caroline was, as j
e british government think it, a justifiae
emplov ment of force for the purpose
defending the British territoryfrom un.
ovoked attack, or whether it was a most
ljustifiaBle invasion, in time peace, of the
rtricory of the United States as this
>Vernment has regarded it. The two
lestionsare essentially different, and,
hile acknowledging that an individual
# ' o u
ay caliji. immunity.from the consequen.
is of acts done by him, by showing that
' acted under . national authority, this

All that is intended to be said at present
that since the attack on the Caroline
avowed as a natioual act, which may

e government of the United States in
e judgmeut which it shall form ot the
insaction and of it* own duty should see
so to decide, yet it raises a question

lack upon the Caroline was unjustifia- :
i, as this government has asserted, the j
v jvhich has been violated is the law
nqtjons; and the redress which is to
sought is the redress authorized in such .
sea by the provisions of that code. Yon
s wejl aware that the President has no ,
mi.qal, courts of the state of New-York,

(he United States, I am directed to say
that the president upon the recept of Mr.
Fox's last communication would have immedintly
directed a nolle prosequi to be
entered." [Loud Cheers.] Now. nothing
could be more honorable to the Government
of the United States, or more satis
factory to that of this country, than this
declaration of principle. [Cheers.]
He thought he had now answered all
the questions put to him by the' hon. and
learned member for Bath except one?
namely, whether the United States had
made a demand upon this country for injuries
done to the United States at large i
and not for State of New-York especially.
Unquestionably the first demand had
made on that ground, and in the course
of the last session he Lord Palmerston
nad stated that fact as a ground for his opinion,
that impossible the United States could
turn round, and say it was a question between (
Great Britain and one State only. (Hear,?,
hear.) The constitution ot the United Slates J
placed all these matters in the hands of the j
Federal Government, and the tenth section |
of the first article 01 their Cohstitutio.i provi- 11
ded that?1"No State shall enter inte any
treatv. alliance or confederation, or grant let.
ters of marque and reprisal,' No St ate shall
without consent of Congress lay any duty of
tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time
of peace, enter into an argt eeinent or compact
with another State, or with a foreign
power, or engage in w-r, unless actually in.
vadcd, insucti an imminent as will not admit
the delay." (Hear, hear.) Therefore, it
was perfectly true that this que*tion"c<?uld no
more be said to be between Great Britain
and the State of New York than (if America
had felt herself aggrieved by Great Britain)
it could be said that the question was hertveen
America and the county of Rutland. [Hear.]
But the Hon. and learned member for Bath
had on a former evening suggested, that Her
Majesty's Government ought, on the outset of
this affair, to hare sent out a special envoy to
the authorities in the State of New York.
Now, he [Lord Palroerston] was of oDinion
that such a proceeding would have amounted
to a nullification or denial on the part of Great
Britain of the fundamental principles of the
constitution of the United States, and that
they would have treated it as an affront upou
the Federal Government. (Hear, hoar.)?
Therefore, it was not from neglect on the part
of Her Magesty'i Government that the course
had not been taken?on the contajrary, it had
been avoided out of the respect they
were bound to pay to the constitution of tlie
United States. (Hear, hear.) He (Lord
Palinerston) trusted he had now given an an-*
swer to the qucstionput to him. He should be
sorry to anticipatethecourse which the Govern
ment of the United States mignt think proper
to follow, in order to carry out the principles
of international law: and he thought the
object of the Hon. and learned gentleman
would be best answered if he (Lord Palmcrston
abstained from entering further into the
matter. (Cheers)
