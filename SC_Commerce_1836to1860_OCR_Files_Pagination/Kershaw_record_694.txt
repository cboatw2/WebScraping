difficulty she was removed from her bed J

which continued about two hours,
during which several successful expert-j

Mermaids.?As two gentleman of the
press, named Tom and Frank, were sauntering
among the rocks, they discovered
two beautiful mermaids sporting in the
witcr close to the beach. Delighted and
astonished at such a discovery, for a mo- j
ment they were at a loss what to do. Recovering,
however, from their first sur-'
prise, they retired behind a rock, where
they could see and not be seen by these;
divinities of the ocean. 4'Now Frank,out,
with your note-book, and write what I die- j
tate; my organs of perception are larger |
than yours. Are you ready?" "All ready,"
whispered Frank.* "Write lis cyi,

they were inXerupted by a stout elderly

in a rough voice, what he was j

A graceless scamp, says the Boston Bee,
was recently heard singing tlic following:
"When I can shoot my ritle clear,
To pigeons in the skies,
I'll bid farewell to pork and beans,

He was all alone by himself at the time

There is no reseniidance whatever hetwecr

allowed every member of a single branch of le
gislaturo, without reason, to repudiate any of iti

Equally unfounded is it to suppose (as ignor

the monarchs of France and England are no
absolute enough :o use the veto. They use i
every day; cue of them in the exclusive rigli
of initiating all legislation?and both of then

What has been passionately stigmatised as the
one man power in this country, is in ]>rinciplc
I he same tiling as the separation of Congress in.
io two bodies, to corrcctrfthc errors of earl
other; though much less powerful, because tin
power of a majority, by a single vo'c in citiie

is merely suspensive and subordinate. Jlad al

vote of the Speaker. There is much of oni

For the first time in the annals of the Unite
States, this immediate emanation of the Consti
tution is subjected, on the motion of an ex-I'resi
dent. fthe chairman of this Committee,) to tin
obstruction of the mere icchriicalliiies of legif
Jalion. 'J'Jic Constitution commands us to jour
ir:tl;/.e the President's objections, and then vol
on them. The House did .so on his prernonilo

ii::d we power to do so? Wore not the func
lions ol the House exhausted by the previou
proceedings! Can thev reircrate upon the E.\
eeutive a bill which he has returned, and ill
House cannot carry? ^ The undersigned feel
their duty to pretest against and resist it by th
only means left to a minority, preventive of th
unconstitutional acts of an angry majority, be
lieving that the time is near at hand when the
will themselves most regret, as all will condom
the innovation.
The succession of the acting President totfc
Chief Magistracy was unavoidably follow ed i)

of Iris own. Tirose whose political synipulhie

treated, with moderation; adhering, however, t
the faith of their own politics. Wo- noilhc
made nor gave the quarrel; but calmly and con

All the elections since, all'urd unquestionable
proof that, if there is any wrong in the Federa
Government, the constitutional means of. re

While thus abiding their time, the minoritie
of the two Houses of Congress abide by th
principle that the first Magistrate of-a great pet
%
pic is entitled to respect; and even by opponents
should be trcated'witli decorum. \Vc know on
3 dirtrencc in language and feeling towards the
. President and those which we use towards each
other in Congress. His not being personally
. present is, in our opinion, no reason for malig
ning his motives, traducing his character, or
I vilifying his administration. The most strenuous,
inflexible, and successful opposition con1
nists with the language arid spirit of moderation;
- and if the people arc the intelligent, sovereignty
. supposed by our institutions, would be more
. popular tlmn indignation, violence, and obloquy.

, I so large in both Houses voted, as to prove, be-1
Y; yond doubt, that it is extremely objectionable, i
.J and which we, in common with every one of'
,Mhorc large numbers, representing, as we have
11 every reason to believe, the wishes of a large
i; majority of the American people, conscientious- J
J lydeotu unwise, unjust, and as many think, un-,
.'constitutional. The President's objections arc
. j contained in a respectful message, temperate ,
jI in tone, persuasive in argument, and develop-:
3! Ing topics which wc believe will meet with popu-!
jj lar acceptance. On the several messages of j
31 the same hind, drawn from Mr. Tyler by this'
t j Congress, candor and history will acknowledge, I
. | we think, that the last is the best, in all the
j merits of reason, diction and temper. The
. Constitution gives him the right which his con- j
. [science enjoins him to exercise. Allowing the
. j Chief Magistrate, therefore, what every Presi-'
_! dent is entitled to, and has enjoyed on such oc-J
i jensions?simply to speak and act for himself?j
jjtlie next step, according to the Constitution and.
i [ uniform practice, should have been forthwith to ,
.' take the votes of the House of Representatives,,
j which would undoubtedly have shown that the :
.'President is sustained by very nearly, if not
.1 quite a majority. I
t| The undersigned regret the novel and (as!
I many conceive) unconstitutional innovation to
t! which the President's objections are subjected? |
t not for his account, but that of constitutional libi
erty and congressional propriety. We believe
. that he is perfectly right in insisting that the
: public lands shall not be withdrawn from the as,
sets of the Federal Government, when, with all
ll.n nlnnnnlc nf r/i^nnrco n ?ul n hll nfl.l tiff nrofleT
) ing tlieir relief to Congress, it persists in rcdu3
cing and degrading the country, for 1 he first time,
r to tiie extremities offinancial want and pecuniary
3 distress. We think that, under such circum|;
stances, to withhold the magnificent real estate
d of this Union from public mortgage, is an act of
r madness and suicide difficult to conceive of hur
man passions. We have not a doubt that nine3
tenths of the people ofthc United States strongly
disapprove of it, and that a majority of those rnis1
represented by majorities in Congress, whatever
. the;r impression might he as to the proper dispo1
sition of the puidic lands under ordinary circutn.

H legislation and orderly Government. Armies
. and navies unpaid for months; dismantled, not
. for want of revenue, hot through party passion;
1 Congress without their own favorite compensai5'
lion, putting fetters and vetoes on all the opcra!1
tions of Government, betray a spirit of pctulent
3 ' self-denial, the counterfeit of self-government,

I mcnt; arousing ruthless, revolutionary counterfaction,
if the people are not wiser than some of
it their Representatives. Party, an element and
!. help of patriotism, may be prostituted to anarchij_
cal dissension. The undersigned trust that re<5
volutioiiarv views are not common in Congress,
s as we feefsure that tlfey are not acceptable to
n the people.
>_ | It is not for this protest to explain or enforce
s the Executive objections. Letting them speak
. for themselves, we vindicate constitutional rights,
and deprecate wrongs by Congress. Without
d objecting to any censure or measures deemed
. proper by the frustrated majority?and appeal to
j. the peojde?we should spare them this protest,
!_ but for the character, temper and tendency of the
f. counteraction inflicted?not so hurtfully on the
d Chief Magistrate, as on republican institutions.
i_ The present proceedings, with all its angry antcj.
cedents and violent results, is without example,
c : without warrant, and of evil tendency.
1 The deplorable condition of the treasury of the
United States is notorious; not only without mone
ey, hut, as has been said, without law for raising
- , it. The President's exposure of this penury is
r. humiliating truth, which unrelenting opposition
wrings from him, to justify the repeated miss
called vetoes, also #rung from him by the same
pertinacious opposition. A complicated scheme
e ' of (in many particulars) high-pressure impost,
it; calculated to revive appeased dissention, and
e perpetuate unpleasant discontent, forced through
e j Congress by inexorable legislation, carried by a
!- ;.floajority of one vote if all had been present?of
y | but four as it was?is returned by the President
n | with objections, for reconsideration. The House
| of Representatives, which ought to be thankful
e for the opportunity of it, turns upon him with iny
dignant denunciation; he is threatened, and only
threatened, with impeachment; and by false anlf
j alogy to the memorable affair of English shipd
j money, is told, contrary to the genius and the
s i letler'of our mild laws, that his head ought to be
i- j brought to the block. Discord is proclaimed as
y j the order of the day. Conciliation is said to be
0, disgraceful, and concession out of the question,
r The undersigned flatter themselves that these
- arc but hasty ebullitions through the safetys
valves of-free government. When appeaJ to
n battle is menaced, wc cannot believe that the
>1 battle of bloodshed or civil war is contemplated,
d but presume nothing worse than conflict by the
e ballot-bggj/lot the cartridge-box. The columns
- of this ca'pital and of the public press, albums,
ii magazines, and various other repositories of the
- ardent temperament which betrays itself in such
1. appeals, may excuse the suggestion that possibly
r> tiu'v am intended neither for the cartridee-box
I nor the ballot-box, but merely for the band-box.
- During the nearly twelve months of irksome and,
- inglorious session of this Congress, to the great
B annoyance of the community, appeals to passion
e have been much more common than to reason.
) By the eminent mover of this Committee, none
of the great subjects of deliberation have hardly
been spoken of?banks, exchequer, finance,
bankruptcy, tariff? upon any and all of which his
wisdom and experience might have afforded edifying
discourses; w'hile all the minor topics of
personal, party, and especially presidential exasperation,
have never failed to be vexed with implacable
and indefatigable agitation.
It has been said, in the course of indignant harangues,
that there is not only no money, but no
law to raise it; and that the. Chief
like a profligate King of Great Britain, cndjjjktj
-'it!.-..,, I-.,,. T?-.r>\r ivivli did. nerSKpZ
beget mistaken impression to that effect, to which
mere professional opinion gave color. But mature
consideration, and the true philosophy of interpretation,
satisfy the .undersigned, and they believe
the most distinguished jurists of the country,
that it is unfounded apprehension to think
that Congress ever could have intended, b^. an
act or omission, to leave the Government without
aliment for its subsistence. The important
question will be settled by the Supreme Court
of the United Slates, in whom the undersigned,
with the great body of llie American people,
without distinction of party, repose confidence.
The aspersion of that tribunal, inferred from
English history, ir not only unjust disparagement,
but inaccurate historical recollection ?
Even the twelve judges of Engla .d never did,
as has been said, unworthily submit to royal dictation;
but many of tlietn (although their tenure
of office, salaries, and perhaps lives, depended
on the King's pleasure) manifestly resisted his
rapacious will. In the United States, the public
money?whfch the President is laudably anxious
to raise by law, through the ordinary means?
could not be employed in his profligate indulgences,
in war or other offensive application; and
wc trust that the Judges of the Supreme Court
of the United States, in no way dependent on the
Executive, whenever th^y come to the solemn
adjudication of this vital question, will deal with
it as they did at their late session with another,
which, probably, provoked the unjust imputation
on their rectitude?treating this question of impost,
as they did that of slavery, with integrity
and independence. Th? undersigned hope thev
will come to the conclusion, which all lovers ol
'their country must desire, that, instead of deserving
capital punishment, the President is entitled
to the thanks of dispassionate men foi
anxiously enforcing the law concerning imports
Nor will we emit this occasion, while vindicating
that court, for expres^yjg grateful acknowl
edgemcnts to it for having^ contrary to manj
pre-possessions, by independent judgment; sus
tained the most delicate provisions of our Unioi
against the clamors and prejudices of negrophilism.
Finally, the Undersigned are assured, thai
whatever the court does, they will not leave (as
has been strangely imagined they must) the de
termination of this great question of law to tin
' arbitraments of juries. Thcrc'is hardly a juro:
1 in the^ountry who docs not know that property
liberty, and order; are best preserved by main
taimng that .venerable jurisprudence which it
civil cases, leaves to juries onlyquestions of fact
and refers to judges questions of law. The un
dersigned have no fear of the judiciary. The
dread no veto or dictation from a President.?
They are not alarmed by crises of party. American
republican annals are a continued series o
formidable conjunctures, without detriment t<
the republic?antagonism without commotionState
and individual conflicts without civil war
or any unwholesome catastrophe. The charita
hie ballot-box is always at hand, with incsliina
hie relief, to vent all passions. V'/c arc liapp;
to find that a portentous committee?the otTsprinj
oi uiuiguaiiou?prupuses jio liuui aci, uul u,
proceedings will go out in harmless explosion
Eloquent invective, angry denunciation, piiilip
pics of speech and print, inflict 110 fatal blows 01
the solid bulwarks of this great empire, whicl
advance steadily in greatness, increasing in popu
lation, production, and power, rejoicing in peaci
and plenty, while antagonist parties and arnbi
tious individuals struggle for its honors with 1
fierce but harmless recrimination. Republican
Government would else be bereft of its rationa
attractions and manly support?the noble ex
citements of a free press, free speech and uni
versal suffrage; admirable substitutes for tin
stagnant tranquility, frivolous recreations, am
dreadful energy of despotism. Let the battle
I mcnt8 of this Capitol continue to rock with salu
! tary agitation. Our reliance is in the inajestii
: strength and serenity of a sovereign pcopie.
The undersigned cannot believe that Con
' gross will adjourn wihout enacting a law for re
venue. They will not afford the President si
great a triumph. The public distemper is si
great a triumph. The public distemper is si
easily remediable, that those in power never cai
answer to the community for longer failing t
i apply the remedy. The minority is not respon
sible. nor the President, nor even the Senate.?
The House of Representatives is exclusive);
the national purse-bearer. By the majority o
that House should be annually replenished ant
! arranged its receipts and issues, as the report o
the majority of this committee argues. Most o
, the troubles experienced by the present and pen
j ultimate administrations, including the over
throw of the latter, are attributable to supcrer
1 ogatory Executve efforts beyond Executive duty
I to repair disordered finances?disordered by ill
'judged and calamitous acts of Congress. Tin
1 people will hold the majority of the House o
Representatives responsible for this their appro
! priate and chief office. It is disreputable to then
that restoration so easy has been long deferred
No country in the world has such resources am
facilities for revenue. One year's administra
tion of stlch laws as Congress shoul enact woulc
draw from the inexhaustablc means, the labor
the ingenuity, the commerce, the manufactures
and the public lands of the United States, super
abundant income. But, as with the fatal distribution
of surplus revenue among the States
distress and demoraliza'ion began, so are the}
continued by the same egregious impolicy; insisting
on alms?giving a pittance of land sale:to
the States. The undersigried discern, will
deep disapproval, that the report of the majority
of this committee, in conformity with the vote?
of its chairman, strenously argues distribution ol
the public lands to pay the debts of the Stales,
This is not the occasion to develope the dangers
of that much-condemned scheme. In preference
/or another, and much belter, nearly all Congress
coincide in opinSjbr with the President and
ilie people, viz:?that immediate relief would
proceed from a moderate, discriminating, permanent
tariff Why is it not a law? Why may i(
nr>?. be made at rtrifee! WIjo binders ill Is party
passion to prevail, or magnanimous patriotism?
The imdecsigned will'not doubt, even tliuugh
perhaps doomed to disappointment.
This mortal issue, ii' cast by Congress upon
an injured, insulted, oppressed, and otifrajjed
people, may return, with dread responsibility*, J
with deep damnation, to plague the inventors of _
such misciiief. Those we act with are ready to
sro forth, and be tried by the country, in full con^^jSy
fidence of popular justice. Others wi
f mine fur themselves, and for us^po, as we are ' VH
if but a minority.* The report of tire majority pro^>0
sen nothing but that the President be assailed, .J
jand ihfl*vousutntio:i be assaulted; the President
! impeached without trial, the country dishonored .
ikJiim for exercising, almost under CongresSioh-.
durcssc, an unquestionable and much-cherish^ ,
en power, dear to a noble people, which it is tha
wildest dream of excited party to suppose that
people will ever suffer to bs stricken from the
Constitution. Mean time, what is tb be done.'
Arc Congress to call out moia vetoes? Like *7
barbarous nations, worshippm*^moniac crea- ?
lures of their own malignant roagin^g, are we
all to be sacrificed to the evil Discord
and Despair? Are distraction "bnd* inaption th
minister furious and dreadf^lreflifftfe? The un-.
der3igncd rely on popular providence, which, in' 4
several trials, has with the smiles of IIe"aven?
overruled whatever perils have beset our (till ,
now) thougli^H&nd considerate country. No4'
God of hattieSr^hvoked for our rescue. Depreeating
such shocking profanation, humbly
trust that no battle or bloodshed, no oml war or 1
massacre, is the only umpirage to determine for
rational freemen the simple question whether '
they will support or repudiate the Government
of their own creation.. JVe do not despair. We

r law, and exposition of the Treasury as 6tatcd in
- the President's message at the commencement
i of the present session, he continues: '
The revenue bill was reported on the 3d of
t Juno, and taken up for the first time in commiti
tec of the whole on the 8th of June. Thi final
. reduction of duties to twenty per cent under
; the compromise of 1833, was to take"effect on
r the 30th of June, and then the the distribution
, under the act of 1841 was to commence, provi
ded the duties were not raised beyond twenty ?
i RSLfCnt. On the 7th of June the -committee
i of ways and means, which had reported the re-^Sf
^ venue bill on the 3d,. brought in what'was called
y a provisional bill, the ostensible object of which
- was to provide for a temporary collection of du- *
. ties until time could be afforded for the jSassage
f of the general revenue bill. The revenue bill
j provided for a general increase of dutie&jjbeyond
- ; twenty per cent, and its passage would ireces,
'sarily have enforced the suspending clause of
- j the distribution act The provision bill report-jedon
the 7th of Juno, contained no reference
y to this suspending clause of the distribution act
j j On the 9th of June a second provisional bill was
s j reported from the committee of ways and means,
i. i with the same general objects as the first, which
-Ihad been reported only two days before, and
i with a proviso repealing the suspending clause
i of the distribution act.
The first provisional bill was never consider3
od. The second was passed by the House on
- the 15th of June, went to the Senate, returnedj^
l with amendments which were, concurred in th?S^
i 25th of June, and was returned by tbe Presi-^*
l'dent with objections on the 29th of June.?
- These objections were founded on the deplora^
-1 b!e condition of the Treasury, and on the expes
jdiency of adhering under the circumstances to
dthe terms on which distribution had been au-!
ihorizcd by the act of 1841vThe revenue bill did ^
-! not pass until tbe 5th of August. It was returnfHf
c ed with the President's objections on the 9th.
These objections are now before the committee.
They are substantially the same as those
which accompanied the provisional bill on the
0 29ih of June. The revenue bill contained a
j clause most unequivocally repealing the sus0
pension of the distribution act, which its own
rj passage would have enforced, and thus it was in
0 effect the enactment of a new distribution law,
applied to the revenue bill.
Kacli house ueliberateJJ&ftised to strike out
y this and persisted in assocrating in ludtertrous^
f contrast two measures, the one an act to raise
1 money for the support of government by the imf
nositionof taxes, the other to distribute the land *
f revenues among the States. The majority of
- both Houses had proclaimed, with the concur
rcnce of the Presiden!, in September, i84l,
- that distribution should only be made when the
, duties were below twenty per cent. The ma
jority of both Houses had again and again pro3
claimed, in 1-842, the necessity of raising the
f duties above twenty per centi' and yet tbey in
sisted on distributing the land fund without re-i
) gard to the situation of tho^Frcasury, and without
regard to the burthens which might be im1
posed en the people.
They might have attempted to raise revepue
1 from imports and to distribute the land fun<k?in
, seperate bills. Then each measure would have
, rested on its owu intrinsic 'merits. But they

, designed to guard against increasing the burr
tiiens of taxation to fill avacootn occasioned by
. distribution. The legislation of 1842 is designi
ed to create a vacuum, filled by increased..,taxai
tion. There is no precedent in this histoty of
any government, for the union, under rinc^ciri
cumstances, of a revenue and an appropriation
