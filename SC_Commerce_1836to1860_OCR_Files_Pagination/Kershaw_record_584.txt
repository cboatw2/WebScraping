Protecting Labor.?A number ol
ultra tariffites, recently assembled in New
York for the"purpose of forming a "Horm
, League," for the avowed purpose of "pro
, tccting" labor through a protective tariff
Now, we would not be atraid to wager ?
, tritle that this whole body did not contain
, one laborer, nor a man who doC6 not em
, ploy laborers at the lowest possible rate
But how do they propose to protect labori
[ Simply by raising the price of cloth ant
J other articles of universal consumplior
, some forty per cent, above their receni
rates! Will they raise wages so much:
. Not it. All experience gives the lie to the
, pretence. We recollect an admirable il
lustration of this labor protecting opera'
( lion. Oive of the largest manufacturing
, establishments in New York had a slon
connected with their works, at which the
laborers were obliged to trade, and w<
know for a fact that these laborers paii
twenty-five cents per yard for cotton cloth
which was retailed in the village stores foi
twelve and a half cents!
But let us look at this matter in the liglu
furnished by countries who have long en
joyed the protection of a high tariff?
England is such a country. Have hei
high impositions of duty on grain protect
ed the field laborer?' If they have, we are
at a loss to know where to find the evi
dence of i.l certainly not in the wages af
forded urrder the protecting principles.?
I The same is true of the laborers in hei
i manufactories. These have been "protect
ed until they, as a mass, are reduced almosl
[ to destitution. The protection of laboi
, is not the real object, but, if it were, the
scheme for accomplishing it is impractica'

interests of labor by increasing its re

C EXTRAORDINARY DISCLOSOREs!
ie When the celebrated Doling, alias Smitf
was discovered to be playing the gay Lothario,
on a rather extensive scale, it was
it rumoured that he was only one of a g-a/ig-,
ir who had leagued together for speculating
e- on an entirely new plan. Bank robii
beries, defalcations, fruuds, forgeries,
s,, were becoming too common, and die |Vro
n fits of these professions were dwindling
d on account of competition. But as lite
r- inventive genius of man is never at a loss,
e a new and quite extraordinary' method has
r-' been adopted to raise the wind, one bold
1, as it is infamous, and fraught with the
is most direful consequences to the happiajness
of the domestic circle, and with
e..shame, misery, and degradation to the
r fairest, the gentlest portion of creation. It
I. was rumored that there was a regular band
L. of ruffians, organized for the purpose of
s deceiving and . marrying innocent and
n simple young girls, and then, after grati>f
(ying their beastly and .unholy passions,
e and (reducing innocence and virtue to ir[,
reparable ruin, to make off to 'unknown
it parts' with the estates of those whom
t their wicked arts had deluded. This was
L- I 1K0 r'nmnr and nnnthfir pxtmnrdinarv case
it of bigamy which baa jnst come to onr
- knowledge seems to confirm the report,?
a Many of our readers will recollect that
a they were visited a short lime since by a
p Mr, Wellington, who came with a long
e string- of recommendations from Judges,
- Senators and dignitaries of various classes,
I to iusiruct in the mysteries of. writing,
s and who, after levying a heavy cootribur
lion on their purses, and teaching them'
) to make a few flourishes with the pen,
t left, as he said, to exercise his art in otht
er regions. Now, we liave.just heard that
' this Mr. Wellington had a young wife in
i Warrenton whom he had brought from
i Philadelphia. A short time since this
- lady was visited by another Mrs. Welling-"
i ton, from Richmond, Va., who having
t heard rumors of her husband having
another wife, came to investigate the fact,
i Her worst fears were confirmed by finding
another viction of the accomplished scoundrel.
Officers are now on the track of the
villian and soon no doubt will lay him by
f- the heels, This report \ve havejust heard,

; "Captain T. and his crew, however,

I that although immediately after they were

respecting it transpired. A few days after,
however, the Poatuguese Governor of a
L small post in the; island applied .to the
Amereican Captain for aid in reading a
letter which he haff received from the English
commander, which proved to be an
account of the action. The Governor had
not been able to understand the letter,;
which had probably been written to give
him official intelligence of the proximity
of such a powerful force. It will be recollected
that a slaver carried'into St. He

'1 here were several cases of interest and
i importance, both on the civil and stute
Z dockets. On the latter there was one of a
r capital nature, the enormity of tfhich, together
with the sex of the criminal, excited
a deep and awful sensationin the breast
I ofihe community: it was the case of the
State vs. Katharine Hill, indicted for the
e murder of Henry Hill, jr.
51 It appeared, from thoevidence adduced,
- th.nt. sometime during the present month,
2. the deceased, a youthof seventeen or eigli
teen yenrs; rn company with a younger
,! brother, hnd gone to the house of the hus-;
e band of the prisoner, (Henry Hill, sr.,'
s their cousin) that there, under the excitement
of strong drink, a charge was made
e by Henry Hill,' sr., against Henry," jr? of
s having stolen a blanket, which they had
0 been using in gathering peas, that the
t charge was returned with spirit, whereupi,
on the deceased received a blow, fled, was
s was pursued and slabbed by bis cousin,
i- Henry Hill, sr.?that the prisoner also
if pursued the deceased, and, by'order ofher
n husband, inflicted heavy bimvs upon liim
e with a rail and a board, of all which he
r- died in a few days.

; It may be, and we wish we could believer
it-, that her demeanor on the occasion rc-j

i "there is a stupefaction in wo. and tha?
the heart sinks without a pang when

have been, that the.fellings of the'poor

tender sensibilities common to woman, had
been strained to such a degree as to havil
Inst their elasticity; and that the nertresj
I bad been so unsvruug by extreme suffering:,
that they were unable to indicate to "the *
world the emotions that heaved and agila-'
