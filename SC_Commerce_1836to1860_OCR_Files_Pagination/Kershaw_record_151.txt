THE subscriber ititoruis the public, that he has
just completed the mixture of this valuable medicine.
He takes pleasure in stating that he has
i. si.:, n A AT A nn A *
uiiuTv iibo ui iiiia successituiy in n caw
of Scrofula, which ho has been afflicted with more
than tiiri:k years. On several occasions ho applied
to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
and received no benefit. He was, at length, prevailed
upon by numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtue of certain ROOTS and HERBS; and believing,
that tho Receipt would greatly benofit him.
he took it, together with an old French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper hero to sav^ that the auality of some,
or all the principal Roots, are well known to the
Medical Faculty, by whom they are frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil Ulcerated Sores,
Kneral diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
ercury ; it has a decided salutary effect.
For Bowel Complaint he would also recommend
the use of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Children
are frequently attacked wi'n this complaint:
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PAN
AUKA win check the ttowcls, an J they become regular
again. It has been tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
cure." He has tried it at different times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
This Medicine is simple in its operations j and ha*
a pleasant taste.
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The sulwcriber will Keep a constant supply of the
Panacea at the different Drug Stores throughout
the United States. Orders addressed to the sulwcriber,
or to James R. M'Kain, will he promptly attended
to- The PANACEA may always be had at
J. R. M'Kaiu's Druo Store, Caindon, S. C.
Price one dollar per bottle.

The Vegetable Elixir.
prepared by
p. s. BRONsorr.
IT Is with great pleasure the subscriber informs
the public that iiC has completed the mixture ol
the VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine Is
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It in
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
known that all Roots have valuoble Medical properties.
He would also state that therejs not the
least danger tu the use ot the Klixir. For the following
named diseases there is no medicine made or
vended at the present time, hetier calculated to relieve
the afflicted, than the Veqetadlk Elixir.
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Emxk<
should be used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dysury, he would also recommend
the use ot the F.lixi'r, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
To those who arc articled with Pustules, Eruptive
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, he particularly
recommends the use of the VEGETABLE ELIXIR.
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as the dest now in use?as it has proved
successful in every case in which it has been used.
Orders addressed to the subscriber or Mr. J. R.
M'Kain, will be promptly attended to. The Elixir
may always be had at J. R. M'Kain's Drug Store,

PATENT COTTON ?S1N.
THIS Gin can be made double, or single. If
made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
louble, the quantity of cotton over the single cy linler
Gin, ho other knd having been in use prevous
o this patent*, and whether single or double, they
ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
nore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 160 saws in a stand, and whether
imall or large, one hand Will be sufficient to attend
hem. Tne Gins have mechanical feeders and
toppers attached to them, which free the cotton
rom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
taws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
eceives from the feeders, which make two revoutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
jined state, before it descends to the saw By a
rery simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
faates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
vhidh the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
nade to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of I
he cotton at the time. When made double, the
aws are Dlaced on two sets of t*w1lnrb>ro ?b<i I
-J ---- ? ? wuu ?Ut?J
ipon each other in opposite dirfectiohs, and are
leansed by two sets of brushes that have four revo
ntions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
e detached so as to enable the planter to run one
rboth at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
lectin one stand. The whole Is put in operation
vith a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
nay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power,
t mav also be propelled by iron running gear.
The force required to work it, is about the same as
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in
he common Gin. This Gin has been put in
peration in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
md its success tested ih the presence of a large
lumber of planters, merchants and others, and
eceived their general approbation
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give
he Patentee their written opinion respecting the
nerits of the Gin. A number of others could be
idded, but the following are deemed sufficient:
from bis Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Orleans, Feb. 27.1H37.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
vhatl think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have

Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the

that ever came under my observation. It is completely

in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton

I regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brash*

| at most. Some wish saw* with 8 or 9 teeth to tho
inch, while others wont 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and the mariufaetorerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
plan An order can be executed, from the time it
is received, in the space uf eight or nine weeks,
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of fho
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hand* of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
