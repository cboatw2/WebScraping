President's Message.
FeUov Citizens of the Senate,
and House of Representatives.
I congratulate you on the favorable cir
cumstances in the condition of our cou noy.
tinder which you reassemble fur the per
formasee of your official duties. Though
the anticipa.tont of an abundant harvest
have not every where been realized, yet,
on tho whole the labors of the husband
.nan are rewarded with a bountiful return;
industry prospers in its various channel.,
of busluess and 6iterprise; general health
again prevails through our vast diversity
of 6limate; nothing threatens, Irun abroad,
the contibanace of externai peace; nor has
any th.ng at hone impaired the vrengh
of those fiaternal and domestic ties which
coeastitue the-only guaranty to the success
and permanency of our happy Union, and
which, formed in the hour of peril, have
hitherto been honoribly sustaited through
every vicissitude in or national afluirs.
These blessings, w4hich eince the care
and beneficience of Providence.cauli for our
devout and fervent gratitude.
We have not-le-s reason to be grateful
for other bounties bestowed by the same
anunificent hand, and more exclusively
Qur own.

The Constitution devised bky our forela

which it was fiunded, hut wonderfully pro

Though subject to change and entire re%o
cation, whenever deenmed intdequate tu
all these purposes, yet such is the wisdomt,
of its construction, and so statle has been
the public sentiuent, that at remnail-i unal
tered except.in atters of detail, compara
tively unimportant. it has proved amply
sufficient for. the various emergencies in
ident to our conuition as a nattion. A
formidable foreign war; agitating collibions
between domestic and, in amne respects,
rival sovereignties; temnptattons to itterfere
in the intestine cominotions of neighbur
ing countries; the dangerous influences
that arise in periods of ex-essive prosneri
ty; and the anti-republican tendencies of
associated wea th-these, with other trials
not less formidable, have all been eneun
teted, and thus fLr successfully resisted.
-It was reserved ior the Amnericau Union
to test the advantages of a Governmne t
entirely dieudent on the conttnual exer
cise of the potular wil.; and otr experience
has shown itat is is as henefictent ii prc

has contributed to extend the right of suf-.
frago, has increasedl tne direct intduencee of
the smass of the community, given greater
freedom to individual exertion, andf re
stricted, more amnd more, thte powers of
government; yet the ittelligentce, prun

kept pace with thiw augimented responsi
uility. Ila'nn country has education been
so widely diffused. Dotnestic peace has
no where so largely reigned. Ti'oa close

every where respected, becase they are
knos,n to be guarded by a united, sensi

To this practical operation of our insti

that increased attachinent to them which
is amosig the most cheerl*ul exhibilious of

Titis review of the results of our inslitu
tions, for hall a century, without exciting
a spirat ot vaim exultation, should serve to
itipress upou us ijie grt at principles rom
-*hich they have sprung; conistvnt and di.

part of the Government from exercising
any douetaul or dispuied powers; and a
cautious abstineoce from all intoerfrence
with concerns winch properly belong, and
are best left to State regulations and indi

in othe Pects, deserve the careful con.
siderati f Congress.
I re to state that the blockade of the
principa .krie on the eastern coast of Mex.
:co, whic i in consequence of differences
between that Republic and France, was
institutedin May last, unfortunutely still
continues, enforced by a competen French
naval forpe, and is necessarilly embarras
sing to oir own trade in the gulf, in com
mion wito, that of other nations. Every
dispositica, however, is believed to exist.
on the p" of the French Government, to
render tIl measure as little onerous as
practicable to the interests of the citizens
ofthe United States, and to those of neu
tral commaerce; and it is to le hoped that
an early settlement of the difculties be
tiween France and Mexico, will soon re
establish '4he harmonious relations former
ly subsisting between them,and again open
the pot ts.of that Republic to the vessels of
all friendly nations.
A conv.ntiou for marking that part of I
tihe boundry between the United Staites
and the Nppublic of Texas, which extends
from the fnouth of the Sahine to Red Ri i
ver, was.oncluded and signed at this city
on the 26th of April last. It has since I
been ratiied by both Governments; and i
,easo anie measures will be taken to carry I
it into efWet on the pan of the U. States.
The aplication of that Republic fur
ad4missiotInto this Union, made iii August,
1837, aniwhich was declined for reatons
already W-ade known to you, has been for
msally-wlhdrawi, as will appear from the I

cultivate those sentiment-, of nutual res
pect and good will which experience has
proved so heneficinl in iternational inter
course, the Government of the United
States has deemed it expedient, from time
to iim?. to establish diploimatic coniections
with diffierent forei.n States, by tihe alp
pointiment ofrepresentatives to reside with
in their respective territories. I am grati
fied to be enabled to announce to you that
since the close ofthe last session, these re

Sicilies; that new nominations have been
made in the respective missions of Russia.

Confederation.
An exposition of the fiscal nlffirs of the
Government. ani- of their condition for the
past year. will lie made to you by the
Secretary tif the Treasury.
The available balnuce in the Treasury.
on the lqt of Januarv next, is e.imated it
$2,765,342. The ~receipts of the year
from eustotms and lands, will probablly a
motutt to $20.615-598$ These usual sour
ces of revenue have beet) increased by an
issue of Treasury notes-of which less
thatn eight millions of d(llors, including ini
teresitlmand principal, will lie outstanding at
the end of the vear-andI by thme sale of one
of the bonds of thme Batik of the United
Stages, for 82,2-54,d71 The aggregate
of meaens fromn these and other sources,
with the balance on the first of January
last, has been applied "I' the payment of
ap)prop)riatnns by Conigress. The whole
expenditure for the year on their accouti',
including the redemption of more fthan
eight millionsof Trreasutry notes, constitu
tes an aggregateof about forty millions oaf
dollars, and will still leave in the Treasury
the hallance before stated,
Nearly eight millions of dollars of Treas
ttry notes are to be panid dturing the coining
year, in addition to the ordinmaryaprr
ations for the support of G~ovemnt. For
both these purposes, the resourees of the
Treasury will undoi.btedlv be suiffiiet, if
thme charges upon it are m'ot increased be
yond the annual estimaates. No excess,
however, is likely to exist, nor can thme post
potted instalment of the airplus revenue be
. deposited with the States. nor any consid
, erable appropriations hevonmd the estimia
j tes be madea; without cauasing a delicientcy
sin the Treasury. The great caution, ad
e visable at all times, of limiting appropria
,tions to the wants of the public service, is
a rendered necessary at present by the pros
,pective and rapid reduction of the tariff;
while the vigilant jealousy, evidently exci
e ted among the people by the occurtences
,of the last few years, assures us thtat they
a expect from their representasives. and will
sustain them in the exercise or, the most ri
gid economy. Much can be effected by I
postponing appropriations not immnediately
required ror tihe ordinary public service,
or for any pressing emergency; and much
by reducing the expenditures where tihe en
fire and immediate accomplishment of the
Objects in view is not indispensable. I
When we call to mind the recent and
extreme embarrassnteus produced by ex
cessive issues of bank paper, aggravated
by tie unforeseen withdrawal of much lo- I
reign capital; and the inevitaole derange- t
lent arising fromn tie distribution of the t
surplus revenue among the States as re- t
quired by Congress; and consider the
heavy expenses incurred by the removal of C
Indian tribes; by the nililary operations in li
Florida; and on account (if tie unusually i
large appropriations nmade at the last two Y
aninualsessions of Congress for other ob 11
lects, we have striking evidenice. in the pre- it
ienit -tficient state of our finances, of the i
abundant resources of the country to itilil
lif its obligations. Nor is it less gratifyin:g i
o find that the general nusimess of the tt
oitimmunity, deeply atlected as it has been, 4
a reviving % ith additional vigor, chastened i
>y the lessons of the past; and animated by n

A change in the office of collector at -
