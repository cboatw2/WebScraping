About to bid adieu to the enre* and ??-;

you for the last time, to anile with yon in 1
deliberations fur promoting the welfare of
South Carolina, I am incapable of expressing
the gratification f experience in '
contemplating the spectacle of onexam- J
pled prosperity, which now crowns the
hopes and blesses the labor* of all classes ,
of our Fellcw-Cttizens.
At no for ner period, have tbey enjoyed
such pecuniary means of fulfilling their 1
destiniesas a community of enlightened 4
freemen, and of discharging tho oblige- 1
tions, wfiieh they owe to the world end to

> which are visible in all directions, and not |
least conspicuous at the centre of onr Pe- '
deral Empire.
It belongs appropriately to you Pellow
CStlahti, as the Legislators of 8?uU?
Carolina, ane the selected guardians ??f her
wclfareiio eonntarneu by in the means la
your power, these fearful and downward
tendencies, and to give seeti a wiee and
salutary direction to the moral. wteiectu-j
nl and physical energies of the people, as I
-xrill expand every aelftfc feeling into patriotifm,
and impress it upon the mimj of
cvery eitbtrn, that his first and greatest
interest is the gcnrral prosperity of the
State, and the security of her institutions,
her rights and her liberties.
TVDili Id up theaolid fabric of the pros*
parity of a Stale, bv developing the elements
?f her wealth and power, and organising
systems of public ins'ruction, calenisled
to elevate the standard of popular
morals, sod popular intelligence, is the
noblest employment that can excite the
ambition or task the faculties of legists*
tort Mid staltsmen. ^ In comparison with
this, the miserable schemes of petty snd
fi?!iich ambition, scrambling lor otucc
through oil the filthy mazes of intrigue
and corruption, sink into contempt and
ii?il|nlficance. South Carolina baa achieved
an enviable reputatation by her noble
and successful struggle for the essential
interests and constitutional rights of the
Southern Stales. ReT success in that uneooa!
contest, and the high character with
which she came out of It, were principal'
W owing to the apprrent and acknowledged
ra>t- Aat her Statesmen and her nennie
wcw actuated exclusively by a patriotic
spirit of resistance, directed against a
??stera of rnrcn^rtlnttona! oppression,
without any ulterior purpose of selfishI
ambition. Let us cherish and preserve
the reputation we hare thus nobly acquired,
a- the Romans did their vestal fire.?
Let no statesman of South Carolina, tarnish
her glorious escutcheon, by enlisting
as a partizan under the banner of any of
those political chiefs trho are grasping at
the Presidential Sceptre. The political
principles and peculiar institutions of the
State may be sold and sacrificed, but most
assuredly they can nercr be preserved by
such degrading partisanship. South Carolina,
and all the States haying similar
institutions, "must not put their trust in Pro-'1
sidents," but look to their own power and j i
principles, for the security of their rights and !
instituti ins. Tbey are in a'permanent mi* i
nority on all questions affecting lh. se rights
and institution*, and whoever may exercise
the powera'pf the chief magistracy, they wilt i
be exercised in obedience to the will of tbe >
adrerse majority. So long as this state of $
thingsshall!continue; so long as theexrco-.i
tire government of tbe United States shall t
be conducted by an administration holding <
principles incompatible with tbe full security.
of our institutions and rights; no ratcsmao j
of rtooth (Carolina tan become associated i
with that administration, without justly in- <
curnng the imputation of becoming an ae- i
complice in overthrowing he essential guar* "
antces of her vital interest* tie cannot i
worship the sun of federal power, end offer <
up the homage of a de voted heart oa the al- <
tars of the >latc. !
If the politicians of all the planting
States would act upon their ohriousprin-i
ciples, our rights and institutions would <
bo speedily placed upon a foundation !
which uothing could shake in future.? t
The whole of those Slates would be uoi- f
fed upon principles essential to their very 1
existence, and standing upon tboramparts';'
of the Constitution, in defence ol their 1
sacred rights, would present a phalanx t
which no assailing power could overcome, f
OuU however other States may think I
or act on this subject, I trust* these will
always be the principles of South Caro- i
Una, and thai they will be sacredly rc- i
carded and faithfully abserred by all her t
public functionaries. 1 sincerely believe i
that they constitute the ia!i?n:>n of her I
political strength, and (hat if maintained,' J
the) will throw around her institutions a t
magic circle, which neither ambition n r I
fanaticism will rettlnre lo 'overleap.-- I
Leaving then the federal Government to |
run it* fated career* and standing proudly t
klool from al| th sc intriguing xombins- t
lions, (tad "entangling alliances** by c
which politicians may flatter themselves ?
that [hey are serving their constituent*, a
when they are only promoting their owo t
aggrandizement, let us dedicate all our I
faculties, and all our i-ITuu, to the iro* c
provement of utir bc'.ored Slate, in oil t
that can e *: tribute to her intelligence,-<
Wealth, power, and security. I
In the accomplishment of these natrio* f
tic ends, too much attention cannot be I
bestowed on the subject of education, in (
all its stages, and in|ail its branches. And t
i beg leave, most respectfully, to refer you i
lo Uie views entertained in my last annual s
Mfmge, iu rdilioo to the schools or ne* c
meniary instruction. It is in thrw hum- I
ble seminaries, thai the. rising generation 1
reeeire those early impressions, which d
exercise a permanent and decided inllu- t
ence, upon their eondaci and character in t
fofurc iile. g
They are emphatically the nurseries of '
freemen, and the wisdom of the State can 1
in no way so effectually pruritic for the 1
perpetuation of our free institutions, as 1
by measures calculated to derate their c
character, by securing competent instruc- '
lorn, and furiiiiinng for their air such '
elementary school book*, as will imbue 1
too minds of our youth with sound and 1
practical fiews, religious moral, and po- 1
litiral. J'
No constitutional charter, however j
viae its provision*, ran give freedom t? a .
people. We most have free men before
we can have a free Guctrnmtni; a.id we ,
cannot br loo deeply impressed with the
convirtion (hat the rssential qualifir ations .
of a frerrran^arc intelligence to comprehend
his rights and interests, with the
spirit and the military skill, which are necessary
to defend them. The fetal expe- j
Hence of but too many nations and com(nunitici'aronnd
us conclusively demon- j
Irate*, that where the body of the people
are destitute of these qualifications, j
every attempt at a? If government must
end in some new form of despotism. In
? ?r fiUhftnI in. '
my opinion our ?j ?inn? ?? ...
trocuon should bo made to assume a 4
more practical character* having a more 1
direct reference to the business and the f1
duties of active life. The common re- S1
Jiroach against a classical education, that! I
I tends to disqualify our young men from i
{performing these duties, as is not without i
some foundation- It is not uncommon to
mertvkb scholars, well versed in (he
systems of ancient polytheism. In the fables
of the ancient poets, and in the
scarcely less fhhclons Oars tires of the ancient
historians, who hare scarcely a
smattering of the history and constitutions
of their own country The effect
produced on llio minds of young men by
a loo csclusire attention to snch a ccurso
of reading in our. schools and cojlege^ is
similar to that which is produced on*the
minds of young females, by reading sentimental
norcls. It introduces Uiem into
a tvorlil of ftnev. entirclv different in ail
respects, from that in which they are dcatincd
to act a part, and evidently tends to
disqualify litem from acting that part,
amidst the ragged realities of life. To j
counteract this tendency, a concise popular
history of oar own country, written j
in n pure and simple style, and a dear ex- t
position of the great fundamental prinri- <
pies of onr system of fovatnment, J
should be introduced into ail onr grammar
schools. Por the purpose of effect- <
ing this desirable result, mrfioa shooM J
drat be adopted for nbtaioing^lmae works; j
and to secure their introduction into I
?ur schools. It should be provided In the 1
regulations of the Coledgr, that no young 1
man should enter the Sophomore Class i
who eonld not suand an examination on 1
the historical narrative, nor ihe Senior I
uIim who eonld not atand an examination
an the political exposition. <
With the aame view of firing a more i
practical bearing to our system of popular c
instruction, I suggest the expediency of 1
?stablishing in our College'a Professor- I
(hip ot Citil and Military Engineering, t
rhe works of internal 'approvement, which I
ire now in progress, end will probably I
rontinue to be protected for many years to 1
ome, its South Carolina and the neigh- I
toting States, will require the services*! ?
i number of civil engineers; end it is In |
ill respects desirable that we ahoold have i
iiizcns of our own well qualified In this t
ii*bly important department,'whose aer* i
ricea we can at all times command* Bo i
^reat ia the demand for this kind of scr- '
rice all over the Union, that the.rata of <
compensation is becoming extravagantly t
ligh, aod as a measure of economy alone, t
he establiahment of the proposed pro- |
essorsblp would be well Worthy of Connie
ration. I
Tkj j ? -*?-- :
?c uc|>an(nrni pi rauiury cu|mnn;i

traction in the use of artillery, ind to <
his may be u?efalfy added the practical i
nstraction of the young men, at certain t
tours, in the elements oi infantry tactics, i
fly observation and redaction, during the <
iresent year, have confirmed the opinion I
expressed in my last annual message, as i
o the expediency of combining in oar 1
renersl system of school instruction, the
ise of arms and the elomcnUof military i
actics, with the eommOn branches ofJi
ducat ton. There is no other modi, in '<
ny opinion, hy which such important remits
eah he nrndnred. with Si, amall SB IS
trpenditure of lime and money. Indeed,
I have great double whether it be not the
inly practicable mode in which the ale*
ncotary principles of military movements,
:an be scientifically imparted to the great
>ody of onr citizens. - It will supply the
nreet desideratum now MfpcfUmced in efectoally
training the militia,?competent
ifficers to command end instruct the nili>
ia companies; and I feel perfect issuance
that if generally pursued in onr
ichoola, the very next generation that
somes upon the stage of ective life,' will
w an army of citizen soldiers, better queified
to defend their rights, than any stealing
army in the world, altar a peace of
en years dorstioft. I suggest therefore, j
bat the youngmen of theCollege be or-',
poized Into one or two corpe of cadets, |]
?y law, or by the regulations of Ihe In- j
titution. and though permitted to elect
heir otrn officers, that they be required j
o devote certain hours to the exercise of
Irtlling. under the snperintendence of tba \
niliiary professor, who should be required ?
o an as Instructor. The establishment <
>1 #urli a system in the College, would, t
ip?n very obvious principles, cause it to i
ic extended to the grammar schools; as
rny young own, in preparing for colegr,
would naturally desire to qualify ,
limsrtf not onlv for performing his mili-i <
ary exercises,' but for expiring to the ho- ,
tor of a military command. In one of
he most distinguished grammar schools [
if the Stale, a company of Cadeta was
ormed almost under my own eye, and
rhilr their improvement in tardea was
itrikiug to every observer,?tho intellirent
gentleman at the head of tin inslituion
assured me, that ne derived great ad- (
rentage in ita government from tne maniness
and sense of honor Imparted to the .

I also recommend (be establishment of a ,
Professorship of modern languages, the tram ,
)f which has been tenons!y fut ever since ]
Lite establishment uf the College I believe ,
there are rery itw graduates of the insttto* |
tioo, who have not had oocasoo to deplore (
