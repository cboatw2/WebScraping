We are indebted to the publishers for a
copy of this work, which we were prevented
from noticing sooner, first by want of
time to read it, and afterwards by indisposition.
The Biblical Repertory, in a highly
commendatory review of it, says: " This is
a delightful little volume. It is short and
sweet" And we think most, if not all readers
will concur in the remark. We are
'persuaded that no Christian, and no one else
who wishes to regulate his affections and
form his character upon Christian principles,
can read it withont being profited, or without
being the better qualified to discharge
the social duties of society. It is an essay
> " - a ?? n i :j__ _ !
Upon 'Z rei. i. o?/ ; uusiucs, giving
all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and
to virtue knowledge, &c." and was written
by the author, who is a practising physician,
for circulation among the families whom he
used to visit in the discharge of his professional
dutfesir The readers of his former
publications must have formed from them a
very favorable estimate of his private character
; but the estimate must be heightened
by reading the present volume. We cordially
recommend it. The neatness of the
mechanical execution does the respectable
publishers credit. If, instead of prefixing
the present introduction, they had procured
Dr. Spring, whose church is near their store*
V 1 . 1
or seme one ojso 01 ins spirit arm talents, to
write one on the dependence of the sinner
upon his Maker for all gracious affections,
it would have enhanced the value of the
work for circulation in this country.
Wc have received tho first number of The
Common School Assistant, a monthly paper published
at the office of tho Cultivator, Albany, N.
Yn and designed for the improvement of common
school education It is edited by J. Orvillc Taylor,
and furnished to subscriber ul tho very low I
price of 50 cents per annum for a single copy;
for six copies, 8-- 00; and for twenty copies,
?5. 00. If the work should be as well conducted
es, from the specimen befbro u?, it promises to j
bo, it will bo a most valuable publication. There
i9 no art in such common use which seems to us
to be so littlo understood and so wretchedly practised
as that of school teaching. Infant schools
are the only ones which seem to us to be conducted
on proper principles.
Wo recommend the work to all teachers,?
especially teachers of the elementary branches of
education; and to all Trustees of schools for the
benefit of their tcaeher9.
The following very respectable testimonial of
it has been given to the publisher:
From the well known character and abilities
of the Editor of this paper, and the vital
importance of the cause it advocates, we
hope that every citizen will consider it his
duty to aid in giving the " Common School
Assistant" a circulation in every family and
school in the Union.

Both Houses of Congress are now engaged
in an undignified and most extraordinary
debate on the question, who caused
the loss of the fortification bill of last scs
sion?
Movements were made in Columbia, last
week, preparatory to raising a company of
volunteers for Florida; but upon communicating
with the Governor of the State on
the subject, he informed them that he could
not accept their services, inasmuch as the
number required had been supplied from the
Southwestern Brigades. The town council
> ?
of Columbia had appropriated $2000 for
the " equipment and comfort" of the volunteers.
A public meeting of the Anti-Van Buren
party of Wake county, lately held in Raleigh,
nominated Judge White for the Presidency;
Mr. Tyler, of Virginia, for the Vice
Presidency; and Gen. Dudley, of Wilmington
for the office of Governor of N.
Carolina. Gen. Dudley will probably be
the candidate of that party throughout the
State.
- - There have lately been four successive
fires in Natchez, iWiss., within the space o!
a very few days. No doubt is entertained
that they were the work of incendiaries.
The gamblers who were recently driven
from that town are supposed to have procured
the mischief to ha done. A fifth nt
i | tempt was made to burn what remained of
? ! the town. But the fire was discovered be. 1
s! fore it inflamed the shavings into which it
3 wss thrown. The loss of property is very
) great, and the consternation of the inhabit.
5 ants equal to that of the gamblers a few s
months since.

The Kentuckians seem a little joalous of Cin- j

which must accumulate at tho point of its termi- j.

, company for constructing tho road was before
I the Legislature of that State at the date of our f.
last accounts. A letter from the scat of govern.
mcnt to the Louisville Journal, dated January 19, n
says :
An amendment, adopted to-day, provides,

A company of 21 persons, only some o* ^
them armed, were despatched down to the j

was said, the Indians had crossed the river,
to inquire into the truth of the report.?
This company fell in with the Indians and n'
a skirmish ensued,in which two of the whites

Late accounts represent the body of the ?

mcnt, passed to-day, prohibits the company tf
from constructing a bridge over the Ohio tl
river. Of course the road, even if it goes
in the direction of Cincinnati, cannot reach
{that city, but must stop at Covington or ti
I Newport. A third amendment, passed by C;
the House, prescribes, that a branch of the
read shall be extended to Louisville, from tc
some point south of the Kentucky river. D
Mr. R. Wickliffe, jr. member of the
House of Ropresentatives from Lexington,
moved, to-day, to strike out Ciccinnati from n
the mil road charter and to authorize the 0'j
extension of the work to Louisville. The di
discussion of this question on account of in
the magnitude of the interests involved, has l0
been deferred till to-morrow. in
A letter to the Cincinnati Whig, dated January
20, says that Louisville, with the assent of Col. 11
Blanding, lias been rnado a poinst of termination 11
for a branch of the road, commencing North West
of the Cumberland mountain, but still sho is dis. fa
satislivxl.
The same letter adds :
Whether the Bill will finally pass, may be P1
considered somewhat doubtful, although I b(
think there is now a very fair prospect of
such an issue. We (the friends of the PJ
measure) arc gathering strength every day, di
and if another week be suffered to elapse
before the final disposition is made, there er
will be no doubt of the passage of the
charter, by a handsome majority. If car- er
ried in the House, the Senate will assuredly
approve it by a large majority. 13

INDIAN WAR.
Great alarm was lately produced in Columbus,
Georgia, from rumors that the Creek Indians
were about to attack that town; which
however, seems to have been groundless. in
The whites had killed r.n Indian, in de- til

The report that a wagon load of arms
sent by the autlwrittes of Georgia to the
frontier counties had been taken bv the Indians,
turns out to be false.
More than 81,300 dollars were lately
subscribed at a muster in Edgefield, " to aloviate
the condition of those who have

So says the Aikin Telegraph.
