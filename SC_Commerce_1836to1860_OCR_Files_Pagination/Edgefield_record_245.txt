Righly Important Decision of the Su
rreme Court of the United States.-Those
of our readers who are of the legal profes
sion, have doubtless read of the case to
which the Bank of the United States was
a party. which was tried before the Cir
cuit Court of Alabama, and afterwards
carried up to the Su preme Court. An ex
change paper tbus states the case:
. In 1837. the Bank of the United States,
having funds in Mobile, purchased a hill
of exchange to remit to New York . This
bill not having been paid either at New
York, or by the drawer, the Bank of the
United Staies instituted suit in the Cir
cuit Court of Alabama, to recover the mo
ney due on the bill. In that Court it was
-decided, that the contract involved in the
purchase of the bill, was void; because it
was a contract made by the.Bank of the
United States in the State of Alabama;
whereas, a Bank, incorporated by the
State of Pennsylvania, can do no act out
of the limits of Pennsylvania, &c. From
this decision an Appeal was made to the
Supreme Court of the United Stateq,which
reversed thejudgnent rendered by the Cir
cuit Court in Alabama.
Mississippi.-We extract from an ex
change paperi the following captions of

Branch Bank of Darien at Milledge

was passed, to suspend specie payment. It
was also
Resolved, That this Bank, will pay an
interest of seven per cent. upon all sums
of one hundred dollars, and over, deposited
in the bills of said Bank during the sus
pension.
The Cihier begs leave to say to the bill
holders of this Branch, that they need be
under no apprehension in relation thereto,
as the assets of this Branch are more than
ample to meet all its liabilities.
Bank of Hawkinsville.-Tbe Staidard
of.Union says in relation to this Bank:
We are acquainted with a number of
the stockholders in that institution, and
there areseveral of them. who could re
deem its whole circulation, if the bank and
all its effects were burnt uip and when it
is known, that the individual property of
the stockholders is bound, we cannot con
ceive the slightest cause of distrust.
A Taatr~tse [NcIDENT.-Who is not
pained and shocked at the fierce and vio
lent altercations which often take place in
Legislative bodies? Who is not filled
with deep sorrow to see the hateful and
vindictive passions exhibited by members
of opposite parties, towvards each other '
One almost thinks that these men have
lost all the kindly feelings of human na
ture. It seems to him that party spirit
has banished every thing good from the
breasts of these partizans. For the honor
of human nature, such is not the fact. Let
but some circumstance of a peculiar char
acter arise, and instantly every evil pas
sion is hushed--discord is banished from
the assembly, and good feeling universal
Jy prevails. A chord is struck in every
bosom. We have been led to make these
dent which occurred during the sessiun of
the late Congress.
We'extract the following from the Na
tional latelligencer.
When Mr. Cambreleng moved, in Sat
urday night's sitting, that the House go
into committee on the whole, on the state
- of the. Union, to take up certain appropri
ation bills.
Mr. Chambers asked him to withdraw his
motion to enable him (Mr. C.) to make a
statement; and Mr. Cambreleng havmng
wvithd~rawn his motiona. Mr. Chambers said
- the statemuent he wished to make related
to a matte, affecting himself, in Some'de
gree, and he would therefore bately sub
mit it to the House to do in the matter
wvhat might seem rigut ancf proper. He
said he had for some weeks past, and du
ring the last session, been waylaid about
the rotunda and on the stairs ahd passage
of the Capitol by a lean, hungry, starved
looking man, who met him at every turn,
and the vision ofwthose ghastly face haun
ted him even in his hours of rest.
This man had been one of the real Ia
boring men; a sub-contiactor-who had
macadamised the beautiful avenue imme
diately in front of the Capitol during a pe
riod of deep calamity and distress in the
city, *when the cholera prevailed. The
vupertntendetnt of the work having reserv
ed the right to abrogate the contract for
ani delay or suspension of the wvork, re
fusqed to pormit the contractor to superin
tend it, but sent physicians among tht la
borers to advise them not to work early in
the morning or late in the evening. and not
to work hard at any time. Disease, death
and alarm, soon dispersed the greater part
of the-operative force, the contractor was
ruined, and the sub-contractor was involv
ed in all the worst consequences of the
failure, and in debt for a great part of the
labor.
He had repeatedly been imprisoned for
debt, and separated from an interesting
family for want of bread to feed them; dis
ease had followed, and the man was now,
and had been, for many mionths hers.so
liciting justice at the hands of the Govern
ment, in a state of actual suffering for the
comforts of life, while this government
owed him upward of five thousand dol
lars, which for years he has been beg
ging for-yes begging for justice-for he
is broken in spirit, and suffering has almost
made him mtatd. The Senate (Mr. C. said)
had at last passed a bill for his relief, and
this day while the House was in session,
the comnmittee over which he had the ho
nor to preside (ad it was a high honor to
preside over that committeefor they earn
ed their daily bread) had examined the
bill, and ordered him to ask leave to report
It without amendment, and ask a depart
ure from all the rules which might obstruct
its commitment to a committee of the
whole; and he would even ask that it
should go to the committee of the whole
on the state of the union.
M. C begged leave to add that he had
some doubt whether this man had not to
day committed a breach of the privilege of
the House, for when the committee of
claims emerged from their room, the poor
fellow, as nsual, was in waiting at the
door, in fear and trembling, and on being
told the committee had decided to recom
mend to the House to pass his bill, and
that every effort would be made to get it
through, his salfv face turned pale as
death, and the fountains of his eyes over
Rowed, and the members of the commit
tee, without exception, though not greally
given to the "melting mood," joined in tbe
poor fellow's undignified expression of
feeling. The unfortunate nian, again saw
in prospect his suffering wife and lit
tle ones assembled around him, and him
self freed from the danger of a return to
his prison-it depended upon the House
whether it should be so or not.
[Tle good feeling of the House was
manifested by a general cry of "leave.
leave-" The bill was afterwards special
ly taken up in committee, reported to the
House, and passed pftei 4 o'clock in the
mornina.]- Nat. Intelligencer.

MAN-A PROGRESSIVE BEING.
Mr. Editor :
Man, we believe to be, a progressive
being. Desires to ameliorate his condi
tion-aspirations after something higher
and better, than at any one period he may
enjoy, are congenial to the mind of every
one, who has passed beyond even the
threshold of thought and intelligence. We
delight to review the past, and from the
retrospect to derive the assurances, that
we have advanced-to look forward to
the future, and indulge in the anticipations
Af still further progress. In these, his on
ward and upward tendencies-man ac
eords with the system of things around
him. Progression is written in charac
ters of living light, on every thing about
us. We see it in the seminal germe,
which, having been deposited within the
soil, and having passed through the minor
tradations-becomes, at length, the pride
of the forest, unfoldtng towards heaven its
leafv honors, and fixing its foundat ions
beneath, in the depths of the earth. .We
see it in the tiny rivulet-which, gushing
from the unnoted hill-side, and receiving
the influx of tributary streams-becomes,
finally, the highway of comtnerce-the
constituent of an ocean.
.We believe it not difficult to prove
that the present age is far in advatnce of
any that has preceded it-and still further,
that there are causes now in operation
which, in the ordinary course of events,
will result in the still further advance
rnent of the succeeding age. The first
which we would mention is the existence
af the idea, of universal education. Not
anly is this believed. to be f,enerally prac
ticable, but a systematic effort is now
in progress~ throughout this country
and Europe-which renders it not chim
erical to believe, that the time will come,
when the blessings of at least an elemen
tary education, will be as common as the
enjoyment of air and light.
Again-a spirit of free discussion-a
reafless-piercing inquiry into every thing;
:ibil-religious-political-however hal
owed by antiquity and sanctioned by au
thbtrity,. may be said to characterize our
age. This inquiring- tendency is guided
bay a more philosophic spirit than former
y. Alchymy has become Chemistry
Astrology has become Astronomy-Di
plomacy is no longer regarded as a sys
em ofcraft and dissimulation-but in Pol
tics as well as in morals, "to do unto oth
~rs, as we would that others should do
ato us." is found to be the beut, as well.
is the right rule. Thbe -lowerselasses are
evidently rising in importance. Through.
tnt Europe generally, the middling class
begins to be regarded as the main body
af the itation. A French mninister in the
soursne of a late debate, used this expres
nion-"the middling classes of society"
who are they?" '-asked .one of the oppo
sition"-"I was wrong," was the reply,
':we now know nothing but the people."
All these facts speak in a voice which
tarmonizes with some of the noblest aspi
-ations, and purest feelings of our nature
I'bey tell us in a language that cannot be
nistaken, that the race of man is treading
apidly along that glorious pathway, on
which is inscribed at every step, in bril
iant characters
"Sic itur ad astra."

"Thle intelligence has 6ea by tis time
pretty g%-nerally dissedildaitl that the
Branch df the Darien Bank at Savannah,
has suspended specie payments. Such
communications it might be supposed
would ordinarily be attreded with serious
consequences-producing either an actual
loss to that portion of the community who
may happen to be bill holders of that par
ticular Bank, or creating with the public
at large a distrust of the credit and solven
cy of all other Banke.
"Neither of these results will, or rather
should, follow this calamity, (for so we
esteem it.) The circulation of the Branch
of the Darien Bank in Savannah was very
limited, and the few who were so unfortu
nate as to be bill holders cannot eventually
be losers-for the assets of the Bank are
amply sufficient to indemnify them against
loss, to say nothing of the responsibility of
the stockholders, who are liable in propor -
tion to the stock they own. And when it
is taken into consideration, that the State
owns over two thirds of the stock, there is
nothing to be appprehended by bill hol
ders,-Macon Messenger.
The Brookville (Ind.) American states,
that the Hon. John Henderson, who has
just been elected a Senator of the United
States, by the Whig Legisiature of Mis
sissippi, was formerly a resident of Brook
ville, and there followed the trade of
Shoemaking. Having no little ambition,
he removed to Cincinnati, went to school
for some time, and then engaged in the
study of the law in theollice of Mr. Storer.
Front here he removed to Mississippi,
where he became a prominent lawyer,
matried a wealthy heiress, and is now
elected to oneof the most dignified and
important offices in the Government. Mr.
Henderson is a man of fine talents, and a
firm whig. His career is in a high degree
honorable to hini,and admirably illustrates
the true republican character of our insti
tutions. . It shows what perseverance, and
a laudable ambition, can accomplish in this
country.
From Freedon's Senlind.
"EVERY ONE TO HIS owN TRADF."
What shall a man do who has no trade?
Learn one. Every man need not be a
mechanic; but let every body have. some
honest employment, understand their busi
ness, "stick to their trade," and let other
people's affairs alone. This is the way to
grow rich, and, and live happy.
When Igo into a barber-s shop, and
hear Mr. Tonson, whose information ex
tends but little beyond the end or his sig~n
pole, prate politics, puff the French Direc
tory. and legislate for the American Con
gress, I say to myself, "Every one to his
trade."
When I see those whose profession is
the law' set themselves up as editors, and
who make but a poor out at that, I say to
myself if they dont know enough to get
their living by pettifogging, they had bet
shoulher the grubbing-hoe. or follow some
business better suitted to the intellect of
U1ockheads.
A wig, and a constitution, are very dif
ferent things; a man may be a connoisseur
in one, and very ignorant in the other,
Tonson's tongue proves ibis as fully as a
'strong argument chain."
The iudustrious farmer or mechanic
who i not content with small and s.re
gain, should remember "a bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush." Alier they
have tried their experiments in merchan
dise, horse-jockeying, or land specuilation.
they will have reason to lament their not
attending to my text. Any trade is good
if well followed.
A man may make more at journey work
in a poor trade, that he is aster of, than
by an apprenticeship in hetler business,
that he is unacquainted with.\
The Lawyer harangues fotr his clients
reads authorities. quotes precedent, rrfines,
defines, and splits hairs: says much that
you do not understand, much that you are
unable to contradict, and more that you
do believe; you hear him through from
"May ieplease you honors," to "I submit
it to you, gentlemen of the jury;" you-ap
prove of part-of the rest you onily say,
"He is a lawyer-every one to his tgle.''
But, sP~y ignorance, prejudic'e, -and
rogues, "This is ain unneccessary trade, a
hishonest trade." Hold, friends; "All
trades must live." While there are ro
gues, ignorance, and prejudice there must
be laws, and while there are laws there
must be lawyers, or every body must
leave their trades to study law. When
two persons are at variatnce, they think
very different of the merits of their cause;
they tell different stories to their lawyers,
both sides are sure of their cause. A law
yer is not a conjurer, he cannot tell whall
the witness will say when they come he
fore court. Out comes the truth against
the tunfortunate client, lie loses the case;
& makes a noise by cursing the profession.
Deal fairly with your neighbors, tell the
plain truth to your attorney, and you will
have but little occasion to speak ill of the
lawyer's trade.
