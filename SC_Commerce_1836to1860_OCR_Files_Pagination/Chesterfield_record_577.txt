their lives by leaving their tail behind.? I
The loss of life in this exploit is said not r
^to have been great the Chinese having had (
ample time to save themselves by flight j
before the vessel blew up. We arc sorry s
to have to record one casualty on board 0
the steamer; her gallant commander, ^
Captain Hall, was severely wounded in v
the hand by the bursting of a rocket.
During the action at Shaming, the rig.
ging and spars of the Modcste were a good
deal cut up and three men wounded; we
have not heard ofany casaullies on board a
fio mher two shins. Alter the destruction i 1
of the Shaming f? rt, the ships of war reti- 8
red to their anchorage in the iMacao pas. t
sage, waiting tor the squadron and forces s
on their way up the river. v
Oa the 234 the whole forces, naval and y,
military, had, by the Macao passage, ar- \
rived to within four or five miles of Can- f
ton; and even H. M. ships Blenheim had y
been able in spile ofher great draught of |
water, to proceed thus far. A great ma- j
ny Chinese chop-boats were seized at
Whampoa by the British, and they afforded
excellent canveyance for the troops. 1
On the 24th, It. M. 26th Regiment, r
under command of Lieut. Col. M aintain '
took possession again of the foreign facto- 1
ries <Sc wi-*re just in time to save the greater
p irt of them fro n destruction?driving | 1
from thence a mob of soldiers and thieves .
that had begun carrying away whatever
they couiJ. They were too late, however,
to save the Greek, Dutch, and Brit
ish Hongs; these have been comp ete ly (
sacked; every thing, even to the window ,
frames, has been carried away, and a (
large quantity of merchandise chiefly wo!lens,
which were stored in the Company's
/ Godowns, have become a prey to the
tuob.
On the 2oth the Carneronians were still
in possession of the factories, and the oth^
er troops consisting of the 19th Ro)al
r Irish H. M. 49th, the Madras 27th N. L.
altogether 1700 men and 500 marlines,
had, after some hard fighting, taken pos- 1
session of the heights to the north of Can- ]
- J i_: _ii .i_- a
ion, aria urivun an mo i unar troops mu?
the city, which was bombarded from the I
ahrps with rouod shot, shells, and rock- <
ets. .
On the 26th a general attack, it is said ,
was contemplated *"d parties who arrived
yesterday from VVharnpoa, which they j
left late on that day, report having heard (
a heavy canonade during a greater pait
of the day. It is therefore very probable
that whilst we are writing Canton is I
in possession of the English.
n We hear that, on tne 25th, enrlv in
the morning, Howqua and the Kwang- I
cbowtoo had an interview wilh one of the *
naval commanders, offering to negotiate I
for the saving ofthe city; that they ofTer- c
. ed five millions of dollars, to be paid with- (
1;in three months, and all damage done to, (
-suffered by, the British during the at- f
tack on trie city to he made good; that they |
further withdraw all troops from Canton, I
itntf ask for 40 days to effect it in. These ?
offers, if made, have, it appears, been re- i
fused. It would indeed, he the height of1 u
fdjly n??w again to enter into negotiation r
with the Chinese after the ample experi- !
ence we have had of their total want j c
i.f good faith. They prooil !y by these : a
rdfera wish to g.iin time, in order at some !t
future moment a .pun treacherously to , i<
break tueir promises when- vrr they jnuv i n
hope to-be nbieto attack the English with a
some advantage. j n
The number of the rafts p-epared hv c
the Chinese must have been enormou.se; !
they have been seen on all parts of the j
1 river belween Canton and the Bogue.?
Shrfte wera sent down upon the YVellesiy ,
(anchored off the Bogue) from Chuenpee; j '
others at Second Bar, upon the Futtay
Salam (ashore there) nnd theScaleby '
Castle; and the naval Senior Commander 1
has, we hear, issued a notice to the Chi-j1
nese that any village Irom which a fire : F
craft shall he seen to come, or the village v
nearest to the spot whence the fire craft , s
shall have been sent, is to be destraved, so c

In prosecution ??f this threat, the Sui-1 (
phur and Alligator have completely de-! v
stroved a village near Half Way Pagoda, [
whence tire rafts had tieen sent among v
the British shipping; and it is to be
hoped that this severe example will have J
the desired effect. H. M. Plenipotentia- s
ry has also issued a proclamation to the c
npnole of Canton, savins that, having on t
i 1 -- - ' cj o
several occasions been treacherously dealt
with l>y the Emperor's Commissioners, (
he now intends to drive them and their t
troops out of Canton, and warns peaceful [
inhabitants to leave the town without t
delay, in order not to he made to sutler for ,
the faults of their mandarins. ,
We are sorry to say that Mr. Millar t
was so very badly wounded that his life N
is despaired of; one of the crew is like- t
wise missing, probably killed, and all the ,
others are more or less wounded, andsuf- c
fering from the privations they have since J
endured. Mr. Coolidge has been liberated
in the same manner as the others. j
On Friday, the 21st instant, all foreign *
ers left Canton, pursuant to the above <
notice of Captain Elliot, and went to (
Whampoa or retired on hoard boats in the a
river, with the exception of Mr. Coolidge >s
and Mr Morse, two American merchants. s
Immediately on the factories being thus f
abandoned, the mob broke in, and were
with irreat difficulty, driven bv the soldie- e
e?
ry, who wanted no share in the plunder, f
The above named gentlemen were in (
great danger of violence from the mob v
and solders, hut Mr. Morse succeeded, by j
the assistance of a mandarin, to escape to
a river and into a hoaf, in which he reach- ?
ed VVhacnpoa, while Mr. Coolidge was, t
probably with a view to his protection, \
carried into the city. A boat from the (
American ship Morrison, which, with j
a crew of four and three passengers,
Messrs. Taylor, Miller, and Gutierrez, s
eft Canton for Wfiampoa on Fridav, was 1
icar the Fieneh Folly, fired upon by the i
Chinese, and, trying to escape by seek- <
ng shelter oil board a tea-boat on the <
outhcrn bank of the river, the passen- 1
;ers and crew were followed by the sol- i
liers, who very severely maltreated them, i
mounding most of them, and then carried
hem prisoners to the authorities at Canon.
We omitted to state in the foregoing
iccount of the hostilities at Canton, that
I. B. M. Algerine, after the forces had
irrivedut Canton, was placed opposite i
he Dutch Folly, which the Chinese had
itrongly fortified, and from whence a fire
vas soon opened upon the vessel, which
vas returned with interest ; the Chinese, j
lowever, defended the place with great 1
leterminathin, but it was at last carried.
>Ve regret, however, to learn that the (
oss in killed and wounded of the Algerine, ,
lasbeen vary severe, particularly among
he boat parties that were sent to carry '
be fort and several other masked batteies.
A lieutenant of the ship, whose
lame we did not learn, had, it is reported
lis leg carried oiF by a cannon shot.? 1

Etxract of a letter, dated

Macao, May au, ion. j
Mcss-s. Cary & Co.: Since the date of |1
nir general advices events of much irnwrtance
have transpired, a brief note of J,
-vliich may not he uninteresting to you. J
The excitement among the Chinese I
cferrr.d to, continued to increase until J1
:he ISth instant. When Captain Elliot L
irrived at Canton, it soon become known \
hat lie had already ordered the whole j
Jritish force, vessels of war. transports, i1
md troops, to the immediate vicinity of j
Canton; and his advice to his country- i
men was to close their business and pre- i
>are for removal with as little delay as
jossible. Up to the '20th instant, the
Chinese authorities had avoided holding j
my communication with Captain Elliot, i j
md matters wore a very dubious and i
jnsatisfactory aspect.
The local authorities, however, pub-|1
ished proclamations and sent messages I
hrough the Hong merchants and linguists j (
. I i
issuring all resident foreigners of their j
perfect safety in Canton.
On the evening of the 20th, all the
English residents had embarked, and only
lour or five Americans, confiding in the
assurance *fthe Chinese, remained in the 1
factories; the same night the Chinese
1
commenced hostilities by sending a fleet
)f fire boats and rafis against the vessels
>f war lying near the city, hut without 1
loing them any damage. ' 1
Tnis act was avenged by the Pylades (
ind steamer Nemesis, that attacked and i
lestroyed a battery near the factories and i
,bout forty fire boats and us many fire 1
afts.
On the morning of the 22d an Ameri- ?
an resident was scizcu ny uie vmu^o ,
nd taken from his factory; at tlie same <
iine that a bout,'belonging to the Amer. 1
can ship Morrison, with three passengers ,
ind seven seainen were captured soon
tfter leaving the factory for Whampoa, :
ind the party carried prisoners into the
:"y- . .
I- rom this the h'me was occupied by the ,
English in concentrating their forces
lear the city, until the 24th at 4 P. M. j
The Hyacinth 18. Mudeste 18, Pv lades
18, Nirnrod 18, Colnmhus 16, Cruiser 16, (
ind Algerino 10, having taken up their ,
position in front of the city and suburbs, I
pened their fire upon every offensive
mint of the Chinese, who returned it '
vith considerable spirit at first, but were j
con compelled to desert their guns. At i
> P. M. a body of.soldiers, about 400, 1
vere landed at the foreign factories, in j
he vicinity of which the Americans,
vho had been taken prisoners two days
?efore and examined by the authorities, i
vere released.
The tiring was continued until about 9
^
\ M., when the suburbs were on tire in (
everal places, and nearly all the batteries
inshore in possession of or destroyed by 1
he English.
While this was going on in front of
Uanton, (Jen. Gough was "landing bis
roops, 1800 men, at the foot of t!;e 1
icights, in the rear of the city, and on
he morning of the 25th he commenced
>perations. Particular's of the day's
vork are not yet known, further than
hat, with a loss of some 40 killed and
vounded, four batteries were taken from
he Chinese, and great numbers of their
itficers and soldiers killed, the heights
'ornmanding the citv taken, and the
Iritish forces entrenched upon them.
T\.o hwe nf P!hinp?:p nn this occasion
s variously estimated at from .3,000 to
>,000, and even as high as 10,000 men ;
ind they now find, to their cost and exrome
disappointment, that they are unible
to cope with European troops on
hore, as they have before proved them- ,
elves in their encounters with British
orces afloat.
On the "20th the vessels of war were ;
mgaged in quieting and destroying the | (
ew remains of opposition, and in the j
jvening mandarins called on the Captain
vith flags of trace, to negotiate for the
reservation of the city.
Our advices from the seat of action ]
tnd negotiation are to the morning of
he 27th, when it was said the Chinese
)ad capitulated, and offered a large sum
?f money for the ransom of the city, which
t was supposed, would then be saved.
It is scarcely necessary for usjto say that
incethe 11th nothing has been done in the
aiJgJBEJ
way of sales of imports, and that all ship
ments of teas, &c., cease on the 2lst
our establishment, in common with al
others, is again removed to Macao, am
we fear with a prospect of beiDg ob!ige<
to remain here for several months, inas
much as, in the event of a suspension o
hostilities, and Canton being left withou
further injury, we do not think the Brit
ish merchants will trust themselves then
while the British forces are drawn off t<
the northward. We think it will bi
iound necessary to renew the blockadi
of the port; and the most that we cat
hope tor under almost any circumstance:
is, that neutrals may proceed to Cantoi
to realize the foreign merchandise depos
ited th' re. and to complete the lading of thi
ships a ready in port.
VVe are without late intelligence from India,
but Commodore Bremer is daily expecter
on in the steamer Queen, to resume commani
of the naval forces ; and it is understood tha
a reinforcement of eight regiments, about
fi,500 men, is now on the way to China front
India.

FROM THE UNITED STATES OF YESTERDAY.
We ha ft) been favored with the following
interesting extract of a letter from a residen
American merchant at Canton. His viewi
as fo the early settlement of the existing dif
Acuities will, of course, not be concurred ir
by many of our readers, and by those interes
ted io the trade.
Macao May 31, 1341.
My last was per the LoweJl 16th instant
sirce when hosti itieshave recommended, and
as you see from the heading, we are all agaii
at Macao, too happy to have escaped with ou
lives. Trade had been going on quietly e
nough till within a lew days before the out
break when it became erident, from variou:
infringements on the pari of the Chinese o
the truce, that there uas to be another battle
large masses of soldiers from the interior be
ing collected in and about the city, to tin
number, it is said, of 50,(100; and Captaii
Eili. t'e circular, issued on the 21st, recommending
all foreigners to leave Canton imme
iliately, left no doubt about it and we all hur
ried oif instantly ; so suddenly, indeed, tha
several of my trunks, full of clothes, &c. wen
IhIt behind, and havesir.ee been taken off bi
the Cuinsse mob that broke into the fartoriei
immediately on our departure, and rifled ever
thing they could lay hands on. This, howev
er, was my only loss on the occasion, as m;
accounts and all valunbie papers are tortunat
ely preserved Many others have been ser
ious losers by the suddenness wi'h wind
they wese obliged to escape, to say nothing o
the immense amount of property and good
in the factories and hongs, much of which wil
doubtless be Inst to the owners until they cai
r*<imnpl the Chinese Government to indemnif1
them. You will see ail the particulars in th?
newspapers of course, and I need not there
fbie revert to them. Mad we remained i
jingle hour longer in the place there is n<
telling what might have been the consequenc
as the moment the guard of marines wa
withdrawn the work of destruction commenced
Phis is the second narrow escape I have ha<
frum Canton, and, I assure you, I have hai
pule enough of it. A few hours afier the for
eigi.ers were out the attack commenced, an
cannonading and burning were the order c
I tie da)'. Canton is not yet destroyed, bu
military possession was taken of the height
and suburbs by the British forces on the 26th
and they certainly would have botnbardei
and she Med the place had not the Chinese au
ihorities offered to ram-mrn it at eight million
of dollars, payable in eight successive days
Although we have nothing official on the sub
ject, such is believed to be the result of tin
negotiation-of the last few days. Many thou
sand Chinese, ha,ve been killed, and there i
some hiss on the Brit shside, but not ofmucl
consequence. Part of the suburbs have beei
burnt, and the whole city was near sharinj
(he same fate. We have a report to day tha
the ti: st instalment of one million has beei
paid, and Canton will thus escape destruc
liop.. Thus the Chinese have drawn upoi
upon themselves at last signal punishment fo
their breach o fgood faith. They have hai
a second lesson, not to be easily forgotten
I'Ko P'.nrrliah haup actt-i] thrniiorhout witl
much forbearance and moderation, bet thi
Emperor'sorders were positive that no termi
should be made, and it was supposed that
wuh their numerical superiority, they woul<
have made better resistence ; but it is nov
clear that their numbers avail but little whei
opposed to European skill and courage, Th<
British steamers and ehips got up very noa
iliecitv, and fired with destructive effect
the Chinese must be convinced that they can
not stand, although in some places they mad'
a desperate resislence.
Many of the factories are destroyed; and i
r-ver the p!ace is occupied again as a seat c
trade; they w ill have toerect new ones. Ttv
impression i? now gaining ground that Hon)
Kong will he the place of business, and tha
it will bo built up during the summer. Stil
I am inclined to think that Canton will retail
a share of the trade, and should not be muci
surprised if we were back there again en
long, carrving on trade as usual. The lates
account we have i?, that the forces intern
proceeding up the river to Foshan, a city t<
large size about twenty miles above Canton
and there make similar demonstrations, afte
which they will probably proceed along tin
coast, attacking the various cities, and finalh
bring up at Pekin. All this is only in casi
matters are not previously settled here, o
which now I tf ink there is a better prospec
than at any former period ; and it is not iin
probable we may soon have the trade opei
again, although in the mean time a sufficien
quantity of tea has gone forward both to Eng
land and America, and before that is exliausted
I have little doubt that trade will be re
surried, or teas got out in some way or other
and esoecially when the former results o
Cant. Ell oil's remarkable disposition for thi
negotiating is taken into view.
Extract of another letter, dated
Macao, May 31.
" Every thing here at the present moinen
is in a state of utter derangement and con
fusion. The Chinese are at. last paying dear
ly f'ir their arrogance and o stinacy, foolish!]
resisting all accommodation, and relying ot
their uumtiers, and utterly ignorant of tin
force and skill that can be brought to bea
upon them by the Western nations. Cantor
is at the mercy of the British, and it is sai<

by the offer of eight millions, to be forthcom
* f
- Ing immediately, or foiling that, hostilities'to
. recommence. We ?n<uv nothing officially as
I yet, but if they pay up, the city will be spared.
. There has already been great destruction of
1 property and life among the Chinese, and it
j would have been better for them had thev lis"
. tened to reason before. It will be attended,
j- however, with very beneficial effects on the
foreign trade with this country, and sooner or
later the Chinese Government wiil have to
- come to terms, although to effect this it may
s be necessary to carry the war along the coast,
and up to Pekin."

? TWENTY DAYS LATER FftOM CHINA
i The news per Narragansett w;is to the
g 1st of'June. We now find that the Naragansett
had a long and tedious passage down the
I j China St. a, and at Anger Point was overtaken

i i On the 1st June, before the N. left Macao
II loads, news was received that fighting had
t j ag'ain taken place with some newly arrived
I j troo.vfi "'id that a few foreigners who had re
) turned to look aftpr pome of their property.
were again o'oligod to retire to their boats,
t Below are a few extracts made from the Cani

i' 4*Arrangeinei:f8 made between II. M. Plenif'

J proceed 60 mil? s.
2d. Six million dollars to bo paid as a ransom
for the city, within one week commenc.
ing 27th ,'Way ; one million to be paid before
f sunset of that day.
' If the whole sum is no* paid within 7 d?ys
' to be increased to 7 millions, if not paid with
in 14 days, to be increased to 8 million?, if
>! not paid within 20 days to be increased to 9
- millions.
When the whole sum is paid, the British

* not until affairs between the two countries are
1! settled. Loses occasioned by the destruction
r of the Spanish Brig Bilbaino and the factories
to be paid.
"The Quang chowfoo shall produce
' full power to conclude these arrangements
on the part of the three Commissioners.
The troops had returned to their ships
> previous to the 4th inst., after having suflifered
a good deal from exposure in the
- marshy ground back of the city. The
* Chinese even sent collies to assist in
* taking their trap3 to the boats, being glad
s to help rid themselves of such troublesome
j visitors.
s When the troops were being drawn ofF,
f one company was found to be missing.
* but after a short search were descried up
7 to their knees in a marsh, defending
themselves against superior numbers at
* the point of the bayonet, not being able
f to discharge their muskets on account of
9 the rain which was then falling. Thev
II j were rescued from their perilous situation

Sir Le Fleming Senhouse, who com.
^ manded the naval forces in the absence of
0 Sir Gordon Bremer, died at Hong Kong
e 1 on the 14lh June, and was buried at Ma?
cao, at his own repuest, in preference to
' the former place, it is supposed his death
j was occasioned by heat and over fatigue
j attending the attack upon Canton. Great
* j sickness also prevailed among the troops
and seamen at Hong Kong,
t Capt. Elliot had been sick a week,

i? had also been very ill. Six million dol.
^1 lars had been paid?five in silver and one
in securities. The forces had left the
9 river, except the Calliope and Herald at
1 Whampoa; the Nimrod sailed with de.
e spatches for Bengal. Captain Barlow
- j was to proceed from there to England with
a! despatches for the Admiralty.

An extraordinary girl.
A letter from Mariette, (0.) in the Cini
cinatti Chronicleofthe 11th inst., gives the
, following account of a remarkable young
i female artist in the vicinity of that
| town.
i An Original Genius.? It was a pleas
| ant evening, on the day subsequent to
I the commencement, when a friend took
j me up the Muskingum some miles, to see
| a lady whom he deemed worthy of no!
tice. She was the daughterofa French.
I man, who had been a teacher of that
| tongue till he purchased a small farm near
; this place, and turned his thoughts from
| the fielJs of mind to the fields of corn.?
It seems th t his daughter hat* seen ahout
two years since, a new fashioned dress
at a ball. Oa her return, she took a piece
of charcoal and drew the dress accurately
on the white walls of her room. Her
mother seeing was surprised, and said that
she had best paint the rest of hfr room.
Upon this hint, she went on and actually
painted the walls of her room withhistori
ical drawings, which were literally charcoal
sketches."
From charcoal she proceeded untutored
to oil paintings, and when I was there,
had covered the waits of the hall and parlor
with most curious and unique works of
genius. On one side of the hall opposite
the parlor door, she had drawn another
door, half open; and from the opening,
herself, large as life, peeping into the
j hall. Look^ng'through the room door at
J this piece, the figure seemed actually al|
live. On another side she had painted the
| interior of a room, and, seated at n sup;
per table, a gentldmen, his wife and little
l -l:i.i knl/linrr mil hio hnnil In
CIJIIU IIIU HUlini in/mill- vu? ?...catch
the laughing 4nfant. In another
place was painted the Elopement, In
this she represented the window and the
part of the room of a lady's apartment.?
She had agreed to elope, but when her
