On comparing. with care't1e reply with
the teniarks, I an at a loss.to determine
whether ii is the mnost remarkable for its
omiissions or mtis-stattements. Instead of
leaving nota hair in the head. of my argu
4ents, as' the v Seatathreatened (to use
- hivoot-ery dignified expression,) he has
not even atttempted to answer at large, and
not the least weighty portion; and of that
which lie hIs, there is not one fairly stated,
or fairly answered., I speak literally, and
without expggeration, uqr would it be diil
eult t o bstablish to the letter what I assert,
if i could vreeprcile it.to myself to consum ae
the time of the Senate in establishing a long
oseies of negative propositions, in whiceb
they gould ta'ke but little interest, however
- impohqui. they may be regarded by the
Senator and myself. To avoid so idle a
consumption of the time, I propose to pre
sent a few instances of his mis-tnatements,
from which the rest may be inferred; and,.
that I ay not be suspected of having se
lected tim, I shall talkesthem in the order
in which they sta nd in his rp .
The Senate will recollect Pt Iwhen the
Squator from Virginia farthest from me
(Mr. Rives) introduced his substitute, lie
accompanied it with the remark, that it was
his first choice, and- the second choice of
those wbo-are allied with.him on this oc
casion. In noticing this remark, I stated,
that if I might judge from appearances,
whieb could.scarcely deceive one. the Sen
ator nigh' :I've said, not only the second,
- but, under existing circumstonces, it was
their first choice,-and that, despairing of a
bank for the present, they would support
"his-substitute. Assuming this inference to
be correct, I stated that the question was
narrowed down, in fact, to the bill and stub
stitute, of which one or the other must be
selected.
The Senator from Kentucky, in his reply,
omitted- all these qualifications, and repre
settled me-asmtiking the absolutr assertion
that,.in the nature of thecase, there was no
other alternative: but the lill or the substi
tute, and thei dAtly pointed out two oth
ers; to do nothhag, or adopt a national'bank,
as if I could pusibly be ignorant ofwht
- was so obviobs. -After lie had thus replied
not to what I really said,'but his own mis
statement of it; as if to make-compensatioz),.
he proceefed in the hame. hreiath to confirm
the truth oflthat l did iny by giving.is.
slpport to tie substitute; which he'ealled a
hal-way houserwhere hie could spend some
pleasant hours. Nothing Is. more easy than
to win-such victorier.* ,

---a ;f he rem'aov:t of Oi deposites, de
nounced a league ot 6ait banks, similar to
thiat proposed to be revived by the substi
tute. . After enlarging on this point, I re
.uarked that, if I might be permitted to state
mny opinion, the gentlemen had taken a
.course unfortunwte for thenselves and the
country; unfortunate for them, for let what
would come they would be responsible. If
the bill wvas lost, theirs would be the respont
sibility; if the subastitute wvas carried, on
thenm the responsibility would fall ; and, if
nothing wvas done, they wvould be held re
sponisible; and unfortunate for the country,
because it had preventced- the detision of the
question at the extra'session, wiich cotl
not have failed toaput anm early termination
.to the present commercial and pecuaniaryr
embarrassment. This the Senator, in Is
reply, meot by stating that 'lhad called on
him and his friends to follow my lea'd, and
thus 'regarding it, lhe made it the pretext of
somte ill-nattured personal remarks, which I
shall antice hereafter. I never dreamed of
making such a call; anid what I saidl cannot
lhe tortured, by the force of constrttion, to
hear a mening having the least semblance
to it.
- A fer manking these ptreliminiary remarks,
I took up) the substitutge, and showed that it
4 proposed to make a bargain with the banks.
ithen stated the particulars and the condi
tiotns of the proposed bargain; that its ob
ject tras to enatale the hunks to pay their
debts, ands -for that purpose it proposed to
confer important prnvideges; to give them
the use of the public funds from 'he time of
dleposite to dlisbursement, atnd to have their
notes received as cash in the dlues of Go
v'ernmment. I then asked, if we hod a'righat
to make sute~aha baragain? The Senator,
leaving out all these particutlars, represent
ed tme as sayinig that the Government had
no right to mtake a bargain with the hanks;
andI then undecrtakes to involve me in an in
consistency, in sutiporting the bill because
it proposes -to bargaitn with the banks for
the use of their vantits, ns a place of safe
keeping for the public mtoaney. as if there
was a possible analogy hetwetn the two
eases. Nothig is-mnre easy thtan to refaute
-the most detnonstrative argument in this
way. Urop an essential port of the pra
maises, amid the-most irresistible conclusion
of course foils.
In the same summary anad easy mode of
replyinig to mny, arguments, thte Sentator per
verted my dlential that the government had
a right to receive bank anotes uts cash, into
the assertion that it had no right to receive
any thing bt cash ; atnd theta accused me
wvith inconsistency, because I voted at the
extra session, for the bill authuorizinag the re
eeipt of'Treasury tnoles in the dues of thie
*Goveranmenat; as if any one ever doubted
that it could receive its owtn aef, or aecu
rities itt pay of its debats. Such are the
mis-statemnents of the Senator, takena in
their regular order, as they stanad itt his re
ply, and they present a fair specimen of
what he 'ehooses to contsider an answver to
nay argument. There is not one less uta
fairly stated', or tunfamirly met, than time in-'
stances I htave cited. ** * * *
B~ut, in so premeditated and indiserimi
nato an attack, it cotuld not he expected

imputatlion sinks to the enih with the
itwndIess charge onl which it rests. I slamp
it with scorn in the dust. . I pick up the dart
Vhich foil harmless at my feet. -1 hurl it
baqk.- What the Senator charges on me
unjustly, he has actually' done. le went
over onl a memorable occasion, and did not
leave it to time to disclose his motive.
The Senator next tells us that I bore a
character for stern fidelity, whicl he ae
companied.with remarks implying that I
had forfeited it by my course on the. present
occasion. If he means by stein fidelity a
devoted attachment to duty and pr Ieiple,
which nothing can overcome, the character
is.indeed a high one, and, I trust, not en.
tirely unmcrited. I have, at least, the au
thority of the Senator himself for saying
that it belonged to me before the present
occasion, and i' is, of course, incumbent on
him to show that I have since forfeited it.
Ile will find the task a lierculean one. It
.would be.by'far more easy to show the op
posite, that, instead of forfeiting I have
strengthened my title to the character; in
stead of abandoning any principles, I have
firmly adhered to then, and int, too, tun
der the most appalling difficulties. If I
were to select an instance in the whole
course of my life ott which, above all otht
ers, to rest my claim to the charactet- which
the Senator attributed to me, it would be
this very one, which he has selected'to prove
that I have forfeited it.- I acted with the
full knowledge ofrhe difliculties I had to en
counter,, and the responsibility I must incur.
I saw a great and powerful party, probably
the most powerful in the country, eagerly
seizing upon the catnstrqphe whici had be
fallen the currency, and the consequent em
harrassmnents that foll6wed, to displace those
in power, against whom they had been long
cotendig. I saw that, to stand between
them and their objects, I must necessarily
incur their deep and lasting displeasure. I
also saw that, to maintain the Administra
tion in the position they had taken, to sepe
rate the Government from the banks, I
would draw down or me, with the excep
tion of some of the S >uthern banks, the
whole weight of that extensive, concentra
ted and powerful interest-the tost tower
ful by far of any in the whole community
and thus . would'unit, ngainst me a com
bination of political and monied influcuce
almost irresistible. Nor ivas this all. I
could not but see that however puro and dis
inlorested my motives. and however consis
tent my course-with all I had ever said or
done, I -would be exposed to the very char
es and aspersions which .I am now repel
hng. The case with which they could be
made, and the temptation to make them, I
saw, were too great to be resisted hy the
party, morality of the day, as groundless as
I have 'demonstrated them to be. But there
was another consequence that I could not
but'foresee, far more painful to me than all
others. I but too clearly saw, in so sudden
and cQmplex a juncture, called on as I was
to decide on my qurse intantly,.as it were,
on the field brf*tiewihowutcosultation,
or explainiug my- reasons, 1 would estrange
for a time many of my political friends, who
had passed through with me so many ti ials
,and difliculties, and for whom I feel a
brother's love. But I saw before me the
path of dity, and, though rugged and hedg
ed on all sides with these and maty other
difliculties, I did not hesitate a moment to
take it.
After I had made up my mind as to my
coutrse, in a conversation with a friettd a
bout the responsibility I would ttssutme, lhe
remarked tha&tamy owtt State might desert
mec. I replied' that it was not im possible
but the result luau proved that I under e.sti
mated the intelligettce and patriotistm of my
virtuous and tnoble State. I ask heur pardoun
for the distrust imp)lied in my atnswver, but I
ask'wvith assuratnce thatit wvili be granted
Ott the grouands I shall put~ it--that in being
prepated to sacrifice her cotnfidence, as denar
to meo as light and life, rather thhnn disobey,
ott this greal question, the dictates of mny
judigumett andI conscience, I provedl my'self
worthy of being her represetntative.
lBnt, if the Senator, itt attribunting to me
stertn fidelity tmeant, not dev'orion to prin-.
ciple. hut to party. and especially the p~arty
of wvhich lieis so) promnntt a membeor, my
answer is, that I never belonged to his par
ty, or owed it any fidelity; junl of course
could forfeit, in reference to it, no character
for fidelity. 'It is true, ite acted itn concert
againsut what we believed to be the tusuirpa
tions of the Executive; and it is trute, that
during the time, 1 saw much to'esteem in
those wvith wrhom I acted, anud contracted
friendly relations wvith many which I shall
not-he the first to forget. It isnalsoutruethat
a commnon party designationt was aphplied to
the Opposition in the aggregate, not, how
ever, with amy approbation; btut it is no less
true than at was universally knowrn that it
consisted of two distinct parties, dissimilar
in priatciple and policy, except in relation
to the object for which they had utnitedi; the
National Republican party, and thme portioni
of the State Rights party wvhich had sepa
rated from thme Aulaministration,ont the ground
that it had departed from the trie pripei.
pIes of the original pmariy. That I belong
edi exclusively to that detached portion,and
to nteither the Op~position nor Administration
party, I prove by my explicit declaration,
conaiinedl in one of the extracts read froma
toy speech on the currency in 1834. That
the party generally, atnd the State which I
represent in part,stood aloof front both of the
parties, may be established from the fact
that they refused to) mingle in the party and
political contests of tihe day. Mly State
withheld her electoral vote in two succes
sive P'residenutial Eliectionis; and rathlier than
to bestow it on eithaer thieSenator fromIKy.,
or the distinguished citizen wvhom hie op
posed, in the first of those elections, she
thtrew her vote on a patriotic citizeti of Vir
giia,. since deceased, of her own politics,
but whlo was tnt a candidate; and int the
last, site refused to give it to thme wvorthvy
Senator from Tennessee near me, (Judg~e
White) though has principles atnd views of
poliey approached so much nearer to hers
than that of theo party to whuicht the Senator
fromn Ketmucky belonigs. .But- suppose the
fuct wvas otherwvise, and! that the twoe par
ties had blendedl so as to form one, and that
I owed to the Utnited party as much~l fidelity
as I do( to that to wichii e xehtsivelhy he
joinged. even nna tmt snatst,... n.c~

robryj lace
rlidtftoetty a cai'virtues,
but I assigh to It .ise. con'
flue it to atteru o eta si aaement,
and to minor quiestIons'of policy. Bd
that, on al.questions involving prinepalss
or measures calculated to effect matrly
the permagent interstof the country, I loot
only to God eAd own"r.
But the Senator did Qot confine his at
tack to my conduct and inotives in refor-4
Once to the prtent gestion. ' In his eager.
ness to weaken the eauate I support by do
gtmyIng confidence in me, he made an iu
discriminnte attack on my intellectualfia
ulties, which lie character as ' itaphys
ical, eccentric, too much of genIus, and too
little common sense, of course wanting a
sotinl and practical judgment.
Mr. Presidtnt, according to my opinion.
there is nothing of which fihco who are
endowed with superior mental 'faculties.
ought to be more-cautious tlan to fepmach
those with their deficiency td whoni Provi
dence has not-been so liberal.' The facuties
of our mind are the immediaie gin of our
Crcalor, for Whiih we are no farther re-'
sponsible than for theii pioper cultivationti
according to our opportunities, and their
proper application to cebntrol and regulate
our actionls. Thus thinking, I trust I shall'
be the last to assume superiority on my part,
or repreach any one with inferiority on his ,
but those who do not regard the rule, when'
applied to others, cannot expect it to be ob
served when 'applied to themselves. Thew
critic must expect to be critized, and l who
points out the faults of othel-s, to have his
own pointed out.
I cannot retort o6n The Senator the charge
of being. neaphysical. I cannot accuse
him of possessia the . powers of analysis
and generalization, those higher faculties of
lae mind (called metaphysical by those who
do not possess them,) whicla decompose & re
solve into their elements - the complex
mnasses of ideas that exist in a world of mind
as chemistry does the bodies thant surround as
its %he material world ; and without which
those deep and hidden causes which
are in constant action nild producing such
mighty changer its the condition of society.
would operate unseen and undetected.
The absence 6f these higher qualities ofthe
mind is conspicuous throughout the whole
course of the Setinator's liublic life. . To
this it may be traced that ie prefers tie
specious to the solid and the plausible to the.
true.
To thesme cause, comhi-ied with an Ir
dent temperament, it is owing that we ever
ind him mounted 6n some popular and fa_
vorite nioneqres which lie whips alogg,
cheered by the shouts of the multitude, and
never disimounts till lie has rode it downa
Thus, at one time we find him inounted.en
the protective system,which he rode down;
at another, on- internal improvement., and
now he is mounted on a hank, which will
share the same fate, unless those who fe
immediately interested shall stop him inwhs
headlong career. It is the fault of hismi d,
to seize on a few prominent and striking r.
vantages and to pursue.them pagerly-%i
out looking to consequences. Thus i
.naseofshegagygystyg, b.a
with the advantages otf manufa
believing thitt high duties was *e prer
mode of protecting them, lie I -shed Ir
ward the system.without seeing that he wras
enriching one portion of the country at the
expense of the other; corrupting the one and
alienatimag the other; and finally, dividing
the community into two great hostile inter
ests, which terminated in the overthrow of
the system itself. So, now, he looks only
to a uniform currency, and a hank as the
means of securing it, wvithout once reflect
ing how far the banking system has pro
grossed, and the ditliculties that inmpedeo its
farther progress; at bankinag aid polties
tare riamng together to their mutual des
truactioni; andl that the onaly possible mode of
savinig his favorite system is to separate it
from the Government.
To the dlefects of tinderstanding, which
the Setntor attributes to me, 1 make tao re
p)1y. It is for others, and not for me, to
deterniuine the portion of understandinag
which it has'pleased the authonrof nmy being
to bestow oin me. It is, however, fortunate
for me; that the stanidard by which I shall
bie judged, is not the false, prejudiced, and,
as I have shown, unfounded opinlion which
the Senator has expressed; bait my acts.
They furnish materiadls, necithier 'few nor
scanat, to form a just estimate of nay mental
faculties. I have nowv been more than 26
years continuously ii the service of this
Government, in various stations, and have
taken part in almost all the great questions
which have agitated this country during
this long and import ant pea iod. Through-~
out the wvhole,l have never followed events,
baut hnve taken my stanad in advance, open
ly and freely avowing my o.pinions on all
questions, andI leaving it to time and expe
rience to condemn or approve my course.
Thus acting,I have often and on grent ques
tions, separated from those wit hwhoin I
usually acted. and if I am really~so defec
tiave in sound and practical judgment as the
Senator represents, the proof, if to be found
any where, must be foundl in such instan
ces, or where i have acted on my sole re
spoiisibaility. Now, I ask, in which of the
mnany instances of the kinad is such proof to
lie found? It is not amy intention to call to
the recollection of the Senate all such; bit
that you,, Senators may judge for your
selves, it is in justice due to myself, that I
should suggesh a fewv oft the most prominent,
which at the time were regarded as the
Senator now considers the presept; and
then, as now, becnase wvhere duty is inavolv
.ed I would not submit to party trammels.

MIURDER.--Our town has aganbe h
scene of deadly violence. A yong man
nameid .Nazareth Allen, an apprentice to the

honging, to Col. J. J. Chappell, wvith a dirk
knuife, immediately through the heart.
It dloes not appear from the evidenegiven
before the inquest that the boy gave lain) any

WEDNEsDAY, April 4th.
The Convention met at 10 o'clock.
Gen. Ilayne of Charleston, Chairtman of
the Select Coimmnittee, rose and read in a
clear and distinet mainner, the able'report,
w-hich wvas listened to with breathless Si
lence. After lie had finiishied reading the
report, (which we hope to be able to lay be
fore our readers in our next paper,) he re
quested Col. Memmitnger to read the roe
lutionis reported by the committee, whic'h,
with some additions and amiendmenits made
by the Conivemtion, were as follows, all of
which were adopted.
I. Resolved, That a direct trade is the n
tural channel of commulnication between
nations, wh-lich oler to each other the best
market for their miutual productions; and
that the intervention of a third party must
operate as a tax upon the exchanges be
tween them.
2. Resolved, That the Southern and
South-western States of this union afford
those staples with which are purchasedl
nearly the wvhole foreign imports of the
country; that they are te consunmers of a
large portion of these imports, and oudht
naturally themselves to furnish the channel
through which she exchange is made; that
ont no occasion- have their citizens been,
found ineapable of maintaining themselves
in fair competition with other sections; and
that the diverstion of their tradeo from its
natural channels, must have been brought
about by the unequal actiotn of the federal
government, or by the abstraction of our
people towards oilier pursuits.
3. Resotted, That in the opinion of this
Convention such a state of things shouild no
longer continue; that the present condition
of the commerci-rerLlations of the country,
and the disruption of the existing channefr
of trade, all'ord an opportunity of breaking
down the trammels whlich have so long fet.
sered our commerce, and of restoring to the
Souith its natural advantages; and that it is
imncumbent upon every tian, who has at
heart the good of his counttry, to lend his
best exertions to the promotion of these ob
jeets and to establishi our trade upon a sound
and permanent basis.
4. Resolved, Thsat this Convention is fully
aware of the difficulties to be overcomte i~n
te prosecution of their enterprise; bt no
thitng dauntted thtereb~y, and fully relying up
n the public spirit and zealous co-operation
of their fellow citizens, they are determined
to advance ivith untiring perseverence; and
with that view, do earntestly recommend
the adoption of the following mpasures.
1. That an effort should be nsiade to af
ford to thme imnorters nm p......sera
Sfs- $,;he spne-feilities wi
-re, anil with this vic
11 * I'
t at the banks in the
IWmediately apply a portion
ive -apitals to the purchase
offoreign .e'xchange, and to the procure
.nent ef credits or fMuds in Europe; -and
thait they should afflord the use of, tie stine
to the importing merthint upon a discount
or collateral pledge of, fh good paper as
lie may take from the " erclinns of the in
terior. and that this accoinmodation be uf
forded as well upon paper having more itan
six imonths to run, as upon hamt having less;
and that the Banki. s he interior co-ope
rate by collecting n'd.. otitting the pro
ceeds of such paper to the banks on ihe sea
coast; that they maintain-the credit of their
bills, tind keep down the exchanges by re
de6nig their own paper at the seaports;
anl that on the other band the honks in the
Southern Atlantic ities make arrangetnts
by which the notes of all of- them shall be
a ar in each. 4
,. That widh a Niew to the important
subject ofequatlizing the exchanges between
Southern and South-Western States and
Territories, this Convention earnestly re
conhinend to the various banks of the prin
eipal cities of those 8tates, or such as may
be conveniently locted, to receive the
Bills of each other in their general business
and to adopt such arrangements for settle
ments, at short periods, as they nimay deem
