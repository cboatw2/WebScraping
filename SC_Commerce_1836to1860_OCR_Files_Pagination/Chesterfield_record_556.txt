PROPER TIXR OP CUTTING WHEAT.
The period of maturity mast proper in
every respect for the cutting of wheat
has long been a subject of discussion ?
So long as wheat was thrashed by hand,
it was found necessary to let it ripen fully,
or the loss in thrashing would exceed the
gain from any other source; but since
machines have been generally introduced,
^ this difficulty has passed away, and the
^ question placed on other grounds. It is
now, how does early cutting affect the
weight and quantity of grain and the quality
of flour, as compared with that harvested
at a later period? Many experiments
have been made to test and settle
this matter, but the best and most satis,
factory we have seen, are those detailed
in the last No, of the Q. J. of Agriculture
made by Mr* Hannam, of Yorkshire, an
intelligent and able farmer. Mr. Han.
nam selected for his experiment a field of
the old xquareheaded red wheat, and on
the 4th of August, 1840, cut a sheaf.?
Both straw and ears were green and full
of sap. The grain was perfectly formed,
but the chafT adhered firmly to it, and it
was so soft and full of milk, that the
lightest pressure reduced the whole to a
pulp. This sheaf stood in the field a fortnight,
when it was housed, and the same
day* August I8th another cut. In this
the wheat was not ripe, but what is called
"raw." The straw for a foot from the 1
ground and. ahox$^ Jhftt, 1
lough to appearance green, still was"**
turning yellow. The grain though still
aft and mashed easily, was not near so i
fcU < f ftaid or milk as before. At the I
end of a fortnight this sheaf was housed, t
and September 1, or the same day another ,
was cut. This last sheaf was ripe, the
traw uniftcmK' yellow, but not so ripe as
to have the heads break, or grain fall
out, and the end of a fortnight this was
also housed. Each sheaf was carefully
preserved, and finally thrashed and the
chaff separated, by itself. The gross
weight was ascertained by an accurate
balance, as was that of a fixed measure,
*n#t An paiiai number of the grains. The
- c.,
result wasas follows, the experiment of
weighing 1*eif?g several times repeated to
prevent error:

100 straw* of an equal length were
then selected from uach of the bundles,
and weighed as follows:
Gree* 550
Raw 475
Ripe 450
To ascertain the actual value of each
quality, samples of .each were exhibited
to an extensive wheat grower, and then
put into the hands of a factor and miller,
to know what they would give. The
opinion of the grower and the miller was
as below:?
Value per qua. by Value per qua. by
the wheat grower. the miller.
Greea 61s 61s.
Raw 64s 03s.
Ripe 62s 02s.
It appears from these experiments that
the "raw" wheat had the advantage over
the "ripe" in every respect?
1st, weight of gross produce,
13 1-5 perct.
2d, weight equal measure 1-2 M
3d, weight equal number
of grains, 2 1-5 44
4th, in quality and value, 3 1-4 44
6th, in weight of straw, 5 44
The "ripe" had the advantage over the
"green" in every respect but that of the
straw, in which the green had an advantage
of 22 percent.
Mr, Hannam estimates the comparative
value of the whole crop on an acre of
each kind aa follows:
Green ?11 11 10
Raw 13 7 3
Ripe 12 17 3
Our readers will judge of these experi.
ments for themselves; but we must add,
there are other considerations of great
weight in favor of cutting wheat before
U is "dead ripe." These, more time for
focuring the crop ; less waste in harvesting
from the shelling of the grain ; and
a better quality of straw, a thing of no
small consequence where it is us cjtgti.
I sively used for feeding stock, as in our
wheat growing districts. It is also the
opinion of millers, we believe universally,
that early cut grain makes far better
flour than that which becomes fully ripe
before cutting. It is probable the same
facts would hold good of barley, rye, oats,
&c., and it would seem desirable that
farmers should ascertain these points, as
small profits, or small losses, in the aggregate,
are the things that make, or ruin,
the.cultivator of the soil.
I There is a great waste by many in har|
vesting grain from using bed implements,
' not paying attention to putting it up propl

all parts of the work in a slovenly and
unfarmerlike manner. There is a vast
deal of wheat and other grain, put into
the barn or stack after rains, or before the
straw or green matters the sheaves may
contain are cured, in such a state that
the central parts of the sheaf heat, mold
and become nearly rotten. The result
is bad wheat, musty and poor flour, all
which might be avoided by care in the
several processes through which the crop
passes.

IMPROVING LAND WITH OATS.
Science Grove^ Davidson Co, N, C, )
July 23, 1841. $
Mr. Editor?An extract quoted in No.
7 of the Farmer's Advocate, has called
forth this communication, as a verification
of the principle there held forth: the
application of oats as a paramount and vital
restorative of the soil, where it ha9
received the matricidal poinard of the
land killer to its heart; enabling it, phce- 1
nix like, to spring forth in virgin beauty,
even from the ashes of its own destruction.
Clover has long been celebrated for its
fertilizing properties. Oats has not, as
yet, had such strong recommendation in
its favor; yet nevertheless I think when
its properties, as such, have become sufficiently
known, and tested^ if it does not <
gain an equal footing, it will become a ;
vice-clover, as a renovator of the soil. I
will state my theory and support it with I
an experiment, and leave the reader to t
draw his own inference. \
, :..g-^ap^yOUr (
oats at tne common urne, miu m mc uau?i
manner, only, sow something like a half '
Sushel more seed to the acre, and after .
they are plowed or harrowed in as the
case may he, roll the ground with a light
roller. Let it stand until about two ;
thirds of the grain in the head is ripe. ,
Then roll it down, and double plow it ,
under, taking care that the point of the
gouge reaches ten inches below the sur- i
face*. Roll the ground as before. (Not
that I think that after rolling benefits further
than this,?it renders the surface in a
situation for all the oats to be rolled
down when required. I suppose it further
renders service, by keeping the elevated
ridges left by the plow from excessive
evaporation.) Let it lay until about
two weeks before you wish to sow your
wheat; t en roll down the oats, and
again double plow them under as before ;
sow your wheat and harrow it in, and I'll
warrant you an advance of at least 100
ner cent on vour wheat crop, independent
I W
of its future benefit; which will doubtless
exceed that of the wheat crop.
I will now relate my experiment.?
About the first of July 1840, I selected
a very elevated point in one of my oat
fields to make an experiment. I measured
off a quarter of an acre and double
plowed the oats under, and let it remain
until two weeks before to sow my wheat.
1 then double plowed the young sward of
oats under, and harrowed my wheat in.?
The rest of the field I fallowed by double
plowing, and put it in at the same time I
did the oat patch, (for so I termed my ex.
perimental piece.) At harvest 1 cradled
the experiment piece to itself, and also, a
- - - a *
quarter of an acre lying by the siae or ir,
to test the experiment; off the oat patch,
I saved 13 dozen of wheat, which would
average 3 bushels to the 100 sheaves; and
off the test quarter 1 saved 7 doz. which
would not make more than 2 3-4 bushels
to the 100; making an advance of 100
per cent, on the experimental piece. A
profit not to be spurned at. Unavoida
ble circumstances prevented me from
threshing it out seperately and testing the
experiment by a non tlobums rule, though
I have not an earthly doubt, that if it had
been tested by threshing, it would have
increased the assumed advance in fuvor of
the oat system.
The system appears excellent in every
point of view for a wheat crop; the
wheat is sown in the first stratum of man.

which furnish an abuundant store of nu.

ble matter as the first does to the upper
class; and preserves the crop as secure
against drought, as though it received the
benefit of the Egyptian reservoirs of the
Nile. But gentle reader make the experument
if ye list, for yourself, and then at
leisure draw your own inference, If I have
suggested a plan, whereby you at a future
day, may with pleasure look over your
renovated fields and luxuriant crops, I
have then gained the summit of my
wishes, and the most lofty eminence of
my ambition.

PKICESOP SHORT HORiri'.D DURHAXI.
It has been predicted for many years,
that the time would come when the
solendid, large, square, short horned Durhams
would not sell for more than the
common scrubs of the country ; hut the
day has not yet arrived, and never will. The
Durham? are infinitely more valuable f
beef and milk than any scrubs we have
seen, and why it should to thought they
should command no higher prices, is unaccountably
strange. It is true, the derangements
in money matters has caused
a decrease in the price of every thing,
and of course cattle of all kinds have fallen
with the balance of property. However,
there have been some respectable
sales the present year in this vicinity.
Mr. Wait sold a sucking calf this spring
for $300, a two year old heifer for $425,
and a three year old heifer for $460.
Mixed bloods and inferior Durham?,
would not command those price?. In
England, where the best cattle are produced,
the prices are much better than in
this country* The English know the value
of good stock, as the public sales will
testify. In the Mark Lane Express of
May 10th. published in London, there is
an account of a 44 splendid sale of Short
Horns" by Mr. Wetherell, the property
of Mr. Robinson, wHich shows what estimate
the English put upon fine stock.
14 Taglioni," a cow five years old, brought
200 guineas; calculating a guineas at
five dollars of our currency, the amount
would be one thousand dollars. 44 Malibran,"
a single cow, sold for three hundred
guineas, or about $1500, and for her
young bull calf 100 guineas were refused.
Gremima brought 190 gs. ; Peeros, 65
55 guineas; Nonesuch 65 guineas. dec."
The principal purchasers were?Lord
Huniingfield, W. G. Hayter Esq., J. W.
Etagge, Esq., and T. A. Green, Esq.
rhe prices show that it is scarcely probable
many animals will be imported into
tie United States soon,and it is sufficient
argument to show, that the ft.rmers of
this country shonld use every exertion to
rear the best stock. There are indeed
riany arguments for Tennesceaos to turn
their attention to stock farming. Cotton
has measurably failed, and as for tobacco,
it is morally wrong to encourage it; it
will exhaust much of our iand, and what
is still worse, it is by no means probable
labor will be repaid for cultivating it.
iHost herbage plants flourish finely in
Tenncsee, and we can always find a cer'
0
rain market for what stock would produce.
We do not expect to live to see
rhe day when the best of animals will not
bring good prices for breeders alone.
When me speak of breeders, we do not
mean every animal should be turned out
for this purpose. The best alone should
be used. The noble Durhams have always
been much injured, by turning out
good, bad, and indifferent for breeders ;
when in fact, if out of 20 bull calves, we
ind one which will barely do to keep, we
ire lucky. The Berkshire hogs will soon
oe much injured by turning out every
thing as a breeder. The English have
succeeded better than all the world, in
selecting the best for breeders and keeping
them well, and we must follow the
examnle. to cret the character of scientific
I ? o # ,
breeders. In addition to rearing for
breeders, we should make at least, butter
cheese, and beef for home consumption,
which we have never done, and then we
should have something to send to our
southern friends, vho will never produce
their own eatables. These facta clearly
evince to us, that this must be a farming,
not a planting country, and that good
stock will always bring fair price. We
| think the farmer who now has first-rate
breeders, of either cattle, sheep, or bogs,
would act foolishly to sell them at reduced
prices, and we as firmly believe it would
I be very unwise for the fatmer who has indifferent
scrub s;ock, to refuse selling at
i any price, when he has an offer.

English or flat turnep, to destinguish it,
from the Swedish or ruta bago, is a valuable
root, and better adapted to the table
than any other turnep, and is consequently
deserving a place on every farm.-?
There are many varieties, of which the
Norfolk and Globe are as productive as
any. while some of the smaller kinds, among
which the long turnep holds a prominent
place, are best for cooking. The
soil best calculated for the turnep is a rich
mould abounding injmatter, and newly
cleared lands arc found admirably adapted
to their growth, the soil being usually
i *'
free from weals, and (he ashes made by
burning being one of the best dressings
that can be applied to turneps. Where
such lands ate not to be had, old grass
land carefully turned over and rolled, and
then the surface inade fine by repeated
harrowiags, for the reception of the seed,
are found to produce good turneps. If
the soil is not rich, good compost manure
should be spread on the surface and bar*
roared in, but as old grass lands in richness
partake somewliat of the quality of new
toils, manuring is rarely necessary, and in
the decaying sward the vigorous tap root
of the turnep finds ample nourishment.
Turneps may be sown broadcast or
dftlled, the latter being the preferable
way ;?|id if a little bone dust or poudrette
ia drilled 'in with the seed, the nlants
start more vigorously, and are sooner out
of the way of their most formidable ene.
my, the fly. There is usually far more
seed sown than is necessary, if equally
distributed, and to facilitate this mixing
the seed with ashes or sand is practised
by many farmers. English writers state
the quantity of seed required per acre at
two pounds* but we know by experience
that one-half this quantity of good seed on
proper toil is better than the whole, and
were the distribution perfect, one.fourth
this quantity or half a pound would fully
seed an acre. It is better,however, to err on
the safe side, and sow too much, rather
than too little seed, as if too thick the
young plants may be hoed or pulled out.
The proper time of sowiog will of course,
vary with the lattitude. In New.York,
the besi; time has been found to be from
the 20th to the 27th of July ; in the middle
and southern parts of Pennsylvania,
from the last of July to the middle of Au.
gust; and in Verginia, from the middle
to the last of August is preferred.
The turnep, when grown on land
long cultivated, is apt to have the bulb attacked
by the worm, but in virgin soils,
or those rarely subjected to cultivation,
this eviil does not attend them. Dressings
of soot and ashes have been found
useful when they are attacked by the fly,
and in any event such dressings operate .
favorably on the plant and may therefore '
be beneficially employed when there is
the leant reason to apprehend danger.

THE PEACH?IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT, j
Messrs. Gaylord & Tucker.-?In the
wrote, to Judge Buel.
the Peach Tree with SaltPetre, and pio.
posed to give the result through the medium
of the Cultivator to the public. I
? ranii0?t thlt
ga.ve as my rcawm iui mat iU^vv..,
as far as my observation extended, I had
always observed that on soils containing
nitre and muriatic of soda, the Peach tree
lives luxuriantly to an advanced age,
while upon soils immediately adjoining,
immature decay takes place, and the tree
seldom attains the age of seven years.?
As instancesjin vindication of this occuring
so frequently, I have been astonished to
see tbem passed ever without notice, and
now advert to some of them to establish
the truth of this position. Peach trees
growing in the site where once stood a
dwelling, generally live to an old age, the
soil of which, by analysis, will give a pro*
portion of nitre. The same thing occurs
in many districts of the West and South
West; upon one farm the occupant has no
difficulty in having good peaches, while
I his neighbor finds it a laborious task to
prolong the life of the tree to a few years,
and on ^ell cultivated farms near the
seaboard, I have been informed, they
have but little difficulty in growing this
tree. Having these and other instances
for my guidance, I commenced experiments
with salt and sa'*oetre, in the year
1836, upon an orchard six years old; clo.
ver was sowed upon it that spring, and it
remained in grass till last fall, when it
was nloughed and sown wheat, and clover
this spring. The trees in '36 were full
of worms ; some of the trees were dead,
others apparently dying, and but very
few put on the appearance ofhealth; such
was its distempered condition that some
of my friends advised me to cut down about
one-half of these that yet showed
life, saying that such was the practice of
Peach growers. I thought it would be a
had practice for a physician to destroy
one or more of a family to prevent disease
from spreading, and after cutting down
those that were dead, I commenced operations
on the balance with equal quantities
of salt and salt petre combined, applying
about a half a pound upon the surface
and in contact with the trunk of the tree;
then sowed it broadcast over part of the
orchard, at the rate of about two bushels
per acre. The result of this application
to the surprise of my friends, was the appearanc
of perfect health, white new and
vigorous shoots, the trees full of fruit,
which matured with increased size and
improved flavor. Towards the last of
March, and again in May and September,
1837,1 applied the same ingredients in
different proportions without observing
much difference in the effect; though I
have since thought that where I applied
the salt Detre alone, and where the largest
r
portion of the mixture w as nitre, the effect
was best; but in consequence of the price
of salt petre, I have endeavored to ascertain
the smallest quantity that should be
used, nnd I would not advise less than
one-eighth, though I should prefer onefourth,
or more. My trees this fall (1837,}
i -*/' ? ; V ? :
i
were free from worms, all doing wel!v and I
have found no further use for the axe in
the orchard. In the year 1838,1 applied
the mixtnre to a part of my orchard in
March, the other part received the appli
cation in June and September ; upon that
part done in March, I had an abundance
of fruit, while those done in the 6th and
8th months were comparatively destitute
of fruit, it having been killed by a late
frost. It occured to me that I was indeb.
ted to the salt, &c., for the abundance of
fruit on the trees done in March, by its
retarding vegetation : and from an experiment
made in '77, it appeared to be the
case, though I have never considered it
of sufficient importance to repeat it for the
purpose of testing it further.
In regard to the best time to make this
application, I would say about the 6rst of
April, and to those trees having worms
* * r% . I
in them again in June or sepiemoer, as
the appearance of the worm may indicate
its necessity, using about two-thirds of
the usual quantity for the June or Sep*
tember dressing) and to be used only in
contact with the trunk of the tree. 1
have not discovered any great benefit
from sowing it broadcast over the orchard
every year; I prefer to do this every sec.
ond or third year. If the tree is injured
very much by the worm, to wash the bark
of the trunk with a solution of this mix<
| ture, and water might be of service, be.
[ ing careful not to apply too much ; thii
should not prevent its application in pow<
dered state. To my trees planted in the
fall and spring, I apply as soon as don<
planting in the spring about one ounci
upon the surface, in contact with tin
trunk of the tree, and repeat this quantity
again early in June or September. th<
Peach worm at these two last periods,be
ing in their infancy, are destroyed*1
In August, after one application ofthi
mixture to my young trees in the spring
I havo taken several worms from off tb
outr bark of a tree, bedded in gum, the)
have punctured it in a number of places
but did not penetrate to do any injur;
to the inner bark, whi le the next tree lei
without the above mixture was nearly des
troved, the inner bank being eaten fo
more than two-thirds around the tree. I
might be supposed that the salt and sal
petre would produce instantaneous death
but this is not the case ; I have kept then
half covered in a solution of salt and wa
ter, and salt petre and water, and in thesi
two articles combined for several hour
its approach, and will not remain ft it uii

I find upon this occasion a bill present,
ed to my consideration, based upon rare,
nue principles, which, if it becomes e lew,
will operate with as much equality
throughout the Union as almost any tariff
that can he devised, and which, upon its

i. promise act, which provides that no more
A money shall be raised from customs than
