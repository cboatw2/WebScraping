When the morning lun thW* brightly
Glancing o’er the flowery lea,
And the *oft breeze, einging lightly,

When night’s genial tears are rising,
Like sweet incense to the sky,
And the lowly lark, uprising,
Thrills his melody on high;
Seek the green-roofed bower, and there
Lift the soul in fervent prayer!
When the noontide fervor, glowing, •

And no light-winged zephyr, blowing,
Stirs the calm lake’s glassy breast;
;« Where the storm-voic’d cat’raet, roaring,
Flings his white foam down the dell,
Or the silvery streamlet, pouring
Music soft as Peri’s shell:
Seek the cooling shade, and there
Bend the knee in silent prayer!
When the star of eve; declining,
Rests on the horizon’s verge,
And the moon’s pale glory, shining,
Gilds the ocean’s foaming surge;
When o’er dell, and fount, and flower,
Night has spread her misty veil, -
And no voice sings in the bower,
Save the pensive nightingale;
’Neath the star-lamps bright and fair,
Bow the wayward heart in prayer 1
Though the deepening clouds of sorrow
* Frown above our aching heads,
And upon the coming morrow
Hope no cheering radiance sheds;
When our cherished flowers are withering,
And joy’s parting knell has rang,
While the crush’d heart’s folds are quivering

Still, ’mid grief, and gloom, and care,
Pour the anguish’d soul in prayer 1

Catherine Miller was born in Newberry Dis
trict, in this State, on the 30th July, 1757; in early
life removed to this city, where she remained until
her death, which took place on the 9th of October
1843, aged eighty-six years two months and nine
days. In the year 1811, Bhe was awakened to a
sense of her lost condition by nature, under the
preaching of the Rev. Dr. William Capers, and in
the same year joined the Methodist Episcopal
Church. She professed to have been converted on
the 26th December, 1811. Since then she has
ever remained a constant and worthy member of
the Church. Her chief delight was always to be
found in the assembly of the saints, and it was only
until a very late period of life, when the infirmities
of age pressed upon her, that her seat in the house
of God was vacated. It was her practice, from the
time of her conversion to a very late period of her
life, either to fast or abstain every Friday. She
greatly delighted to read or have the Scriptures
read to her, but particularly the 91st Psalm.. In
fact, religion appeared to have been her constant
theme, and to serve the Lord faithfully her chief
desire. A short time previous to her death, from
the growing infirmities of age, her mind had be
come so enfeebled that she did not recognize those
of her own family who ministered to her; not
withstanding this, the name of Jesus was ever pre
cious to her. A few days previous to her death,
when one of the ministers of God was in atten
dance at her bed-side, and she seemed to be sinking
gently into the arms of death, she roused up, and he
asked her if Jesus was precious. She said “ yes,”
he said to her, “ the Lord is good,” she repeated “ the
Lord is good,” and pressed his hand as if she fully
understood the meaning of his words. Theso were
the last words that she spoke, showing clearly that
although her heart and flesh were failing, she still
trusted in the Lord. There were several verees
of hymns that she delighted greatly to repeat, and
the strong emphasis that she would place on some
of the lines, showed how fully she felt their im
importance; such as
* How happy every child, of grace
Who knows his sins forgiven,
This earth he cries is not my place;
1 seek my place in Heaven."
Thus she descended to the grave, as a shock of
corn fully ripe for the garner, and we have no
doubt that she fully realized the truth of those
words, she frequently repeated,
“ I want to see my Saviour near,
When soul and body’s parting.”

Our beloved brother, the Rev. Daniel M’Don
ald, has been removed by death, in the prime of
life, when his usefulness seemed to be increasing
daily. An affectionate wife and four small chil
dren, were dependant on him for support; but alas,
thsir circumstances forbade not the approach of the
dread messenger: after an illness of some eight
days, he fell a victim to that fatal fever known in
our country as congestive. Brother M’Donald
was born in Elbert Co., Georgia, in the year 1806.
His father and mother early dedicated him to God :
and in the year 1834, they realized the answer of
prayer in his conversion. He soon manifested a
desire to preach the gospel; and after a sufficient
trial he was licensed; and in the year 1828, he
was received in the South Carolina Conference on
trial. In the division of this Conference he was
thrown into the Georgia Conference. Here he
remained until 1831, a. which time he was trans
fered to the Alabama Conference, where he con
tinued to travel until 1835. At the close of this
year, finding himself surrounded by circumstances
over which he had no control, he thought best to
locate. Having married the year previous he set
tled a small farm in the vicinity of Jackson, Clarke
County, Alabama, where he led a quiet and peace
able life. His time was principally occupied in
attending to the domestic concerns of life, until he
was overtaken by the hand of death. He ever re
mained firmly attached to the Methodist Episcopal
Church, although there were some circumstances
in connection with his history, that were well cal
culated to try the depth of his faith. It will please
his own and the friends of Zion every where, to
learn that his end was peace. In his last moments
he dung a part of that triumphant Hymn in our
book, that begin; .with this glorious sentiment:
11 Our Saviour’s pierced side,
1 Poured out a double flood ;
Bj Water we are purified,
And pardoned by hie blood." etc.
And when his tongue had grown almost too stiff
for utterance, he was heard to whisper, “ O how
sweet ia the redemption of Jesus.” Although his
wife and little onee weep with a bitterness that is
not to be misunderstood, yet they mourn not as
those that have no hope. The precise date of his
death is not recollected. Thos. Killouqh.

Our dear sister, Mrs. Margaret Rawlins,
died at her residence in Burke county, Ga^ on the
18th of September, in the 63d year of age. In her
early days, before her marriage, she became a
member of the Methodist E. Church, the doctrines
and discipline of which she loved and adorned to
the day of her death. Being a Methodist in senti
ment and feeling, and possessing a heart that over
flowed with kindness, the toil-worn minister of
Jesus ever found in her a faithful friend, aye, a
mother, who felt happy to soothe his sorrows and ad
minister to his wants, though the dark night of
widowhood hung heavy upon herself. Those min
isters who have preached at New Prospect Church,
on the Jefferson circuit, will remember sister Raw
lins. Many and severe were the afflictions she
suffered while here, and her last illness, though not
very protracted, was exceedingly painful; so much
so, that she seems to have said nothing, or very
little, about her prospects for eternity: but if “ the
righteous hath hope in his death,”-if “ the righteous
shall be in everlasting remembrance,” then doubt
less our beloved sister rests in peace. The house
where she dwelt stands lonely and with closed
door, a mournful spectacle to her children as they
pass. The silence thatreigns there isonly broken by |
the bark of the poor watch-dog thatstill lingers about
the former dwelling of his mistress. But let no
useless tears be shed,—let no melancholy reflec
tions be indulged,—she sleeps in. Jesus. It was
my happy lot, several times previous to her death, to
examine her in class-meeting, and every time I
found her on the wing for glory: indeed I do not re
member ever having seen her at church, (our ac-1
quaintance was short,) when she did not seem to
get a blessing. No proud mausoleum marks her
last resting-place, to herald the deeds of her life;
but her “record is on high,” the solemn pines
stand sentinel around, and the winds of heaven
chant mournfully her funeral dirge ; but
“ God her Redeemer lives,
And ever from the skies I
Looks down and watches all her dust,
Till He shall bid it rise.”

Died, of Congestive Fever, September 10,1843, j
in Lancaster District, S. C., Dr. John Osburn
Heath, in the twenty-third year of his age.
Dr. Heath, was born, and brought up in Chester
District. Trained by religious parents, he early
saw the necessity of a change of heart; and
sought and obtained regenerating grace in his
seventeenth year, at Ebenezer camp-ground. About
this time, he attaced himself to the Methodist E.
Church; of which he continued a faithful and
consistent member until his heath. His dying
exercises were peculiary solemn. When his case
was pronounced hopeless, he called his father, then
his wife, and other friends present, and requested
them all to meet him in Heaven. He then asked
his father to pray; which done, his father asked
him whether his faith was still strong! to which
he unhesitatingly answered; “ yes, it is.” He
bid his weeping wife an affectionate farewell; sent
words of comfort to brothers and sisters, and a re
quest for all to meet him in Heaven. Soon after
which he fell asleep in Jesus.
The community has lost in Dr. Heath a good
citizen; his parents, a dutiful son, his brothers and
sisters a faithful brother, his wife an affection
ate husband, and the church a valuable member.
He possessed in a very eminent degree, both as to
his head and heart, the respect of all men in the
circle of acquaintances among whom he moved. I
have never known or heard of the slightest stain
upon his principles or conduct. But he is gone,
and well may we exclaim,
“Yes the Christian’s course is run;
Ended is the glorious strife,
Fought the fight, the work is done,
Death is swallowed up of life.”

Died, on the 7th September, 1843, in Laurens
County, Ga., the Rev. Daniel Bird, of the Georgia
Conference. Brother Bird was born January 29th,
1803, and in August 1820, sought and found justi
fying grace through faith in Christ Jesus, and at
tached himself to the Methodist Episcopal Church.
From that time up to August 1832, his life was
uniform as a Christian, and part of that time he
served the church as a faithful leader and exhorter,
and was known as a man of much prayer and great
faith. In August 1832, he was licensed to preach;
in 1834 joined the itinerancy; was ordained dea
con January 17lh, 1836, and ordained elder 10th
December, 1837. In all these offices he strictly
and faithfully attended to his official duties, labour
ing to be found accepted of God, who had called
him to this work and ministry. He took the fever
in August, which in fifteen days terminated his life
and labours. His dying testimony was, as that of
his life had been, distinctly in favour of the value
and comfort of the grace of Christ Jesus. He
spoke of his willingness to depart; said that no
cloud covered his prospect in eternity ; and rejoiced
in the hope of the resurrection of the dead, and
the life everlasting of the world to come.

THE PLAGUE AT LONDON.
A SKETCH.
During the reign of Charles II. a sad and
fearful calamity occurred at London. Whilst
the city presented a scene of revelry and mirth_
when all persons, from the monarch to his mean
est subject, indulged in licentiousness nnd crime
—a plague (that direful disaster of populous
cities,) broke out among them.
Charles and his courtiers fled from the icy
hand of the “ fell destroyer" who ruled as “ king
of terrors," and seemed to rejoice in his authori
ty ; for in a short time many rebellious subjects
had bowed submissively to his iron sceptre. He
spared neither age, sex, nor condition. The
lick, when seated amidst their treasures, whilst |
the wine-cup was passing merrily around, were
seized without a warning; the poor were dragg
ed from their hovels in rags. A family were
seated at their morning meal, the pestilence
came among them, and they separated never to
meet again. Fathers fled from their helpless
children, leaving them to starve; even mothers
tore their infected babes from their bosom* and
dashed them away. All ties of society were
broken, and each one sought for life. The few
who clung together amid these trying scenes
were soon for victims of the “man whose bones
are maTrowless,” and they rapidly followed each
other, until none were left to mourn the fate of
their companions.
The hum of business was no longer heard ;
all commerce had ceased ;
“ Ships sailorless lay rolling on the deep.
And their masts fell down piecemeal I"
Theatres, ball-rooms, and other places of amuse
ment, were closed—being deserted by their vo
taries. The churches had opened wide their
doors, to entice the dying people within their
solemn precincts ; but none would enter there,
for each man feared his fellow, so that the pious
priests alone moved in silence about the shrines.
A gloomy terror overspread every countenance,
ana the very brutes seemed to participate in the
feelings of tne human breast.
Before this pestilence had spread over the
land, but when its victims were few, the solemn
trains of weeping mourners were seen winding
their way with slow and silent tread through the
city ; but soon deaths became so very numerous,
that this lastsad rite was neglected. A pit was
dug without the city, into which the dead were
thrown, when night threw her dark mantle over
the realm.
“ See what a motly and incongruous heap,
In undistinguished fellowship, are here:
The head which once a proud tiara wore,
Unconscious, rests upon a ploughman’s cheek,
And that which, animate, promulged the law,
Serves as a pillow for a felon’s skull.
Huge limbs, that once with sinews strong were braced,
And arms gigantic, that, encas’d in steel.
Wielded the sword, and raised the massive shield,
Now rest in quiet with a stripling’s limbs,
Or relics sad of beauty’s fragile form:
And where’s the difference now 1
Rank, honors, fortune, strength herculean,
Fame, birthright, beauty, valor or renown,
What trace is left ofye 1”

whilst grass and weeds grew abundantly on the
sidewalks, where occasionally might be seen a
ghastly form, hastening along with quick and
hurried steps.
When darkness, (the appropriate garb of this
time of gloom,) closed the scene, a number of
men would drive their carts through the city to
bear to the loathsome pit, the bodies of such as
had perished by the poisonous air ; and many a
corse was borne to its last resting-place amid the
curses of those unfeeling wretches, whose oaths
formed its only funeral dirge.
What were the feelings of the infected wretch,
when he heard the bell of these death-carts, and
the dismal cry of their drivers re-echo through
the silent night ? 1 Tis at any time a fearful thing
to die—to feel your senses fell—your body droop
and decay; but to die alone, forsaken and. forgot
ten by those you love—to have none to watch
over you, to cool your parched lips with the re
freshing draught, and to mark your exit into the
unknown future, is more fearful still; to know
that yourself once so loved and esteemed, around
whom a numerous circle offriends have gather
ed, will scon become a hideous, loathsome lump
of clay, on which the worm will fatten, while it
revels in its horrid repast. Such was the lot of
many. The rumbling carts reminded them,
that one and another of their fellow mortals were
going to their last abode, and the cry of—
“ Bring out your dead,” fell as a denth-knell on
startled ears ;—for they might be the next occu
pants of these very carts. |
When the pestilence left the land, there was
scarcely a family circle which it had not broken,
and made to mourn over lost hopes, and to sigh
for relatives cruelly torn away.
FENELON.
Though Fenclon was under a aloud, both in
respect to ecclesiastical and court favor, yet his
irreproachable life so commended itself to the
moral sense of mankind, as to draw involuntary
homage from all with whom he came in contact.
During a war with England, when his diocese
was exposed to the course of the army, Prince
Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough, both
gave orders to respect everything that belonged
to the Archbishop. English sentinels watched
at the doors of his palace, and repeated offers of
foreign soldiers were made to guard him from
one part of his diocese to another. It is related
that at this time, Fenelon, in the course of one of
his visits, met a poor cottager, overwhelmed
with distress, and inquired the cause—“Ah!
my lord,” answered the poor man, “the soldiers
have driven away my cow, and I know not
where I shall ever find another as good.”—
Availing himself of the safe-condact that had
been given him, Fenelon set out on foot, a dis
tance of some miles, recovered the aow, and
drove her back to the grateful cottager. This
tenderness for the poor and low, was the more
remarkable at an age when high ecclesiastics
exhibited all the pomp and haughtiness of the
nobility : and seemed to think that a measure
less distance divided them from the common peo
ple. Fenelon’s visits to his flock were common
ly made on foot, and without attendants ; he en
tered their families as a sympathising friend, and
shared their intorests, joys, aud sorrows, with all
the tenderness of a parent. While he maintain
ed m his palace the state and dignity required of
his high rank, he, nevertheless, seemed to con
sider his fortune an enjoyment, only so far as it
enabled him to confer happiness, and alleviate
distress. The poor, the sick, the friendless, the
wounded among the soldiers, were received into
his house, and there found tenderness, sympathy,
and care. It is related of him, that in one of his
absences from his diocese, he heard that his
palace, his library, and papers, had been con
sumed by fire. “ I would rather that they had
been burned,” replied Fenelon, “than the cot
tage of a poor peasant.” Another anecdote re
lated of Fenelon, bears testimony to the effect of
his daily life on those around him. Some of his
ecclesiastical opponents, anxious to have some
thing to report against him, contrived to intro
duce into his family a man who was to be a spy
upon his actions. Subdued, however, by the
Eurity and gentleness that he witnessed, he threw
imself at the feet of Fenelon, and confessed the
unworthy design that he had cherished, and ever
after remained one of his firmest friends. “ I
must not stay here,” said Lord Peterborough—
an avowed infidel—who was visiting at Cam
brai, “if I remain here two days longer, Fenelon
will make a Christian of me in spite of myself”
The last part of the life ofthis good man was
embittered by many afflictions. Cut off by his
vows of celibacy from all the supports of family
affection, his deep spirit clung with the more
absorbing love to his intimate and personal
friends. The sudden death of the royal pupil,
whose mind he had formed, and from whose
reign he hoped so much good to France, was to
him an overwhelming stroke. To this, soon
after sueewsded the death of the Duke of Dent
villiers, his longest tried and dearest friend. On
hearing of this last affliction, he exclaimed, in a
burst of sorrow—“All my tics are broken.”—
After this, he seemed to gird up the loins of his
mind, and to stand waiting for the hour of his
dismissal. An accident at last accelerated the
approach of death—and the noble and lo vely
spirit passed into everlasting rest. At the time
of his death, as he was still understood to be un
der the cloud of royal displeasure, no one ap
peared to pronounce a funeral oration over his
remains—a customary honor at that time ren
dered to distinguished men. But the ceremony
was needless, for the record of Fenelon’s worth
was engraven deep in the hearts and consciences
of all who had ever known him. Eight months
after, the monarch, whose frown had kept
France in awe, also died—“and was buried;”
the funeral ceremonies were interrupted by the
rejoicings of the people, who, having flattered,
feared, and hated him while living, exulted over
him when dead. “The name of the just isos
brightness; but the memory of the wicked shall
rot.”
4 'Twelve reasons for paying
YOUR DEBTS.
the Christian’s reasons.
1. The Christian member of society pays his
debts, first, because he is ordered to do so in the
Bible, where we are told to “Render unto
Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God
the things that are God’s;” and to “ Owe no man
any thing.”
2. The Christian hears the Eighth Command
ment every Sunday/* Thou shalt not stealand
defrauding a man of his due is stealing; for the
tradesman lends upon faith and honor, and does
not give.
3. The Christian pays reguarly all he owes,
because he is a friend to justice and mercy; he
wishes both to love and succor his neighbor, and
will not have the ruin of others on his con
science.
the patriot’s reasons.
4. The patriot knows that one act of Justice
is worth six of charity—that justice helps the
worthy and corrects the unworthy, while charity
too often succors but the latter.
5. The patriot considers the evils that ensue
from the more wealthy man leaving his poorer
neighbor unpaid; that by that means the steps of
the great ladder of society are broken ; the first
ruin beginning with the merchant, who can no
longer pay his workmen, and continuing to the
workman’s child, who is deprived of clothes,
food, or instruction; or to tne aged father or
mother, left to die on a bed of straw.
6. The patriot pays his debts from a love of
his country; knowing that the neglect of so
doing brings on Agrarianism, Chartism, and a
hatred of the upper ranks.
7. The patriot also pays, because the system
of non-payment, pursued! to a certain extent,
would bring a general bankruptcy on the nation,
THE MAN OF THE WORLD’S REASONS FOR PATINO
HIS DEBTS.’
8. The man of the world pays, because he is
convinced that honesty is the best of policy.
9. The man of tne world pays, because he
knows that curses will go with his name, if he
does not pay, instead of good will and good words,
which last he secures with a certain class by pay
ing.
10. The man of worldly calculation is aware,
that by the immediate payment of his debts, as
fast as they are incurred, he purchases peace of
mind, and becomes acquainted with his income,
his means, and resources.
11. The man of the world wishes for a com
fortable old age, and knows that he has but little
chance of it from his surrounding family, unless
he trains up his children in habits of order and
economy.
12. The man of the world knows the full
force of the term “ being an honest man,"—that
it will carry him through political dimiles and
family disputes ; and he cannot make claim to
that name if he is the ruin of others.
The crying sin of either international or
thoughtless debt in an heretofore honest nation,
is a disgrace to the very name of England or
Englishmen, and demands a remedy from a
thinking and enlightened public.—London Spec
tator.
ENGLISH TAXATION.
Sidney Smith, the reverend gentleman whose
memorial to Congress on the subject of statestocks
appeared not long ago, was one of the founders
of the Edinburgh Review. His early contribu
tions to that celebrated journal were distinguished
by the wit and humor which have not ceased to
characterise his writings yet. The following
graphic sketch of English taxation in its details
has been quoted before now, but it will bear
quotation again:
“We can inform Jonathan what are the inevita
ble consequences of being too fond of glory—
taxes upon every article which enters into the
mouth, or covers the back, or is placed under the
foot—taxes upon every thing which is plesantto
see, hear,feel,smell ortaste—taxes upon warmth,
light, and loeomotion,—taxes on every thing on
earth, and the waters under the earth,—on every
thing that comes from abroad, or is grown at
home—taxes on the raw material—taxes on every
fresh value that is added to it by the industry of
man—taxes on the cause which pampers man’s
appetite, and the drug that restores him to health
—on the ermine which decorates the judge, and
the rope which hangs the criminal—on the poor
man’s salt, and the rich man’s spice—on the brass
nails of the coffin, and the ribbands of the bride—
at bed or board, couchant or levant, we must pay.
The school-boy whips his taxed top; the beard
less youth manages his taxed horse, with a taxed
bridle, on a taxed road ; and the dying English
man pours his medicine, which has paid seven
per cent., into a spoon that has paid fifteen per
cent.; flings himself back upon his chintz bed,
which has paid twenty-two per cent.; and expires
in the arms of his apothecary, who has paid a
license of a hundred pounds for the privilege of
putting him to death. His whole property is
then immediately taxed from two to ten per cent.
Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for
burying him in the chancel, his virtues are han
ded down to posterity on taxed marble; and he
is then gathered to his fathers, to be taxed no
more.”
HEARING AND DOING.
The Rev. Mr. Erskine mentions a iact which
may afford a very useful hint to every hearer of
the gospel. A person who had been to public
worship, having returned home, perhaps some
time sooner than usual, was asked, “Is all done?”
“ No !" replied he, “ all is said, but all is not
done!” How little is commonly done of all that
is heard 1 “Blessed are they that hear the
word of God and keep it.”
TEMPERANCE.
T1IE RAVAGES OF INTEMPERANCE.
BY EDWARD EVERETT.
In a word, sir, when we contemplate intemper
ance in all its bearings and effects on the condition
hid character <rf men, I believe we shall atftna
!o the conclusion that it is the greatest evil which,
is beings of a componnd nature, we have to fear,
;he greatest, because striking directly at the ulti
mate principle of the constitution of man. Let
us contemplate this thought for a moment, for
within it is contemplated, if I mistake not, the
whole philosophy on this subject. Our life exists
in a mysterious union of the corporal and intellec
tual principles, an alliance of singular intimacy,
as well as of strange contrast, between the two ex
tremes of being. In their due relation to each
other, and in the rightful discharge of their re
spective functions, I do not know whether the
pure essence itself, (at least so far as we can
comprehend it, which is but faintly) ought more
to excite our admiration than this wondrous com
pound of spirit and matter. I do not know that
it is extravagant to say, that there is as signal a
display of divine skill in linking those intellec
tual powers, which are the best image of the
divinity, with the forms and properties of matter,
as in the creation of orders of beings purely
disembodied and spiritual. When I contrast the
dull and senseless clod of the valley, in its un
animated state, with the curious hand, the glow
ing cheek, the beaming eye, the discriminating
sense which dwells in a thousand nerves, I feel
the force of that inspired exclamation, “ I am
fearfully and wonderfully made!" And when
I consider the action and reaction of soul and
body on each other, the impulse given to volition
from the senses, and again to the organs, by the
will,—when I think how thoughts, so exalted,
that, though they comprehend all else, they can
not comprehend th? laws of their own existence,
are yet able to take a shape in the material air,
to issue and travel from one sense in one man, to
another sense in another man, so that as the
words drop from lips, the sacred chambers of the
soul are thrown open, and its invisible ideas
made manifest, I am lost in wonder. If to this
I add the reflection how the world and its affairs
are governed, the face of nature changed, oceans
crossed, continents settled, families of men gath
ered and kept toge'her for generations, and mon
uments of power, wisdom and taste erected,
which last for ages after the hands that reared
them have turned to dust, and all this by the
agency of that fine intellectual principle, which
sits modestly concealed behind its veil of clay,
andmoves its subject organs, I find no words to
express my admiration of that union of mind
and matter,by which these miracles are wrought.
Who can thus contemplate the wonder, the beau
ty, the vast utility,the benevolence, the indescriba
ble fitness of this organization, and not feel that
this vice of intemperance, which aims directly to
destroy it, is the arch-abomination of our natures,
tending not merely to create a conflict between
the nicely adjusted principles, but to assure the
triumph of that which is low, base, sensual and
earthly, over the healthy and pure,—to convert
this so curiously organized frame into a disor
dered, crazy machine, and to drag down the soul
to the slavery of grovelling lusts?
in uie ursi piace mere is a snameiui aouse
of the bounties of Providence, which after ma
king the substantial provision for the supply of
our daily wants,—after spreading out the earth,
with its vegetable stores, as a great table for our
nutriment, and appointing the inferior animals
for our solid food, was pleased as it would seem,
of mere grace and favour, to add unnumbered
cordial spirits to gratify and cheer us, sweet wa
ters and lively spices, to fill the fibres of the cane
with delicious syrups, the clusters of the vine,
with its cooling juices, and a hundred aromatic
leaves, berries and fruits, with their refreshing
and reviving essences; and even to infuse into
the poppy an anodyne against the sharpest pains
our frail flesh is heir to:—I say it is a great ag
gravation of the sin of intemperance, that it sei
zes on all these kind and bountiful provisions,
and turns them into a source, not of comfort and
health, but of excess, indecently reveling at the
banquet of nature, shamefully surfeiting at the
sober table of Providence, ana converting every
thing that has life and power, alike the exhilara
ting and the soothing, the stimulant and opiate,
into accursed poison.
Next come the ravages of this all-destroying
vice on the health of its victims. You see them
resolved, as it were, to anticipate the corruption
of their natures. They think the worm is slow
in his approach, and sluggish at his work. They
wish to reconvert the dust before their hour comes,
into its primitive deformity and pollution. My
friend who spoke before me, (Mr. Pierson) called
it a partial death, by which they drag about with
them, above the grave, a mass of diseased, decay
ing, aching clay. They will not only commit
suicide, but do it in such a way as to be the wit
nesses and conscious victims of the cruel process
of self murder; doing it by degrees, by inch
es; quenching the sight, benumbing the brain,
laying down the arm of industry to be cut off, and
changing a fair, healthy, robust frame, for a
shrinking, suffering, living corpse, with nothing
of vitality but the power of suffering, and with
every thing of death but its peace.
Then follows the wreck of property,—the
great object of human pursuit; thetemporal ruin,
which comes like an avenging angel, to waste
:he substance of the intemperate; which crosses
:heir threshold commissioned, as it were, to
plague them with all the horrors of ruined for
:une and blasted prospects, and passes before their
istonished sight, in the dread array of affairs
perplexed, debts accumulated, substance squan
dered, honor tainted; wife, children cast upon
the mercy of the world, and he who should have
been their guardian and protector, dependent for
his unearned daily bread upon those to whom he
is a burden, and a curse.
But as all this, much as it is, is neither the
greatest nor the worst part of the aggravation of
the crime. It produces consequences of still
more awful moment. It first exasperates the pas
sions, and then takes off from them the restraints
of the reason and will: maddens and then un
chains the tiger, raving for blood; tramples all
the intellectual and moral man under the feet of
the stimulated clay; lays the understanding, the
kind affections, and the conscience, in the same
grave with prosperity and health; and having
killed the body,kills the soul!
LADIES.
THE WIFE. A BEING TO COME
HOME TO.
And after all, what is it that man seeks in the
companionship of woman 1 An influence like
the gentle dew, and the cheering light, more felt
throughout the whole of his existence, in its
softening, healing, harmonizing power; than ac
knowledged by any single act, or recognized by
any certain rule. It is in feet a being to come
home to, in the happiest sense of that expres
sion.
Poetic lays of ancient times were wont to tell
how the bold warrior, returning from the fight,
would dofT his plumed helmet, and reposing from
his toils, lay bare his weary limbs, that woman’s
hand might pour into their wounds the healing
balm. But never wearied knight, nor warrior
covered with the dust of battle field, was more
in need of woman’s soothing power than are
those care-worn sons of toil, who struggle for
(to bread df life) in tfar mdrt jftMfcArl u*l en
lightened days. And still, though the romance
of the castle, the helmet, the waving plume, and
the
** Clarion wild and high,”
may all have vanished from the scene; the charm
of woman’s influence lives as brightly in the
picture of domestic joy, as when she placed the
wreath of victory on the hero’s brow. Nay,
more so; for there are deeper sensibilities at
work, thoughts more profound, and passions
more intense, in our great theatre of intellectual
and moral strife; than where the contest was for
martial fame, and force of arms procured for
each competitor his share of glory, or of
wealth.
Among all the changes which have taken
place in the condition of mankind, it is then not
the least of woman’s privileges, that her influ
ence remains the same, except only as it is
deepened and perfected as her own character ap
proaches towards perfection. It is not the least of
her privileges, that she can still be all to man
which his necessities require; that he can retire
from the tumult of the world, and seek her society
with a zest which nothing can impair, so long as
she receives him with a true and faithful heart—
true to the best and kindest impulses of which
her nature is capable; and faithful to the sacred
trust committed to her care.
And that it is so, how many a home can wit
ness—how many a fireside welcome—how many
a happy meeting after absence painfully prolong
ed! Yes, there are scences within the sacred
precincts of the household hearth, which not the
less, because no stranger’s eye beholds them, re
pay, and richly too, dark days of weary conflict,
and long nights of anxious care. But who shall
paint them? Are they not graven on the hearts
of wives? and those who hold the picture there,
in all its beatuy, vividness, and truth, would
scarcely wish to draw aside the veil, which
screens it from the world—Mrs. Ellis.
CHILDREN.
RESPECT TO OLD AGE.
A TRUE STORY.
A young gentleman fresh from college, who
had more knowledge of books than of men,
was wending his way to the Rev. Dr. C—, of Ct.
The Dr. was extensively known and respected
for his energy of character, his learning and
piety, and moral worth. But like the great
apostle, he did not disdaim to “ labour with his
own hands."
With a letter of introduction to the aged di
vine, whom he had known only by reputation,
our genteel young friend was seeking the privi
lege of an acquaintance with him.
“ Old daddy,” said he to an aged labourer in
the field by the way-side, whose flapped hat and
coarse looking over coat,-(it was a lowering day:
and his dark eomplexion and features, contrasted
strongly with his own broad-cloth and kid gloves
and fair person)—“Old daddy, tell me where the
Rev. Dr. C-lives.” “ In the house you
see yonder,” the old man modestly replied.
Without condescending to thank him for the
information, the young man rode on, and soon
I found himself seated in the parlour of Dr. C.’s
hospitable residence, at the invitation of the lady of
the house, awaiting the expected arrival of the
Doctor.
In due time the host appeared, having return
ed from the field, laid aside his wet garments, and
adjusted his person. But to the surprise and
confusion of the young guest, whom should he
meet in the Reverend Dr. but the same old daddy
he had so unceremoniously accosted on his
way!
“It was very respectful in you,” said the ven
erable divine, with an arch look, and in a pleas
ant tone,—for the aged person was not wanting
in wit and humour,—“ it was very respectful in
you to call me old daddy: I always love to see
young men show respect to old age.”
The confusion ana mortification of the young
man were indescribable. He could have sunk
through the floor, and buried himself in the
darkness of the cellar beneath him. With a
countenance crimsoned with blushes, he began to
stammer out an apology for his incivility.
“No apology,” said the doctor, very pleasant
ly, “no apology,—I always love to see respect
shown to old age.” But the kindness and assi
duity of the family could not relieve the unpleas
antness of his situation ; a sense of the mortify
ing blunder which he had committed, marred all
his anticipated pleasure from the interview, and
! he was glad to take his leave as soon as he could
do it with decency.
This item of his experience was, no doubt, a
valuable lesson to him. And if our young rea
ders will learn from this story, not to judge of a
man’s worth by the dress he has on, it will be a
good lesson to them, and save them from many
mistakes.—Western S. S. Magazine.
THE POOR TRAVELLER.
James was sitting one evening, looking out at
the window, and he saw a man walking along
the road very slowly, with a bundle slung over
his shoulder, on the end of a stick. He seemed
lame and sick.
“Father," said James, “may I ask that poor
man to come into the house and rest, and take a
bowl of bread and milk? He seems quite tired,
and very feeble.”
James’s father willingly gave him leave to do
as he wished; and, after some time, James came
into the parlor, saying that the man was very
thankful for the bread and milk. The man wish
ed, James said, to stay and lodge in the barn, as
he was so much fatigued that he did not feel
able to walk farther.
James’s father went to the room where the
poor man was, and asked him some questions,«
and talked with himawhile; and when he returned
to the parlor, he said to James, “ You may tell
the man, that he may sleep on the bed in the lit
tle room over the woodhouse ; and that if he feels
strong enough to-morrow to do some light work,
I shall be glad to employ him for a day or two,
and pay him money for his labor, so as to help
him on his journey.
James came back with a glad face, saying that
the man wished very much to find work to do,
such as his strength would allow; lor he wanted
very much to get home and see his children
again.
“His home,” continued James, “ is a great way
off; and he needs more money than he has now,
to pay his way home."
' “ Yes,” replied James’s father; “ he was wor
king at a great distance from home, he says,
when he was taken sick, and lay ill for a long '
time, and is not able to do much work yet. But
! he hopes to get home soon, and be able to work
again all day. His family, he fears, may be
suffering, from the want of his aid. Should you '
I like to send something, by him, to his children?"
“ Yes,” said James ; “ he may have my shoes
that are too small for me, if they will do for one
of his children; and he may have one of my
story-books, for them to read; and he may have
that piece of money you gave me last, and buy
what, he thinks best for them."—RmsMi Pri
