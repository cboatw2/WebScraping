Tj?e financial operations of the Government
during the present year have, I am
happy to say, been very successful. " T- e
difficulties under which the Treasury Departnient
has labored from knotvn defects
in the existing laws relative to the safe
k?*epfng of the public moneys,, aggravated
by the suspension of specie payments by
several ol the hanks ho ding public deposits,
or indebted to public officers for notes
received in payment of public dues, have
| been surmounted :o a very gratifying ex.
tent. Tae f rge curr?*nt expenditures have
been punctually met, and the .faith of the
Government in all its pecuniary co ccrus
has been S Tupuously maintained. ,
The nineteen ?n:ll oris of Treasury notes
authorized by, the act ol Congress of 1837,
and Hie modifications thereof, with a view
to the indulgence of men hants on their du
~~ "" O ""
ty bonds, and of the deposite banks in the
payment of public mowys held by them,
havii been so punctually redeemed us to
leave loss li in the original ten millions outstanding
a: any one time, and the wnole
amount unredeemed now falls short of throe
millions. Of these the chief portion is not
due till next year, and the whole would
have been already extinguished could the
Treasury have realized the payments due
to it from the banks. If those due from
them next year shall be punctually made,
and if Congress shall keep the appropriations
within the estimates, there is every
reason to believe that all the outstanding
Treasury notes can be redeemed, and the
ordinary expenses defrayed, without impossing
on the people any additional burden,
eitherol lonis, or increased taxes.
To avoi' this, and to keep the cxpendi-,
tures within roosonahie bounds, is a duty, socon
J only in importance to the preservation of
our nation*! character, and the protection
ufour citizens in their civil and pol tic.al
rights. The creation, ui time of p- aee, of "
debt likely 10 become permanent, is an evl
f ?r which there is no equivalent. The
rapidity will which many of th : States are
apparently approaching to this conditi o, ad
monishes us of our own du ie.s, in ? manner
100 impress ve to be d sr -garb d, One, not
the least important, is 10 keep the Federal
Governm'-nt always in a coudi ion to dis
charge, w til case and vigor, its highest
functions, should their exercise be required
f?y any sudden conjuncture of public affurs
?a condition to which wc are always exposed,
and which may occur when it is
iiuJisnensablo that i s fi.i inees shoul 1 b i
untrammelled, mid its resources, as far a*
practicable, unincumbered. No circum.
stance could present greater obstacles to
the accomplishment of these vitally important
objects, than the creation of an onerous
national debt. Our own exp-ripnee, ami
also tint of other nations, have demonstri
ted ibe unavoidable au<J fearful rapidity wit >
which a public debt is increased, when the
Government has surrendered isolf'o the
ruinous practice of supplying its supposed
necessities by n 4w loans. The struggle,
therefore, on our part, to b" successful,
must be made at tie* t r tsb.hol J. To m ike
our odor s effective, severe economy is necessary.
This is the surest provi-uon for
the naionai wolfare ; and it is, at the same
litne, the best preservative of lite principles
it which our insti'utions rest. Smpieity
and economy in the affairs State have
i.ever failed to chasten and invigorate Rc
publican principles, while these have been
as surely subverto J by national prrdigal ty,
under whatever specious pretext it may have
been in reduced or foster* d.

at the present moment file'r force is augmented
by lite necessity whic h a d 'cr asi

g ven to importations of articles subject

of internal trade, and especially tho re luc
tion gndua ly taking place m our tuiiffol
duti s. all tend materially to lessen our receipts;
indtcd i is probable the diminution
resulting from the last cause alone, will not
fall short of five? millions of dollars in the
year 1842, as the final reduction of'nll duties
to t wenty per cent, then takes effect. Tue
whole revenue then accruing from the cuv
.oms, and from the sales of public lands, it
not more, will undoubedly be wanted to

With the Legislature rest ;lie power
and duty of so adjusting the public exnendi
ure as to promo e this end. B> tho pro.
visions of the Constitution, it is only in
consequence ofappropia ions made by |aw,
li.it money can be drawn from tho T eas.,
ury; no instancu Ins occurred since tlio establishment
of the Government in which the
Executive, though n component part of
the Legisla ive power, has in'erpos.'d an oh.
jection to an appropriation biil on the sole
ground of its extravagance. His duty in
this respect has been considered fulfilled bv <
requesting such appropriations only as the
public service may be reason .bly expect'-d i
;o require. In the prcasant earnest direc. <
ion of he public mtnd towards his subject, i
ioth the Execu ive and the Legislature have |
widence ofthe strict responsibility to which i
.hey will bo held ; and while I am conscous t
5f my own anxious efforts to perform with i
fidelity this portion of my public functions, (
it is a satisfaction to me to be able to count
on a cordial Co-operation from you.
At the time I entered upon my present
duties, our ordinary disburden) Mits-?without

which grew ou' of an overflow i.ig Treasury
. In lependent of the redemption of
the public debt and trusts, the gro.saexpnditures
of seventeen and eighteen millions in
1834 and 1835 had, by ti?ese cius-s, swell*
od to twenty nine millions in 1836 ; and the
appropria ions for 1837. ma le previously io
the4thof March, cuusedlhe expenditure to
rise to the very large amount of thirty-three [
millions. We were enablijd during the
year 1838, notwithstanding the c-?i):mu *il< e
of our Indian embarrassments, somewhat
o reduce this amount { nnd that for th
present year, 1839. will not in all probability
exceed twenty-si millions?or s:x
millions less ilun it *as last year. W.tUa

of'hit N ivy respecting the disposition
of our snips of war, that it has bf?en deemed
necessary to sia'ion a competent force on i
the coast of Africa, to prevent a fmudu'ent
use of our fl ig b\ foreigners.
Recent cxo- rience has shown that the
provisions in our existing laws \vhi?*li relate

Tnese cir dmstances make it prop- r to vecomniend

additional communications from other sour*

The latest accounts from the Exploring
Expedition reprs'-ni it as proceeding successfully
in i ii objects, and promising resul s
no less useful to trade and navigation ih in

The extent of post roads covered by mail

j 133 991 mil s, and tlie rale of annual .runs*
portation upon them 34.496.878 miles.?
Th?- numh'T of post offices on that d:iy
was 12 760, and on the thirtieth ultimo,
13,028.

The cash oti hand on the 30th ultimo,
was abou $206 701 05, and the current
income ol the Department varies vry little
from the rite of current expend',ures.?
Most of the service suspended last year has
been restored, and most of the new rou es
esiab.ishi-d by the act of 7ih July, 183"*,
have be. n set in operation at an annual cost
of $136 063. Notwiths anding l?;e pecuniary
difficulties of the country, the reve.
nue of the Department appears to be inereasing--and
unless it shall he seriously checked
by the recent suspension of payment by
so mmy of die bunks, it will be able no'
o.ily to maintain the present mad service,
but in a short time to extend it. It is gratifying
to witness the promp'itudeand ft lohty
with which tin; agents of this Department in

Some diffi uil n s hav" arisen in relation
to contracts f >r the transportation of the

It appears th>t the max mum t)l

not sufficient to induce some of the eompani's
to convey them at such hours as are

" "J ? - - -J
Senate, showing tlie trial docket of each ol
tii*? Circuit Cour s, and tlie number of mile>
each judge has to travel in the performatfee
of his duties, a great in> quality appears in
the amount oflahor assigned to each judge.
The number of terms to he held in each or
he courts composing the ninth cireu t, the
distances between the places at which they
sit, and from thence to the seat of Govern
merit, are represented to be such as to render
it--impossible for tlie Judge of that circuit to
perform, in a m inner correspond tig with
the public exigencies, his term and circuit
dudes. A revis on, 'lierefore, of the ptegeni
arrangement of tiic circuits swing to be
culled for, and is recommended to your notice.
I think it proper to call your at'ention 'o
the power assumed by Terri'orial L''gisla.
lures o authorize the issue of bonds by
corporate companies on tiie guarantee of
the Territory. Congress pass d a law in
183G, providing that no act of a Territorial
Legislature incorporating bank*should have
the forre of law until approved by Congress,
but acts of a very exceptionable character
Florida, wore suffered to remain in force, s
by virtue of whic;> bonds may e issued to s
a very large nmount by those ins itu'ions, I
uj on the faith of he lerri'ory. A resolution i
nteuding to be a joint one passed the i
S?*nti e at the same session, expressing the ?
sense of Congress that the laws in ques ion s
ought not to be permitted ;o remain in lorce >
unl'-ss amended in many materi d respects,
but it failed in the House of R 'jirt'senta .ves \
f r want of lime, and the desired amend f
ments have no: been made. The interests ?
involved are of great importance, and tbe i
subject des"rvcs your eaily and careful i
i u't' n'ion. |
Tne continu-d agiution of tlie question i
rela've to the best mode of keeping and i
disbursing the public money, still injurious- I
ly uffic s the business ol the country.?
Fne suspension of specie pay men's in 1837, 1
rendered the use of deposte banks, as
prescribed by the act of 1836, a soune
rather of embarrassment than aid, and of
necessity placed the custody of most of the
public money afterwards co lected in charge
of the public officers* The new securities
for its safety, rhich this required, were u
principal cause of my convening an extra
, session of Congress ; but in consequence ,
jof u disagreement between the two Houses,
neither then, nor ut any subsequent pe iocf,
Ims there heen any legislation on the sub.. "
i ject. The effort made at the last session

th * use of public money for priv;it<? purpo,
ses as a crime a measure attended under
other Governments with signal advantage,
wag also unsuccessful, from diversities of
opinion in that body, notwithstanding the
anxiety doubtless felt by it to afford every
. practicable security. The result of this is
still to leave the custody of the public, money
without those sufe.gu irds which h ive been
( for several years earnestly d-sired by the
? Ex cutivo ; and as the remedy is only to
1 tie found in the action of the Legislature, it
. iinpog g on me the duty of again submitting
10 )outiu.? propriety of passing a law, providing
for the safe keeping of the- public
moneys, and especially to ask that i's use
for private purposes toy any officers entrust,
ed with it, maybe declared to be n felony,
punishable with penalties proportioned to
o the magnitude of 'he offence.
? These circumstances, added to known
defects in the existing laws, and unusual
derangement in the general operations of
1 trade, have, during the las' three years,
much increased the difficulties attcn nnt
?>n lie collection, keeping, and disbursem

excluding the case of the Ire collector at

The defalcation of the late collector at h<t

which Congress Iitis bo'-n 'u!ly informed, ran
through all the modes of keeping the public

that th? desirhd legion'ion of Congress

tho highest degree of sncurty and
facility. Such also appears to bavo b en
die experience of other nations. From die
results of inquiries made by the Secretary
of the Treasury in regard to the practice
among them, I am enabled to state that in
weiry-two out of twenty-seven foreign
Governments from which undoubted information
has been obtained, the public moneys
re kept in charge of public officers. This
concurrence of opinion in favor o( thatsys.. 1
tern is perhaps as great as exisis on any
question of internal adminislrut'on.
In the modes of business and official re- 1
sirain s on disbursing officers no le. ol '
change was produced by the suspension of I
specie pa\ ments The report last referred <
fo will he found to contain also much useful i
information in relation to this subj -ct. 1

rny reasons for believing that die es ablishi

mcnt oi an in?'?*pcnu< ni i^iui ojiui i rcusun, i
as contemplated by the Constitution, is tie- 1
cessary in the safe act on of ili<? Federal 1
Government. The suspension of specie I
payments in 1837, by the banks haying the
custody of the. public money, allowed in so 1
alarming a degree cur dependence on those I
.r.stitutions for the performance of duties <
required by law, that I then recommended i
lie entire dissolution of that connection i
<? '
Th:s recommendation has been subjected,
as I desired it should be, to severe scrutmy 1
ind animated discussion ; and 1 allow myit
lfto believe th.it, notwithstanding the naural
diversities of opinion which may.fe
mticipated on all subjects involving such
mpoitant considerations, it has secured in
ts favor us general concurrence of public
lentiment as could be expected on one of
iucli magni udc.
Recent events have also continued to dc/elopenow
objections to such a connection.
Seldom is any bank, under the existing
*ystem and practice,abfi^to meet, on demand,
all i's liabilities for depositee end
antes in circulation. It maintains specie
payments, and transacts a profitable business,
only by the confidence of the public
in its solvency ; and whenever this is destroyed,
the demands ofits depositors and
no'eholders?pressed more rapidly than it
can make collectors from its deStors?force
it to slop payment. This loss of confidence
with its consequences occured in 183*7, and
afforded the apology of the banks for their
suspension. The public then acqiesccflm the
validity of the excuse; and, while the State
Legislatures did not exact from them their
forfeited charters, Congress, in accordance
wi h the recommendation of the Executive,
allowed them lime to pay over the. public
money they hel.J, althhough compelled to
issue,Treasury notes to supply the deficieney
thus created.
> it now appears that thero arc other motives
than a want of public confidence under which
the? banks seek to justify themselves in
a refusal to meet their obligations. Scarcely
were the country nnd Government relieved,
in a degree, from the difficulties occasioned
by the general suspension of 1837, when a
partial one, ocruring within thirty ittonths of
the former, produced new and serious emharrussments,
though it had no palliation
sue!) circumsiances as were alleged in justification
of tint which had previously taken
place. Tnere was nothing in the condition
of the country to endanger a well managed
banking ins'.itut on ; commerce was deranged
by no foreign war ; every branch of
manufacturing industry was crowned wiili
rich rewards ; and the more than usual ab.
undairo of our harvests, after supplying our
Jonvstic wnnts. had left our granaries and
sore.bouses fiijed with asurplusfor cxpormtion.
It is in the midst of this, that an
irredeemable und depreciated paper currency
is en ailed upon the people by a large
portion of die banks* They ure not driven
toil by the exhibition of a loss of public
confidence, or of a sudden pressure from
their depositors-or note holders, but they
excuse themselves by alleging thai the current
of business and exchange with foreign
countries, which draws the precions metals
from their vaults, would require, in order
to nv ot i>, n larger curtailment of their
loans to a comparatively finall portion of
the community, than it will bo convenient
for them to hear, or perhaps safe for the
banks to exact. The plea lias ceased to be
one of necessity. Convenience and policy
are now deemed sufficient to warrant these
ms'itutio. s in disregarding their solemn oblig
uions. Such conduct is not merely an
injury to individual creditors, but it is a
wrong to the whole community, from whose
lib rainy they hold most valuable ptiyilcgcs
?whose rigliis h< y violaio, whose business

(T)ust l>e evident that this new ground fcf
b ulk suspensions, in reference to which their
action is not only disconnected with, but
wholly independent of, that of the public,
gives a character to their suspensions more
a'nrming than any which they exhibited beforivnd
greatly increases the impropriety of
r lying on the banks in the transactions of
tue Government.
A largo und highly respectable portion of
our banking institHtions lire, it affords mo
unf? igned pleasure to state, exempted from
all blame on account of this second delin--^ ^
quency. They have, to th? ir groat credit, not
only continued to meet their engagements,
but have even repudiated the grounds of
suspension now reported to. It is only by
sit dt a course thai the confidence and good *
will of he community can be preserved,
and. in the sequel, die best interests of tho
ins'itutions themselves promoted.
New dangers to the banks are also daily
disclosed from the extension of that system
of extravagant credit of which they are the

ded by the facilities afforded by die banks,
mere credit has become too commonly the
basis of radc. Many of the banks litemselves,
not content with largely simulating
tins system among others, have unsurped
the business, while they impair the stability
o: the mercantile community ; they hnve become
borrowers instead of lenders, they establish
their .agencies abroad ; they deal
largely in stocks and merchandise ; they
encourage the issue of State securities until
the foreign market is glutted with them ;

their own capital and the exercise of their
lawful privileges, they raise, by large loans,
a Iditional means for every variety of spec,

deviation from the former course of business
in tins country, ore now shared alike by
banks and individuals, to an extent of which
th^re is prhaps no previous example in the
annals of our country. So long as a willingness
of the foreign lender, and a suffic;ent
export of our productions to meet any
nec ssaiy partial payments, leave the flow
of credit undisturbed, all appears to be pros.
,,erous ; hut as soon as it is checked by any
hesitation abroad, or by an inability to make
payment there in our productions, the evils j
of the system are disclosed. The paper
currency which mi?ht serve for domestic
purposes, is useless to pay the debt due in
Europe. Gold and silver are therefore
drawn in, for their notes, from tho
bunks. To keep up their supply of
coin, these nsiitutions are obliged to coll

principally in their own notes, whieh sre ns
