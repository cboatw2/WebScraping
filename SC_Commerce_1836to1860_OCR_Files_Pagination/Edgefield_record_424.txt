alrowers of rain full in this neighborhood, on
Friday last.
aDomestic Writing Paper..-We have in our
possession, some good writing paper. made at
the Greenville paper mill. as ve are informed.
its quality is not of the finest, but its texture is
certainly good. and it is well adapted to all or
dinary business purposes. One great recon
mendation, is its cheapness. We occasionally
write upon it, our editorial notions.
Domestic Iron Manufactory.-We have re
cently seen at the Store of lessrs. Nicholson &
Presley, a keg of* nails which were tmanufac
tared at soine iron works in Spartanburg Dis
trict. We unhesitatingly pronounce theta e
qual, if not superior to any which come to this
market, from the North. We heartily wish stc
cessto the enterprising proprietoas of these iron
works.
Two candidates have offered themselves for
the office of State Senator rom Charleston
Ker Boyce and Juo. S. Ashe. Both have de.
clared themselves in favor of 31r. Van Buren
for President, and Col. J. P. Richardson for
Governor.
The following gentlemen were, on Monday,
the 14th inst., elected members of the Town
Council of Aiken, to serve for one year:-Ii
tendant-Capt. Wm. Robertson, Jr. Wardens
-Stephen Owens, Jas. Tupper, Lewis Jones,
Jr. S. Lee Allison.
At an election held at Greenville Court
House,S.C.on the 14th inst.. Win. Blasingame,
Esq. was elected Intendant, and J. Choice,
Esq., Dr. J. Crittenden, Col. Tandy Walker,
and Capt. It. Loveland, Wardens, for the en
suing year.
The hharleston Board of Health report the
deaths of twenty persons in that city. during
the week ending 13th inst-stranger's fever,
four.
Ve have yielded reluctantly to the rgent
request of some of our patrons. to republish the
Clarendon Resolutions of August. 1834. In
these resolutions Col. J. P. Richardson concur
red, and this stale matter is now revived.doubt
less, for the purpose of exciting prejudice a
gainst him, as a candidate for Governor, and
probably against some of his friends, who are
seeking other offices. If however. Col. R.
alone, or a few other individuals wvith him
were concerned in this mtatter. we should leave
them to, take care of themselves. but we regard
the prosperity and especially the tranquility of
the.State as involved, and we mttst say a few
words of explaniation and ca.,tion. Who shall
be our next Governor, is a question of subor
binate concern, which should not affect our
District elections, and wvhich has been already
sufficiently discussed in our columns. bnt it is
a much graver question whether the angry feel
ings exhibited in the Nullification controversy
shall be wantonly renewed when the merits of
the contest htave long been adjuted. We can
not expect that our Union friends will tamely
submit to be continually rated for their past
errors, without making some efforts for their
own vindication and some assaults upoa their an
cient a'dversaries. We are as tirmly convinced
now its we ever we. e of the trutth and value of thae
doctrine of Nullification. but we are content that
it should be held in reserve until an occasion
for its application be presented, anid that the
adoption of this creed shall not be the exclusive
test of political merit ini all contingencies. A
good knight does not always sleep in his armour,
and a true patriot will not stigmatize his allies,
and reinounce their aid, because they may have
once wvarred against him.
In a controversy so king and bitter as that
which prevailed in this State concernitig the
proper remedy for the oppressions of the Pro-]
tectory System, it is natural to suppose that
passion sometimes usurped the place of reason,
and thaterrors on both sides Pmay have been corn.
mitted. In the letter of Cul. Richardson's pub
lished in out last number, he distinctly announ
ees that if the Tariff controversy should recur,
he would support the State wvith all his energy,
without stickling about the particular mnode of
action, and after such a declaration, must lie beI
forever proscribed on account of his first disa
greemnent with the majority of ouar citizens?
The Clarendon Resolutions were Founded
upon tate misapprehension by the Union party
of the views and objects of their opponlents i n<
advocating the Oath of Allegiance. The Utnion
party supposed that the N~ullifiers in supporting
this measure, intended to renoutnce all obedi a
ence to the Federal Government, its Lawvs, I
Treaties, and Constitiutioin, baut when th is wvas
disavowed by the Nullifiers, in te Report of

the Vermont elections.
"VERMON.-The mmtaority of Horace Everett
for Coigress, at the late electioin, over his cip

Whig writers constantly attrilmte the peci
niary distress of the country, to the past and
present Administrations. Johin Tyler Ieir can
didate for the Vice-Presidency, is doulitless,
good anuthority with them.
From the subjoined extract, it appears that
Mr. Tyler ascribed the great commercial emi.
barassment which prevailed in the country
upwards of twenty years ago, to the Banking
system. We know not, what may be the ii.
pinion of A r. Tyler now; mnor is it a matter or
amly consequence. When lie miade the follow
ing remarks, hie! was a tmetiber of the Uniited
States Senate, and-doubtless, spoke the hottest
sentiments of his heart. Ile says in a speech
delivered by him in the Seiate. April 5, 1819 :

Tie Hooe Case.-A great deal has been said
in Whig newspapers all over the country, in
ibuse of the course of Mr. Vane Buren, in the
celebrated case of Lieumntenant ooe. We copy
