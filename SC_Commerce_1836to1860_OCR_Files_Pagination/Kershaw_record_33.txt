Early in the morning the firing of cannon announced
the approach of ibe birth day of a great

ta toe Mouse ot Uod by an acknowledgment ol our
obligations to Hj* in whose hands is the destiny of
nations. After Divine service, many ofour citizens
both of the town and district, convened at Cool
8pring, where they partook ol s sumptuous dinner
given to the Kershaw Volunteers, by tbeir gallant
commander, Col. Jonx Chcsfct, whose polite invitation
afforded us the gratification of being present,
where we witnessed, with the most pleasing
emotions, the desire on the part uf all to unite in
feeling and sentiment in doing honor to these to
whom honor is so joslly doe.
The regular toasts we have not been furnished
with, and therelorc leem it inexpedient to publish
part of the volunteers drank on the occasion.

ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS.
On Monday last, this body, by jaint resolution,' 1
to hare adjourned. In noticing U?c day tjw j

ays:

One migki suppose that U?c Congrrwof the Urn* |
ted Stale*, were, to reality, a mere automaton in the j <
hand* of the Executive, bat for the he!, thst if; <
they were *o disposed, a/mcst an jr thing could be |'
made into a law ia despite of the Executive and ail ,
his officers, whore concert would be observed, and '
coaaeicacc thrown aside. Yet in this land of free- J
dots, where every one baa a right to form an opin- j
ion for himself, and act accordingly, it cannot bo j
supposed, either that Congress is "servile" to the (
Executive, or " disgraoefol" to the country?only jj
so far as it may adhere to the true letter and spirit i
of the Constitution, and opltold the Executive of- !
freer in the fhithfu! performance of bin duUes to Jti?;
conotry?and thus fiuatrato tl.-c wild and danger- {
out theories of apostatised and defeated politician* . 1
Independence bec...mea "servile and dirgtaccfut" |
in the eyes of torn* if the course adopted , )
should happen to be contrary to tlrir panicoUr at- 1
price?this is the case in the present instance.
Again, in lite next paragraph of the saute Article, c

tiou of Ibe notorious and nefarious ny dee da in t he "

and many others demanded prompt and decisive lr- '

We would aak who has dane so ranch to prolong j,
tlic present session of Congress, and dcfi-ai every li
important measure before that body, as Hx?bt A. v

done as much to the " iuzratt" of the country as a
thai single individual; and yet poor Vas and his J'
friends must answer for the siu* and tollies of the ! L
opposition.

JAMES MADISON la ?o aotti!
The last of the great lights of the Revolution,
the brightest of those great minds, which, like the
pillar of fire of old, conducted the American Israel
through the trials of the scarcely less important
era following the Revolution, and gave to his country
the repose, aecurity, and hamuness of a wise,
regular, staple, and consolidated Government; this
Eurc and Icautilul and oeiiign iigm naj at lasisuna
plow the horizon, and .? quenched lorerer in Una
world. Glorious indeed has born its long roarer,
and though no more to be seen, it has left a radiance
in the firmament at which his country will long
gaze with admiration end gratitude.
For more than thirty years, the name of Janus
Man so* has, more than that of anv other living
man, been associated, in the mind of United America,
with the principles and the fabric of our Government.
He was the principal architect in its
construction, il he did not lay its comer stone.-?
He lived to sec it endure many trials, survive great
dangers, and to promise endurance for ages
lie died on the morn.ng of Tuesday, the 2?lh
of June He was born on I ho lGlh of March, in
the year 1751; and was o! course, whrn be died, of
the patriarchal age of more thau eighty five years.
His end, visibly approaching for some days before,
wssuch as that of a good and great man
ought to be. His faculties undimmed till his latest
hours, be expired without a struggle, free from
pain, tree from regret, and front cause of reproach.

According to my own opinion, not new, hot of
long standing, the Federal Treasury never should
have been in such a situation as to render ntcciwa
rv the toeaaore above stated. That coarse ot policy
on the part of the General Government which

if not unoonstilulional, because it results from a
rcale of duties which takes moor - out of the pocket;

A splendid Cotton PUuitation

THAT valuable plantation, known by the 4
name of 8UMMERFIRLO, situated in t
Hiods county, (Mississippi) immediately on ,
the Rail Hold from Vicksburg to Clinton
and Jackson, (the seat of government,) 25
miles from the former, and the same distance
' from the latter place; 12 miles from Clinton,
is now offered for sale?the fnoprietor hav
ing determined to cnange nts occupation.? ,
To give a minute and detailed description of '
' the property, is deemed entirely oaoecessary,
t as no person it is presumed, would make such
a purchase without examination. Suffice it '*
to say that this tract of land, which consists 1
of 800 acres, is decidedly the roost valuable,
of its size, of any in this section of country. *
With one exception it was all entered at an *
early period, wheo the whole country was
open to select frotn. A large part of it is
i Rick Cone Bottom Land, Baker's creek, a
stream of considerable magnitude, affording excellent
mill and gin sites, running through 1
it. 1
About 100 acres of the tract extends into 1
the kills and covers a beautiful building site
and settlement, it bciog quite elevated, and
far remote from all local causes of disease. '
Indeed, the whole neighborhood in which 1
this land is situated a reputed very healthy.
The improvements of the place consists of '
250 acres of open land, a good gin and press, t
negro cabins, dec. p
With this plantation would be sold 14 1
working bands, all young, likely and acdi* 1
mated; or the number would be added >o if J
desired. Also, the stock of horses, mules, 2
oxen, wagon, working utensils, dec. c
There is a growing crop on the place, coo*
sisting of 120 acres couoo, besides corn, oat*,
dtc. which would be sold with the place if ^
desired, and possession given at any time the
purchaser might wish. If pre fared, the
land would be sold without the hands.
Any rcaaooabte time will be given, upon
the payments being well secured; but the <
price would be much reduced for prompt pay- I
meats. 1
This property will be shown, and the terms [
made koown, upon application to the sub- t
scriber, on the premises, or to A. Jackson ?
