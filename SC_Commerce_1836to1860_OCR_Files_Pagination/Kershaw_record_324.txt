The Pe.ntvscla of Florida.?Great
is the error which has prevailed as to the
vaiue and importance of this peninsula.?
It is a division of territory of great commercial,
agricultural, political, and military
importance, and the h jhest considerations
of national policy require it to be reclaimed
from the savages, covered with
our population, and made subservient to
all our views of strength, security, and
interest.
In the first place, it is a country of great
extent, not less than forty thousand square
rr.iie-, counting what is east of the Suwannee,
up to the Georgia line. This
great extent of country is, what its descriptive
appellation imports, almost an island.
being surrounded by the sea, except
where it touches Georgia and West
Florida. It presents a sea coast of nearly
one thousand miles in circuit, and must
\ necessarily iiave mnratime interests and a
, ' inaratiinc population, engaged in commerce,.
in the fisheries, in the coasting
... Trade, and in trade with the West Indies.
Independently of the pursuits of agriculture,
it will supp' i'i a numerous oopu'a,
lion.
In the ne::t place, it is a salient angle
of the country; it Is a tongue of land projecting
itself three hundred miles beyond
the general line of our S ?utiiern frontier,
rand extending itself down to the nohrhh-?rl:-)od
oi the British possessions in the Bahama
Island?, and the Spanish possession'*
i of Cuba; and it is surrounded bwshnds
- * and keys belonging to the United States,
"3 and which must be possessed and defended
by us or which will be. occupied by
others to our annoyance, and to their do?
lii'nii n ir* ti!f? Ihtlf of Mexico. Ina miii
: t&rv point of.view, tho complete posso>
j siou, occupation and defence of the whole
P peninsula of Florida, is of the highest imv;
portatico to the Southern States, and to
the security of a!! our interests on the
' <.k;!f frontier. No military eye can overlook
this peninsula in providing for the
common dof'nee <*f the country: ar.dnow,
the' wo have undertaken to reclaim and
jv o-v; if, no earthly consideration should
; luce the abandonment of that plan,
j.. In the third place, an I contrary to all
previous belief, there is a great deal of
i good land in this peninsula, capable of
/ forming compact and strong agricultural
settlements, and extremely valuable on
'; account of the productions it admits of.?
. i On tliis point we present the following cx!
tract from l)r. Lvwso:,h> letter, which,
' / being the result of personal observation,
i may be fully confided in:
"Tlierc is an extensive range of counr|
try.ami of very good land between the
, cove of the Withlacoochce and Silver
Spring branch, at the head of navigation
011 the Ocklawaha, and there are many
good tracts between these two rivers, cx;
tending to the Indian settlement called Pilakiikair1,
where there is another body of
|. good land.
"This section of ceo .try is capable cf
supporting several thou emd inhabitants;
there is a plenty of gam; in it. and the rivers
and lakes in the vicinity afford fish in
abundance; and, withal, it has the ad\
vantage of water communication by the
Niyithlacoochee with the Gulf of Mexico,
& anhhtfirough the Ocklawaha and St. John's
'*}{ river \*?th the Atlantic. In addition to
%-ihosc considerations, there are several
liealthy {joints in the country, particularly
in the viciiiity of Fort King; and here a
* large settlement should be made, as it
-will bo the barrier between the Indians
i and the white settlements, and constitute
the base of Operations.
"There aro some good lands on Talakchopto,
both near the head of the river
where it is called Pease Creek, and on
the lower banks near the head of Charlotte'.*
haibor.
. " There are three or four good tracts
\ or or ncarthe banks of the Colosa-Hatchee,
| particularly hi vicinity of Fort ThompI
son, at the great crossing of the river.?
f Fish and game abound, I believe, in this
; region. I am not so satisfied as to the
healthfulness of'- this section of the country;
but i* should bp occupied at all risks.
as it is on the line of the nearest pract icab!e
route between the Gulf and the Atlantic
side of the peninsula.
"A few good tracts can be gotten on
shores, and on islands within Marcus
i sound, near Cape Roman.
" There is a beautiful tract of land on
j Pavilion river, ten or twelve leagues southj
east of Cape Roman, and some parcels
of good land may be found on the banks
of Shark river, and on the shores of Lake 1
Maniton, ten leagues still farther east.
"At Cape Sable there is a beautiful j
spot for a military post and depot for a [ i
colony, which should be established on a; I
prairio, running east and by north from
that Cape along the coast towards Cape j;
| Florida. This prairie runs immediately h
ii _i r c..~ :i~_ I
on me sua snuie iui umiy-iive nines, men 1
| turns a little north and to the interior of the
country. From what I saw of the pro- i
ducts of the land on the cape and the islands
in the vicinity, I am induced to believe
that the soil of this prairievwill pro- i
duce in great perfection, grain and vegetaj
bles of every kind, with sugar cane, cotton,
&c. &c. Through the prairie there 1
; are numerous clumps and groves of trees,
which will afford both fuel and building
timber for the settlers. The keys and
sand-bars in front of the cape make an excellent
harbor for steam-boats and other
vessels drawing from six to ten feet water.
The waters along this coast are full of turtle,
and fish of cveiy kind, and the prai- 1
: rie and woods around abound in game.
! "The immediate site of Cape Sable is 1
evidently healthy, as arc almost all situa- 1
tions directly on the sea board; and I have 1
no doubt that healthv positions can be cot- 1
ten on the prairie, as the climate is de-11
lightful even in the summer season, from j 1
the prevalence of the sea breeze, or trade '
winds. ;
" There are also good tracts of land on '
Now River, and a great body of it on In- i
dian River, both on the Atlantic side of 1
the peninsula; and near this last river, on
St. Lucie's sound, another settlement
should bo made. This section of country,
being within the ifiuencc of the sea at- <
mosphere, should be healthy; fish abound ]
in the rivers and sounds about, and game
perhaps is plenty in the country."
General JIeh.vwdez. a native of St.
Augustine, and every way acquainted with
East Florida, and the peninsula, also,
thus speaks of it in a letter to the Military
Committee of the Senate:
"I have read, with much interest, the 1
loiter ot the burgeon Cencra', Dr. Lawson.
aud I was mucii pleased to find that
he does not think the country as unhealthy
as it has been represented Coming from
so disinterested a source, his statements
cannot fail to remove impressions not less;1
erroneous man prcjudical to the counlry. I
His description of the country around
Cape Sable will doubtless attract attention,
and I hope many of our citizens,
who are locking to Texas and other foreign
climes, may sec it, and be induced <
to seek in Florida a residence where they
will fiud a soil and climate equal to the <
best, and a country just as easy of access.
" Here I beg leave to say, that the country
cast of the Suwannee river is capable i
of sustaining an immense population, and i
must, in the political order of tilings, even- 1
taally form a State separate from that 1
of Middle and West Florida, and greatly <
to their advantage and that of the coun- i
trv. In this Dart of Florida, exclusive of i
lhe extensive hammocks and very productive
pine lands, there are great bodies of
savanna, swamp, and meadow lands, composed
of the richest soil; to wit: alluvial,
clay, and marl, much of which, when
properly reclaimed, will, south of St Augustine,
produce two crops of grain each
year.
" On two hundred acres of reclaimed
swamp lands, I made an average of thirtysix
bushels of Cuba seed corn per acre,
while, at the same time, a crop of sugar
canc tvas growing on the same two hundred
acres, the manufacture of which was
prevented by the war. .
"This is the only portion of the United
States possessing a tropical climate. The
advantages which, I believe, will grow
out of the adoption, by Congress, of this
measure, for the occupation and settle- s
mcnt of it, will soon render us, in some t
(degree, independent ot the West Indies, J
except in the article of coffee, which; I
think, cannot be there raised, owing to the <
blighting winds of autumn passing across t
the narrow peninsula. Sugar, Cuba to- }
bacco, and all the other staples and fruits (
of those islands, I believe will be cultivat- t
ed in great abundance in Florida. These
articles, together with the orange of the [
country, which is more highly valued than t
that of other places, with the aid of <
steamboats and railroads, can be sent to 1
the Northern and Western States in full s
perfection. i
"That Florida is also destined to be a <
great silk country is placed beyond a i
doubt. , s
"How different is the idea which these c
responsible letters give us of East Florida
from that which had been previously entertained.
Heretofore the whole peninsula
was thought to be uninhabitable
swamps, or barren sand and pine lands,
and the extremity of the peninsula especially
a low, sunken, wet, dreary waste
of sand and swamp, Instead of this we;
find large bodies of rich, dry land, capa-,
ble of producing sugar, cotton, and Cuba i
tobacco; the pine barrens, as we would;
call them, capable of producing the most'
valuable tropical fruits; the orange, le-j
mon, fig, plantain, cocoa, and the mu(-1
berry tree, in such perfection that, bearing.
Ieave3 nine months in the year, it would
feed three generations of silk worms in:
the year, and consequently give three;
croDS of cocoons. Goino- to the extreme
# 1 . O # 1
point of the peninsula, and there is found,
in a single body, sixty miles of rich land,
by twenty wide, all high and dry, with
a lime rock foundation, like the Bahama
islands possess, with a good harbor for
vessels of light draught. All this presents
the peninsula of Florida as a valuable
country in a mere agricultural point of
view; an aspect under which its contemplation
must, by no means, be confined.
Fourth. The peninsula of Florida is,
valuable for its fisheries. All the officers
who have served in that quarter, speak in
terms of admiration, both of the quantity
and excellence of the fish which are taken
there, and that both on the Gulf and Atlantic
shore. General Jesup, in relation
these fisheries, uses the following strong
language: " The coasts of Florida afford
as valuable fisheries in proportion to their
extent, as the banks of Newfoundland."
Great is the numhp.rof vessels, mostlv Sna
nish, which are now engaged in fishing on
these coasts. They fish nearly the whole
year round, salting down the parcels as
they are taken, and pushing off to Cuba,
and other islands to make sale of their
cargo as soon as the vessel is filled; thus
finding a market within a few days' sail.
With the peninsula settled, all this valuable
fishing would fall into the hands of our
citizens, and would be a source of great
profit to them, and a fine nursery of seamen
for the country. Great, also, are the supplies
of turtles and oysters in this quarter.
It is flic best turtle, ground on this side <bt
the South seas, and New Orleans and the
W est Indies, & some of the Atlantic cities,
now derive large supplies from them.
DCr3The Spaniards who now; fisifin this
quarter, are a main cause of the Indian
hostilities. Upon the continuance of these
J .1 1 il_ x!
nosiiiuics uepenu me conunuance 01 meir
lucrativeoccupations, with all the attend-,
ant advantages of robbing wrecked vessels.;
From these Spanish fishermen the Indians
obtain abundant supplies of arms and ammuniton,
and are encouraged to continue
the war. They and the Indians can hardly
be told apart; and many officers are
fully of opinion that they are engaged in
many of the massacres which take place
about, the point of the peninsula.
Fifth. Florida is valuable for its forests
of pine and live oak, the former for the t

Sixth. In connection with the keys and
islands which line the coasts and belong to;
it, this peninsula is also to be of great val- j
ne to it for salt It approaches within two!
degrees of the tropic of Cancer, and has
the advantage which most of the Bahama
islands is the chief, for the manufacture of
this prime necessary of life. Sunshine
and sea water are the elements of this pro-!
iuction, and these are possessed by the
Southern extremity of the peninsula and,
the circumjacent isles and keys.
Seventh. This part of Florida is the j
?nly part of the United States which will
produce the Cuba tobacco, generally worth
ibout thirty dollars a hundred in the Uni_j
i r. a ?r i.:?u i?.!
,eu oiuujs, ctiiu vac juic uuvui ui winuii uus,
Tiade us so largely tributary to Cuba for j
ligars and snuff. j
Eigth. All the coast of the peninsula is:
lealthy. This is attested by all the offi-|(
icrs who have been there. In this, the;<
coasts, and especially the extreme point, j
resemble the islands of the West Indies,
3eing open to the healthy, cooling and in- '
cigorating breezes of the sea. The health '
)f the interior part s4depend upon local cau- '
ses, and may be considered on a par with ?
he neighboring parts of Middle Florida
md Georgia. :
Ninth. The peninsula of Florida is the i
>nly part of the United States which pos- <
;esses a tropical climate, and which can <
lrofliic.e the ironical fruits and other nro- <
lucts, for which we are now so largely t
ributury to foreign nations. !
From these views, it is evident that the ;
jeninsula is not the uninhabitable morass, 1
he barren pine waste and the insalubrious s
dimate, which it had been thought to be, 1
>ut that it is intrinsically valuable in it- 1
self, and able to sustain a large population 1
n the vorious pursuits of commerce agri- I
culture, fishing, lumbering, &c. and, from <
ts position and form, indispensably neccs- I
;ary tobe possessed, settled, protected and I
lefended by the United States. Strong t
military works should be at. or near Cape
Sable, and on other parts of the coast, and
in connection with Key West and other
islands. The protection of commerce require
all our islands about the peninsula
to be inhabited by an orderly population
subjected to the restraints of law and government,
and ready to succor, instead of
to plunder vessels in distress.
The last and present administration, penetrated
with these great national views,
have commenced the business of rem oving
the Indians, settling the country', and making
the 40,000 square miles of East Flo-N
rida, now a desert waste, overrun by savages,
a fruitful and cultivated land, covered
by inhabitants, protected by defences and
tributary to the wealth, strength and security
of the Union. With this view the
country was purchased from the Indians
uy generous treaty stipulations years ago.
With this view military campaigns have
been carried on there at a great expense j
of life and money; with this view the arm- j
ed occupation bill was brought, to estab- j
lish 10,000 armed settlers in the country, j
and oay them in land for maintaining the
possession of it. The Southern Conservatives,
by joining the Abolitionists and Federalists
to defeat the views of the Administration,
defeated the this bill; and to their
conduct the continurnce of the war, with!
all its attendant calamities must be attributed.
^TJODK OUT FOR MuRREL MEX.?A few
days since, two gentlemen in a carriage |
came into the neighborhood of Joseph!
Spurgen, Esq. in Davidson County, and ]
sola a negro to i?ir. Jacoo lokely lor ouu
dollars.
Mr. Yokely paid them in two horses,
and 8100 cash?after which they left the
neighborhood.
The negro seemed well pleased with his
new home until Saturday night last, when
he decamped, and has not been heard of
SaIICC.
The presumption is, from circumstances
that the whole was designed by the negro
and men, to swindle Mr. Yokely out of
his property. After the men left, he was
seen to have a hundred dollar bill, and some
specie.
Mr. Yokely is said to be an honest and
hard working man, but not so well calculated
to judge between a Murrel man and an
honest man. It woul l be well for some
of our honest farmers and tradesmen to be
more on the alert towards strangers trafficing
through the country in negroes and
other stolen property.

Pork.?On enquiring yesterday, we
could not learn that a single hog had been
purchased this fall by our pork packers, or
that any contracts for hogs had been entered
into.
Hogs are more abundant than money.
Drovers cannot make sales or get offers.?
Threedollars per hundred has been named
but purchasers cannot be found to offer
that price, or drovers to take it. We doubt
whether there will be many hogs packed
this winter. No one seems to have much
money to invest in pork, and we understand
our banks will be unable to discount
a' dollar for that or any other business.

Lynching.?On Wednesday night, the
13th inst. six white men, some of whom
were painted, and one colored person entered
the house of Mr. Nathan Lambeth,
Davidson county, seized his person and
dragged him some distance from the house
and there gagged him and inflicted on his
body several hundred blows with sticks.
Four of the party becoming somewhat alarmed
at the consequences, fled, while
the other two remained and renewed the
beating, until Lambeth became insensible,
ind fainted.
In this situation the party left him, but,
lftcr coming to, he v.vh great difficult}-.
reached the house, and on Thursday night |
Jied. It is stated by the physician who ai:endcd
him, that he was scarred and la- j
:eratcd from his neck to his heels, and that j
here was the appearance of several blows
laving been inflicted on his stomach and
'.bdomen, the latter of which, no doubt, j
ivas the cause of his death. The ciroum- j
;tances that led to this glaring offence:
tvere these: A Mr. John Goss, who had}'
formerly resided in that neighborhood, but j
atoly returned from Missouri on business,1
iad deposited with Mr. John Lee between
eight and nine hundred dollars in -specie, j
for safe keeping. Thi3 money was taken 1
from the desk of Mr. L-, on Siia lcy nigh; {
the 3d inst. f
Suspicion having rested on a negraman "
of Mr. Lee, he was taken up, examined, '
and confessed that lie, in connection with
Lambeth, the person Lynched, had taken^
the money, and the greater portion oflt"
was then in Lambeth's possession. Tins'
confession of the negro no doubt led to the. ^
deed which followed. The two persons '
who were more directly concerned in this -;";,
transaction, it is said, have fled. As
matter will, no doubt, undergo a judiciifl;
investigation, and as'the parties implicated *r'H
are of very respectable standing,'we re-frain
from inak'-ng any comments on thls
outrage of all law, order, and civil liberty;^
