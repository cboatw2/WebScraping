BRUTAL SPORT.
A prize fight came off'on Tuesday lost
to Westehester Co. about 21 miles from
-New York eity, between Christopher Lil
ly and a young man named McCoy. which
rsulted in the death of the latter. Seve
ral steamboats went from New York load
ed with passengers for the scene. The con
duct ofthe fight seems to have been in the
highest degree revolting, nod the result
produced great excitement and indignation
an the city. Several persons bad been ar
rested as aiders and instigators. We ouote
the testimony of a single witness before the
Coroner's Jury,

, yesterday. It commenced two
talentes before I o'clock, there appeared
to be several persons acting as bottle bold
ers. Yankee Sullivan was one of them,
the fight lasted two hours and forty-one
minates. At. the 120tb round McCoy did
notnme up; sew McCoy lying in one
corner ot the ring, prostrate; I heard a
miaste or two afterward that he bad
swned; the whole mass of people then
rnshed to the centre of the ring; they then
cried out "stand back, give him air;" I
then went up to him and saw him on the
ad gasping for breath; he took only
t or four breaths, and then ceased to
breathe. I asked if there was a physician
em the ground. and was told there was one
near him; he was pointed out to me; I
should know him If I -aw him-, the body
was then carried to the brink of the river
and placed on some bushes; the physician
was still near him; I asked if the man was
dead and was told he was; I then took
hold of his arm, his pulse was still slightly
ptible; the body was 'hen taken on
athe Saratoga.
I came down in the steamboat Gazelle;
in the 86th round, I heard the cry - take
him away;" which was repeated in the
6th roand; heard no reply at either time,
at round 93, some person cried out "don't
give any time Lilly strike for his head ;"
expostlated to have him taken out of the
ring, several other persons did also; the
seconds paid no attention mo it , at the 106th
round some one cried out. -- Lilly knock

Whereas, the explanations contained
in his pretended pastoral letter of the 24th

France:
Resolerd, That the wardens of the

Foreign Afairs.-Though the manu
factaring riots have sensibly impeded and
confused the eestrent of business. yet if
the extent of them be considered, time of
feet has been much less disastrous than
might be expected. The traces of the
convulsion are even now fading fast a way
-and business has almost recovered from
the shock. This indicates not only great
energy in the Administration, but great
and general confidence in its power to
protect property and enforce order. The
rapidity of communication from point to
pomnt has gIven to the police a new power.
sad it isnow seen for the first time to
what an extent steam in its various forms
can mntmibly the effectiveness of an army.
The people had not calculated on that.
Cotton has, if anything. ained a little in
the two weeks since the former ndvices,
and there seems now no sufficienmt cause
in prospect for the depression of that sta
ple, n thing we like not-the extent
of speculation in Liverpool. Whmen that
once becomes the fashion of the market,
as it seems to be now, there are no natu
-al bounds to it, but the failure of credit,
which unfortunately is certain not to fall
till time mischief is done. The prevalence
of speculation leaves as iq doubt hew far
the late activity in the cotto-a market may
have any basis in substantial causes, and
it is very much to be lamentad that it
should not be nipped in the bud.
An excelleat and abundant crop in En
gland and in France, is now certain, anal
that cannot fail to have a great effect. if
not counteracted. The treaty with the
United States. and the settlement af the
Regency question in France are also in a
high degree favorable to business. On the
other hand our Tarid is most unfavorable,
and is likely to exert even a worse influ
ence on our valuable commerce with
France. than on that with England.
The great expense and still uncertan is.
sue of the English wars with China and
Alfghanistan have the the same unfavora
ble effect. These are not new causes of
depression, however, and only continue,
not add to the present causes for the dull
ness of trade.
In respect of the present porition of trade
then, it may be said that some of the un
favorable influences are disipated. and
though some are added, there is on the
whole a balance in favor of a revival and
restoration of the tone of the market,
which is likely to operate. as far our ex
ports are concerned, through the season.
The imports will probably be unusually
small, and the elfeCt Of this may be sensi
bly felt afterwards.-Char. MIercary.
Our wharves, our Bay-street. and most
of all our rail roads, give strong indications
of the approaching activity of our witter
trade. Our fall business, from the advan
ced and favorable influence of the seasons
on the maturing crop. has opened earlier
than usual, and it affords us no little grati
ficatioun to le able to testify to the uncom -
health enjoyed by our city. Indeed.at no
period has Charleston been more favored;
exempt from storms, pestilence and beat.
The activity prevailine at our rail road
depots-the ascending and descendinig
trains, freighted with passengers. merchan
dise and produce. are all evidences of tie
increased facilities afforded to a certai.
secure, and most prompt intercourse with
the interior. The roads are reported to he
in the best condition, andl all necessary ar
rangements have been made to speed for
ward the traveller and to give despatch to
business. From the marks on the boxes
of merchandise, it would seem an inter
course has already been opened by our
rail roads with the interior of Alabama and
Tennessee; and we feel confident that all
from that quarter, who try this route, will
find it the safest, the cheapest. and the
nmost expeditious avenue of communica
tion between the Atlantic and Western
States. The Carolina and Georgia com
panies. we understand, have made arrange
ments by which all despa:ch will be given
to goods destined for the West; and a strong
hope is now encouraged, that, through the
co-operaion of these companies, a coutin
uous lineof rail way will soon be comple
ted from Charleston to the waters of the
Tennessee.-harleston Courier.
Reported Accident.-The annexed letter
is from an annoymous source; we however

As.Aar. Thursday evening.
During the entire of this day we have
had rumors ofa dlreaful accident at Keese
ville, by the breaking ofthe Arch Bridge
over the Au Sable, by which several lives
were lost. The number was put by some
as high as 80. By the Burlington mail,
due here at 34 P. P. I find the following
endorsement on the way bill. The stage
lefl Burlington at 10 A. M. yesterday.
You will perceive there is no date.
"Mr. Reed. you will have David Miller
come. to Burlington by Girst stage, to attend
his brother's funeral, who was killed by
the falling of the Arch Bridge at Keese
v~ille, with from 10 to 30 mnen."
I have not besrd whbat caused the carry
ing away of tihe Brmdge. Some say a fresh
et in the river-others, that it broke down
by a crowad collected to witness a militia
training-others that it was by the coll-c
tion of a crowd to secure a deranged per
son; the satme cause wii:h led to time broak -
ing of time draw in the State .t. bridge in
this city.

Amercan Coua Bagging.-Cottonb
is to come in freely by thc rail road frmn
both llanmburg anda Columbia. We wvere
highly gratified yesterday at the sight of
several lots of Cotton at the depot paucked
in Bagging of coton, manufactured at the
Saluda Works near Columbia. The neat
and clean appearance of time Bagging anmd
the excellent condition of the biags, taust
give to cottons, packed in this frabic, a
most decided preference in the market.
After the Cotton is compacked in the feor
ign factory, the bagging is so superior
that it may be made available tao many
other useful purposes. We ur.derstanmd
that the factory at Society 1Dill, anmd sev
eral in Georgia. have untited with the Sa
Ida in converting a portion of our surplus
staple into the bagging whtich is to pack it
up for foreign export. WVe do not kunw of
ant enterprise that merits more than pa
tronage of our southern cotton growmmg
communities. It will be the most effectu
al measure to resist thec oppressive tax on
Cotton Bagging, and to admonish Ken
tucky that we can wake our own cottons
as subservietnt to our uses for packing up
our produce, as we were willing withiout
tribute to use her heomp. Carolinma is now
awakening to the true condition of things,
and while lher upposition to protective adu
ties remains unabaken, she will teach those
weo would impose them on her,th~at she can
profit at home from the exactions, by en
couraging her own manufactures, and liv
wi hin her own means. nntil more enlight
ened view~s shall influence and control our
legislation.-Char~lson Courier.
Bagging made of Cotton.-Memsrs.
Lumden & Eatonton have forwarded to
our office a sample of D agging made of
Cotton. at the Factory of William Wil
liams Esq. of Athens, in this Stats. This
bagginig is 44 inches wide, weighs 14
pounds- to the yard. and can be sold t'or
22 cnta nor yard. W~e itnvite thc Far
men of Baldwin to call and see the speci
men that is in this oflice. A better ar
ticle of Bagging. we venture to say; has
seldom been manufactured. The Farmera
of the surrounding counties will find a
large quantity of it for sale at the store of
the above named gentlemen in Eatonton.
We hope soon to see the day. when all the
cotton raised in Georgia, will be packed
in Bagging made of roton.-Milledge

Health of Columbia.-We learn with
surpriee. that a report is circulating in the
country, t hat our town is now very sickly.
So far from this being the case, it is very
healthy, and has been so throughout the
sumier, and there is every propect of its

of its prefe: unce in the following terms:
"The Morning Post has expressed a
preference for Mr. Calhoun as a candidate
for the Preuidency. simply because it be
lieves he is btter adapted to that position
than any other ian. In ability and char
acter he it equal at least, if not superior,
to any competitor; his doctrines are more

he is not a mere political manager- while
