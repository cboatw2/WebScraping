OREGON TERRITORY. .o
From the National Intelligencer. I ci
an" ai.yms OF senate rKOCKKDINUB. ! I
Moxday, January 1), 18 12. '
After n variety of slighter matter*, tlie detail of ' p
Which will lie found in another column, the Sen- j a
ate returned to the bill providing for the occupa- 1 tl
turn of the Oregon Territory ; upon which a do- : r<
bate of Mime interest and importance ensued, j /
opened by the Senator who had desired the delay ti
of the bill that he might have time to examine its ; s
provisions. o
Mr. Calhoun was glad (ho said) to learn from . c
lie Senator reporting it that the bill wus not
designed to contravene our conventions with ft
Great Britain. He had now taken time carefully p
to comparo it with our subsisting engagements to ^ u
titui power; ana tlic result oi ins scrutiny was, t
that there was 011c provision in it which would ' t
completely violate those engagements. I t
The Senator proceeded to give, with his usual ' ji
power of analysis, a summary of the ullcdgcd ' t
rights of both parties to the territory, and of the j c
manner in which those rights arc claimed to have ' e
arisen. Our claim embraces the coast of the j \
Pacific from latitude 51 dg. -10 min. to 42 dg.; 1
and has three several grounds : r
1st. That of the priority of discovery by Cap- j i
tain Gray, of Boston, in 1783, of the mouth of ! f
the Columbia, trorn this, according to the uni. ; 1
versal rule among civilized natir;1(>( loHows t|,c ! ,
right to the country watered by such river to its , 1
sources. This discovery was afterwards more I
completely explored by the expedition under the ' i
command of Captains Lewis and Clarke. j I
2d. Tho cession by Spain of all her rights of j ,
territory north of the 42d parallel of latitude. j '
3d. Tile l'rcnch claim, to which we succeeded, i I
On the other hand, Britain seta up her title to ! |
the same territory on Iho following grounds : j :
1 st. That they can plead priority of discovery |
by Moors, sailing under Vancouver.
2d. That, by the convention of Nootka Sound .
in 1790, Spain yielded to Great Britain free mid , i
open access, trade and settlement to British sub. i i
jects, in common with her own, upon this coast. I i
3d. They claim also the French rights, ceded |
to Spain in 1S03 by treaty between those two na- <
tiona. | i
These were respectively the grounds of claim. ! <
Now, as to the nature of the claims themselves, s
there was a difference. (Jrcat Britain alleged only
a right of equal admittance of her citizens for all j 1
purposes of settlement, trade, or hunting; while (
we asserted a title to complete and exclusive pos- | (
session. I i
Siacc this conflict of titles began, various elForts i 1
by negotiation have been made amicably to adjust 1
our rights. They terminated, on our part, in an c
offer of fixing, as a compromise, the parallel of
it) dg. as the limit between us on that coast ; and :
they oa their part, offered to claim nothing south
of the mouth of the Columbia, which is in about
latitude 46 dg.
This last attempt failing, both sides withdrew
the propositions which they had made, and left
their rights as before.
in ldl7,by a fresh ncgociution, it was settled
that our rC6[*.ctivc claims should for ton years remain
on the ground pn which the treaty of Nootka .
Sound placed Britain and Spain witli regard to
the same territory ; that is, common enjoyment of
it for purposes of trade and hunting, or settlement
for those purposes.
In 1827 a fresh attempt, conducted by Mr. i
Gallatin, was made to adjust this conflict of
claims. It was again ineffectual, and the parties
returned, us a temporary arrangement, to the convention
of 1817, yielding cao.h other possession in
common, with liberty to renounce the arrangement
on either part upon a year's notice.
It thus appears that Great Britain makes 110
claim to the right of colonizing, und that we, by
the convention, havo prohibited oursrlvi s from
taking exclusive possession or jurisdiction.
Such being either the original rights of the parties,
or the footing upon which, by treaty, they
had consented to have tliciu stand, tlje Senator
must (lie said) hold that this bill violates (lie treaty
of 1827, by conferring u|>on our citizens fixed pos.
session in grants of land. We do not, it is true,
at once confer it, but we bind ourselves to do so.
I'utting them in possession with this pledge 011 our
part, we in reality take fixed possesion ourselves.
It is a errant forming a complete reality as to our
assuming posscosion. The grunt of lands is the
highest and complctcst act of possession which a
sovereign can perform.
But since the claim which we set tip extends
notliward to latitude 51 dg., and since, hy this act,
we limit the settlers whom we invite only by our
own alleged territory, it follows that you, by this
hill, take |K>e?<ssion up to the extreme northern
extent of your supposed claim : so that you exclude
tGrcat Kritain, by this act, from the whole i
territory in debate with that (Government. To j j
this full extent, the bill is a complete taking of i i
possession. j i
Now if, on the other hand, you scrutinize the ' i
British acta, you will find that they have nothing ;
of equal extent or force. Their act of Parliament I
is not to take possession of the country, or grant |
its noil, hut to extend to British subject* there the j i
jurisdiction of their laws. jt
Mr. Calhoun, therefore, went on to contend
that we should violate the subsisting convention, 1 L
if, without giving the ycut's notice, to which it t!
hinds ut, we should put in force an act like tli.H. . li
He went on to insist upon the formidable issue to ! It
which such a course must bring us with a nation eve- ; tl
ry where dangerous to encounter, and more than a e
match for uh ou this distant coast, aceissible to v
our arms only l>y a land-march across the conti- lr
ncnt, while she can command it, not only from li
tliose Asiatic possessions where she has of late gi
been so successful, but with her liodics of Canadi- lo
n voyagers, themselves hardy and dangerous, but hi
wielding an unbounded influence over all the In- c>
dian races of tho northwest. With these to cut si
s?tf our eommunieatiens in the rear, the ditliculties hi
of any hostile cfTort overland would be to the hut ci
degree formidable. |?r
lie would, then pursue a jnster and surer policy: , th
not rush into a contest of which the event could j \v
scarcely be auspicious; hut leave to time and the ' lis
rapid march of our settlements the peaceful hut '
e.ertain enforcement of our rights. lx:ave the thing , to
to its own natural season, and, by.and.by, you h<
may us easily as one plucks a ripe peach gathe r w
what now it would he hardlv possible to tear 01
nway. I,ct us (said the Senator) recall a little v.
the vast and rapid sweep of that population which sr
we carry on, and you will sec whet her there is any ju
extravagance in that on which I insist. Remcm | l>l

ion, lie looked on the bdl most favorably ; and
|?oke with a complete resolution to maintain all
ur rights over the territory, which could be exeriscd
in conformity with the treaty.
Mr. Hinn said that the Senator had, with great
urce and truth, compared the mighty tluw of
opulatioa westward to the rolling in of a great
nd wide stream, llut he should rcmcinlicr that
lie policy of the Government itself has of late, in
he disposition made of manv of the crrenter Indian
ribcs, raised up artificial barriers, wliicli have at
i risen I stopped that natural spread of population.
)n the South and the Southwest it lias reached
>ur limits. This outlet of the West must be openid,
or it will break across the liounds within which
vc have pledged ourselves that the expatriated
Indian tribes shall dwell securely. The Oregon
cgion must be opened to the adventurous and
nigratory spirit of our people, or the collected
lood must soon burst ovy, and sweep away the
Indian, to w limit we have pledged ourselves an
jndisturbed refuge in the home to which we have,
so humane a policy, transplanted bin).
The Senator regards this bill as going new and
langerous lengths. Yet the bills introduced with
the same object, long since, under Mr. Monroe and
Mr. Adams, by Gen. Floyd, were far stronger.?
They provided for the erecting forts and custom,
houses. As for that formidable and perpetual impediment,
the treaty, it existed then just as much
us now.
Adverting then to the English c lain if, as founded
on alleged discovery, .Mr. Linn treated the
pretended visit of Menrs and others to the mouth
of the Columbia as altogether preposterous. The
narrative itself, which describes a region bound uji
in ribs of ice in the month of June, malus it im.
x>86ible for any one now to believe that M ears'?
visit was to the Columbia?a coast never witness,
ng such regions of cold, even in mid.winter, and
mjoying a soft temperature even in the curliir
p-ing.
But, in truth, this whole British claim is recent,
it was never heard of as against the discovery of
Japt. Gray or the explorations of Iawis and
,'larkc. As late as 181:2, the question of our ?!is.
:ovcry was minutely examined in one of the
eadiitg British authorities on such questions, the
Edinburgh Review, and our claim admitted as in.
ran travel liblc.
As to what England may urge of the Nootka
Sound treaty with Spain, it issntUcieut to say that
any such claim must have fallen with that treaty
itscl", temporary in its character, and speedily
dissolved by the war which cccurred between the
two countries soon after. Our right he placed on
the strong and certain ground of discovery.
The Senator from South Carolina had urged
that we should, lirstof all, give the twelve mouths1
notice of our renunciation of the treaty, lie could
only answer that lie himself h id repeatedly urged
that eoursc in former years, hut always in vain.?
lie had ever been met with the answer: " This is
not the proper time?wait." Meanwhile the ad
verse English possession was going on, fortifying,
from year to year, the British claim and the Ilritisli
resources to make it good. Two successive
Presidenls had encouraged the hold and well-arranged
scheme of Astor to fortify and to colonize.
But we suffered him to he dispossessed, and the
nuclous of empire, which his establishment?
would have formed, to pass into the hands
of tho Hudson B ly Company, now the great in.
strumcnt of all the British scheme of possession.
The Senator insists that, by tiie treaty, there
should be a joint possession. Lie it so, if he will:
hut where is our part of this joint possession ? In
what does it consist or has it consisted ? We have
no post there, no agent, nobody to protect traders
?nay, in truth, no traders : for they are butchered
us soon as they appear there, cither by the British
agents, or those savages whom they can always
make the instruments of such systematic massacre
of adventurous rivals. Of the extent of these
murders, or of the regularity with which they were
employed, the Senator had prohahly but little no.
tion. lie could assure him that, before the year
lesxJD, there had perished in this way, as was well
ascertained, full live hundred men, and the yearly
slaughter has gone on ever since.
But what has ever been the history of your
peopling of these distant regions, always to he ilis.
puted with something which this Government
shrinks from encountering ! You have never
failed to turn your hack upon every such hardy
enterprise. The very navigation of the Mississippi,
for forty years, would have been yielded to
Great Britain but that it required the assent of
nine .States to bring it into the validity of a treaty.
Six Kastcrn States were ready to abandon it for
tn intirest the most wretchedly disproportionate.
If that mighty access to a new and greater cm.
lire of the Wist has been prcturvcd to you. it is
n spite of your Mipiiuness, in spile of your timidi.
y, in spite of your iui|>olicy.
As for me (said .Mr. I?.) I desire in this irresisti.
Jo advance of our popuiution, destined In carry to
lie very verge cf the continent the bene It's of our
roe laws, to march with every public right in the
;ad, while we carry to those regions of barbarism

ven in these great pnrjiosts-, halt rut her than to

tin; Senator from South Carolina, to oppose the i
' provision in the lull for fixed grants of land, in t
| all other particulars, he was was warmly in favor i
; of the hill, lie went on to cite the words of our ?
convention with Great Britain in ltfld, which
stipulated that " any country west of the Stony i
1 (Rocky) Mountains shall he free to both nations." <
Neither Government was, as a Government, to i
do any thing to divest the citizens of the other of '
the enjoyment of the common freedom of that t
country. Certainly if wandering subjects of cither
1 made, at their own risk, establishments there, t
j neither was called on to interfere. But we, by I
i this hill, do an uct to hinder some part of this tract I
from being uny longer open, except to our own i
' people. We take and urc to maintain exclusive
posse ssion, guarantying to settlers, uftcr five years' t
[ residence, a fee simple of the lands they may oc- }
i cupy.
Mr. C. here entered into a minute view of one I
j interpretation of the treaty, which might at first i
: have seemed possible?that either Government
j was to he at liberty to invite colonization. As,
however, no such view was advanced on the other
side as warranting our measures of occupation,
and as Mr. C. certainly showed how little any
sucli purpose could have entered into the treaty,
I or was practicable in itself, we need not follow
j his very skilful and elaborate argument on that
, point.
j He went on to urge that there had been no ap.
I propriation of territory until 1632, the country be)
ing freely used, on both parts only us a hunting'
ground; that the language of our own envoys,
; Messrs. Gallatin and Rush, inado it clear that
j they regarded ull occupation of the country for
J any purpose more fixed, as prohibited by the conl
vention ; that Rnglaiul has been equally guarded
in the sort of poss-.ssion which she allow ed her j
I subjects to derive? from her, limiting her licenses !
' to them, always to the right of hunting, and guard. |
I ing even in such licenses against all exclusion of '
our citizens.

I.et us then build forts : that is nortnilird liv :

j to our own.
! Mr. Linn answered briefly that the gentleman
was but reviving against land.grants, the very arI
guincnts used in 1821 against what he was now 1
' willing to admit, the erection ol' torts. Hut lite 1
j Hritish (Government, us a (Government, has never 1
built a fort tin re. Will it not object to our doing
j it ? :
j Mr. L. then gave vent to something of that in- 1
dignation with which he often sjteaks of the over,
bearing and grasping spirit of England, and the <
omnipotence and ubiquity of that little island. I'or 1 |
his pait, he did not intend to submit our rights en- j
; J tirely to the view which she might, in Iter policy,
1 take of them, lie did not intend to slop to eon.

! from which she is to work the lever of her looser j
; ' population, spreading itself out over your whole '
territory, and reaching to the very borders of vour
; .Slates themselves.
Mr. Me Roberts considered the provision to
which the Senators objected as a capital feature
of the bill. Citizens could not lie carried to the
country without the inducements there held out.
Hut the Senators from South Carolina and Mas.
! sachusctts have considered Croat liritain as oiler- 1
i .
I j ing us, in her conduct, an example of scrupulous
i forbearance to do any thing in contravention of j
j the subsisting treaty. Now, let the Senators con- '
suit the correspondence of Mr. lluskisson, and |
' they will there find that he pljuily says that
Croat Britain has authorised the settlements which i
| have been made, the posts which have been csta- I ,
blished, and that botli will be protected.
The Senator proceeded to aruue. with much !
. force, th:?t since the formation of the convention I
in which this territory was looked on as a common j
hunting.ground, an entirely different state of!
tilings had, by our long supincncss, come about.? '
It was a hunting.ground no longer. The game !
' former!}- pursued there for the sakr. of its furs has ' (
heen, by dcgrrcs, almost exterminated; and its, ,
chase no long< r warrants the scttlcnu nts original. J
' ly made for that purpose. Another mode of occu. j
J pan'y, with oilier objects, and looking to etationa. ' |
ry employments, has gradually ronic about. The ' ,
possess on now maintained by the English is ob. j
viously of a fixed character, because its purposes ' j
arc* no longer hunting and fishing, as of old. when I ,
1 i '
the convention was made. If they now occupy ' |
it, it cannot he for the. purposes of the chase, for v
11 io plain reason that lite ch.isc there lias ceased , ij
to ho vjlinblo. Vet tlioir settlements arc prow j
ing, iu*t in proportion an the clusc of the fur am- |
inuls declines.
The Senator from South Carolina line given a i
brief view of the several modes of claim alleged
| by ourselves and (treat Hritain in regard to tins |
j territory. Hut let him look, not to the vague al- |
legations of right, hut to such claims as can he j
| sustained in tin; in tit u 11 scrutiny of a negotiation, j
| Now, as to the rights which Hritain derives from | ^
Spain, Mr. Iluskisson writes, in 182<i, in the negotiation
with Mr. Adams, "Tito rights of H.itain
| in that quarter are defined hy the treaty of li'JII j
' with Spain;" and llicy embrace (ho further says j ^

n his Journal, in 179:1, distinctly admits Cap. i
uin CJray to have made the prior discovery of Uio j
noutli of the Columbia, which he himself had for j
ionic time completely discredited.
Kcciting. then, the words ol the convention, 1
Mr. Mcll. proceeded to nrgue that they would gjvc
Jreut Britain no reason to complain so long as
icithcr party attempted to dispossess the other.?
N'o man would be able, under this bill, to go upon
lie farm of u British citizen and appropriate it. j
In truth, Creat Britain has for ten years done
ill that you now propose to do. Hitherto we
lave slept over our rights, while she has been vigi- |
ant aud active. Let notice now be given that we
enounce the convention of lttlti. It will be a
nil twelvemonth bctorc our citizens can get tliitli.
r : the Lxcculivc will of course in the interval
jivu the proper notice to Croat Britain,
But, in reality, this bill will embrace every inlabitant
of the country, whether British or Amcrcan.
It can therefore dispossess nobody. IS'or,
in the other hand, do titles arise under it before ]
.he expiration of live years.
Ah to the enormous display of strength, which
we are told that she will malic in that quarter, 1
?cc no probability of any such gigantic ctlbrt.?
Two facts render it most unlikely : in the first
place, there is little or nothing there to tight for ;
and in the second, wo shall have nobody there for
her to fight.
Mr. Henderson, of Mississippi, succeeded Mr.
Mcltobcrts, in a short but exceedingly well.argued
speech, principally oil the question of mutual po*.
session and rights under the convention.
lis >1...... I lit.I lit., t.ol /? ' i I..... t llrlluin
Lending Iter jurisdiction over tlic country was a
real and practical taking of possession.
Mr. Choatc here interposed. Ureal Britain but
put in practice by her law Iter rights over her own
citizens, and assumed nothing else.
Mr. Henderson resumed. Suppose, then, a ease
where one of our citizens commits an assault on a
British inhabitant, will he not be. seized and tried
before a British magistrate? ("an you doubt it ?
No, her act of extending her jurisdiction over her
cm n subjects must either imply the absence of any
such legal equality 011 our part?in which ease
she lakes legal control and jurisdiction over our
citizens?or else it implies that wo too have tribunals
there, asserting our rights of jurisdiction;
which latter state, of things is at once a conflict of
jurisdictions, incapable of being reconciled, l'orls
we might exclusively occupy ; but it would be lieccssary
to beware of going out of them ? for who.
ever stepped abroad might fall within British jurisdiction
or encounter a British suhjeet.
It was clear that the convention looked to no
such state of things, and provided only for a free
trade of both parties to the territory. The acts of
the Hudson Bay Company must too, be held those
of the British Covenumlit. Its possession is her
possession. Her setting up a legal jurisdiction im.
plies that she takes possession of the country unless
we do the same. Un our taking that step, a con.
diet of jurisdiction ensues, which must at once
compel the adjustment of our linul claims of right.
She has asserted her right by these steps of possession.
We must do the same; and, by this hill,
we arc going no faster than she.
Mr. Bayard here proposed a modified provision
.is to grants of laud. But, before any fuillicr pro.
cccding, the Senate adjourned.

Snrelv such a state is, or soon will he,
able to pay its debts.
"The S'atc of Illinois contains 35,*
