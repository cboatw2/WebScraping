SPARKLING WATER.
A Temperance Ode.-Y.a. s. R.
'Bright spirit of the crystal wave
Thou living soul! my-lips to lave.
In thy clear, sparkling, cheering stream,
Refrehesas some heavenly dream.
Pure ! as thy own bright purity,
Thou tildest not iniquity;.
Buuimoral strength and vigor come
W'en thy cool surface laves the tongue.
Sparkling spirit of ths mountain!
Gushing dew of mossy fountain!
Thy diamond glance gives joy and health;
Ndr need thy vot'ry drink by stealth,
Nor siint the draught, but pledge again,
This goodliest gift of God to t en!
Bright, sweet, and pure, Thod hallowed thing!
We swear allegiance to thy spring.
A witness too Gi'God on earth,
We do not secem to know thy worth ;
Without thy ptififying" leaven,
'Tis wrinen Mai can't enter Heaven.
Emblem then of God'spure nature,
Let itsatisfy his creaftire..
Ch'arming. sparklIig, brilliaat water!
Crystals glancing, gem like daughter.
O Water sweet! and.Water bright!
We quaff thee with unmixed doli;ht.
Sweet beverage of the crystal spring !
Coimpared to Wine's infernal sting
How heavenly ! and all desire
En endered for that liinsiid fife,
Is sench'd in Waters living stream,
Sweetly we sleep, and sweetly dream.
Come drunkard ! tho' accursed to fame,
Thy thoughts be chang'd, be heaven thy aim!
Let Wonsan urge her gentle claim,
Uncliatiged'in aind, she loves the same.
Gladl she comes, with fond delight,
To gi~ qwater cool and bri ht.
She loves thee still ! 0 brie test best !
Thy bus}:asnd's pledg'd ad thou art blcsif.

Their ill paid love destroys his peace;

.Extraordinary Narraime.-T he Port
Hope (Canada) Gazette says: "Mr.
-Peter Moffat, who has for several years
*been. in the habit of teaming between
Peterboro,' this 'place and Coburg, states
that a team of horses which cost him ?75

was but little water at the time, he sus

he himself was taken ill and died and that

or well devised their scheme may be for a

The Curse of the Indian.-Thb Soneca
ludians of New York have addressed a let
ter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, in
which they acknowledge the justice of the
sentence and execution of Sanuel Mohawk
who recently suffered death for a murder
committed in Butler county, and deprecate
any harsh inferences which might be dra wn
in relation to the'charaeter of the tribe from
'he crime of one of its tncttbers, in con
clusion they administer the following calm
but severe rebuke to the "civilized socie
ty. ,,
"A nd whilst we feel no dispositin'a to
cast any reflection upon any oue,.yet we
must be permitted to express it as our opin
ion, that ardent spirits was at least one of
the causes of this dreadful crime coti'mit
ted by Samuel Mohawk upon your ienple
and that the article is made by-the whites
'and sold to our people, causing death to
hundreds of our young men and squaws,
whilst at the same time it hurts your peo
ple, and prohibit them from selling any
more to the Indians, and making then
disgrace themselves; and request that the
landlrods amongst your people, whenever
an Indian calls for whiskey, to hold back
his whiiskey bottle from the Indian's
fingers, for he is better off without whiskey
brandy, or any other spiritots liquors.
Please to do this we pray you."
The Tickling Trick.-Ou the day be
fore the Mass Conventiou took l)lae', a
crowd had assembled in one of the hotels
in Baltimore, and the discourse turning
upon pickpockets, a .gentleman present
placed his hand upon has side pocket, said
he kept his money there, and defied any
one to steal it from him. A few moments.
afterwards, this confident ge ntlaman felt a
strange tickling in one of his ears. Taking
his hand off the pocket containing his
funds.' he commenced rubbing his ear to
allay the titillntion, and just as he got
through the operatiou.a friend came up
and accolted him. At this moment lie
felt a tickling in the region of the pocket,
and placing his hand where his pocket
book should have been, he found it not.
He bad been tickle.] out of his vigilance
and his pocket book at tho same time. On
nvking a terrible noise, a police officer,
who happened to. hear his boast a little
while before, remarked with great cool
ness-"e Why, my dear sir, the tickling
trick is quite an old affair. The process is,
fur one pickpocket to tickle the car with
a straw, while a confederate obtains pos
session of the 'dumnmy,' as at pocket book
iscalled under such. circumstances."
Election Joke.-At the recent election in
this city, (seys the Worcester, Eng. Jour
nal) the.vote ofa well known gentleman
was challeuged by a young whipper-snap
per, who officiate.d; -and who knew that
the old gentleman differed in politics from
him. - It is necessary for.you to swear
that you have lived in this.ward tmore than
ten days,?' .said the challetnger. " Why
you know~that i have," replied the voter:;
",for mote thatn'ten niouths ago you came
to tpy shops and purch'ased the lint you
have on, and ncever paid for it yet."
Dotw on Matrimony.-Dow, Jr., closes
a sermon on kissing with the following.
qiiainta'dvice, comprising all the essentials
to wedded bliss:
'*J want you my young sinners, to kiss
and get -married, and then devote your
tipmito morality and money making.
Thenilet your homes be well provided
with. such comforts and necessaries as
piety, pickles, pots anid kettlejs, brushes.
brooms,. tienevolence, bread, charity.
cheese, crackers, faith, flour, affection, sin
cerity, ontiutns, integrity, vinegar, virtue,
wine and wisdom. Have all these always
onhatid, and happiness wsill the with you.
Don't drink nothiing istoricatiug-eat mod
erately-go about business aller breskfast
-lounge a little after dinner-char after
tea, and kiss after quarreling ; and all the
joy, the peace and the bliss the earth can
af'ord, shall be yours, till the grave closes
over you, and your spirits are borne to a
brighter and happy world.
Genius. gathering from Reality.-Tt has
been said, "that wye need to stifler to learn
to feel." And so it is, even in the sugges
tions of men of'genius.-GSluck [the father
of dramatic music] confessed that the con
ception,. "the grohind tone" of the noblest
passage in one of the nest operas, was the
voice of the public which we beard at Vi
enna crying~ to their Emperor for "Bread
breadh!" Here the power of seizing and
working into htarmony the out pourings from
ihe heart of a nation, the utterance of their
instincts, truer t han thteirrvenson, .the noise
of~a multitude, (thme low muttered thunder
of any voices) joined to an under current
of revenge, madly growling a deep pass
over the plaintive moans and wveeping of
anflictin conl onl,. b cninedtd eln
ecuted by a great poetic mind, andut
rough master of his art. Such a man was
Gluck, add Gluck's music will hearb.the
the strictest analysis, and enrapture the
most critical judgment.
Iron Stairnay.-We had the gratifica
tion yesterday of receiving another proof
of the ingenuity of our Baltimore mechan
ics, in the examination of a stsirway made
of wrought and cast iron. It is so con
structed as to take but little room, combin
ing lightness of appearance with great
strengthz. The carriages are of wrought
iron, as is also the railing, with the excep
tion of the uewells, or posts. which are of'
cast iron the top being an oval cap of the
same material. The brackets upon which
the steps rest are of cast iron, while the
steps themselves are of wood, firmly se
cured to the brackets by two screws; in
addition to the bannisters which pass
through them. The bannisters are three
quarter inch wrought iron bolts, and are
secured underneath the brackets, through
which they pass by iron nuts. The whole
is an admirable improvement Upont the
-great heavy a.lwkard stairw'ty generally
used in the stores and warehouses of our
merchants. It has been constructed in the
store of Mr. Thomas Mackenzie, No. 178
Bnltintorostreet, where it can be examin
ed by those desirous to examine it. It is
the first of the kiud, we understand, ever
made in this city. and is the work of Mr.
I. Devaltin, well known as an artisan of
the first class in his particular line of busi
ness.-American.
Pin Sticking.-A Boston papera tlas
that the pin manufactory near Derby Con
neeticut, has a contrivance forsticking pins
in papers, which irquite narvelliie. jt
takes iqEngland sixty females to stick in

whence they come out alf deat.Iy arranged
upon their several papers. The mechan

sous is daily saved yet temnins a mystery
io all but the inventor; and no person-but
the single one who attends to it is, updn
any pretext whatever, allowed to enter the
room where it operates. *,
important to. 'armers.-7At this sepsoit
of the year there is.,generally a process
going on in the manure heap,. the conse
quence of which is the abst-action-by vol
atilization, of the hest -and imost Valuable
part of the manure ! This-ev'olution- is no
thing more nor less than gaseous ammonia
-a principle of great importance to the
farmer, and which, as -it can easily be
er.onomized, he should never suffer to
escape.
The strong affinity of this volatile pro=
t'uet for sulphuric acid. is well knodin, and
hence, by:spreading gypsum or plaste- of
paris, ir.to -.whichs this principle largely
enters. upon- the floor of our tercorary, war
obtain a.solid compdund, wholly inoderous

Cold Affusion tn Poisoning by Prussic
Acid-At a meeting of English Chemists,
held at Sunderland, Dr. Robinson made
tha.e-Illowing experiment in. the presence
of his colleagues. He took two dlibbits,.
and poured on the tongues of each four
drops of Prussic Acid. The effect was
instantaneous. They fell down apparently
dead. He now applied the antilote. Cold
water, containing a mix-ture of saltpetre
and common salt, was pored on ;heir
heads and along the, spine. The fabbits
were instantly ressiitated, and in a few
minutes hopped about with thetr usual

POLITICAL.
[Br REQUEST .
From the HamburgJournal.'
TO OUR FRIENDS.1N S. CAROLINA.
Having noticed two communications in
the Edgefield Advertiser, of a late dap,
over the signature of "Carolina,' calling
on us for..an, tplanatioo of Mr. Clay's
principles on several ni akeis.we igel dis
posed to e~ipress them, in as few words. as
possible, least ..we should be considered
alarmed andntibwilling to sehd them forth
boldly and. above board. We. are Over
ready to divulge the principles of the man
whom we look upon, at this juncture, as
best calculated to fill the presidential. chair.
To you we address ourself. Courtesy
alone should have reminded "Carolina"
that he ought to have presented himself to
us in an original communication, and then
have published his questions in every pa
per in the Union, for aught we care. He
has refused to come ont like a gallant
knight, and break a lance with ue but
shelters himself behind the press, and un
der the guardiad arms of a faithful editor.
All that we desired was, to know whom
we were bound to answer ; yet this boon
has been refused. The editor declines
giving names; but assures us that the au
thorof "Carolina" is a gentleman of high
standing in society, of good moral char
acter ; and if lie is not very- much mista
ken, our private friend, athough-he may
differ with us in politics-ho is, in fact,
, gentleman in every sense of the word,
and one, he thinks. entitled to an. answer
upon any question.: Thereforo,;baving

irepared fir us, but he ought to be careful
lest he get caught in it first. The ques
tions proposed-;.re baitifanmiliar words with
efety *American, and we feel surprised
that a citizen of this~tate, especially such.
a person as "Carolina" is -represented to
be.idhoula..appear so unacquainted with
the principles of Henry Clay, when they
are. engraven upon the door posimsof every
house it} the: Unhed. States. To use the
language 'of 'one oi Virginia's sons--"he
has-done for himself what friendsaiid -for
tune can do for no man, and what neither
friends nor ibes can take from him-a
fame for which he himself has fought, and
from w4jch no man's censure can detract."
And that.fantsis his..reward-office could
not, add a cubit to his stature. He has
reflected honor on the 'place of his birth ;
he has maintained 'the reputation of Vir
giuia'paons, and Virginia is the mother of
heroe slatesen, and sages. - That is
enougl-for any man. But to our pleasicg
task. - '.
- Mr. Clay does not admit that Congress
bas-the con~stitutional right to i'ipose du
ties for the protection- of "- Northern Manu
factures alone, but says, letiglerpbe an
adequate revenue, with fair protection to
American Industry, whether it be of.-the

He-is not-in favor of the reception of

"The glorious 'Banner of out country

- "I have no. fears for the safety of the
Union;- whilst our liberties are preserved,
it is a tough and strong.cord, as all will
find who-shall presumptuously attempt to
break it." . .
-'Our Agricultural is our greatest inter

"The measure of the wealth 'of a nation
is indicated by the measure of its protec

" "Merchants, Mechanics, Traders, La

have 'no security - for 1permnanent -liberty."'
--#This 'Government .is to last, I trust;

Tnr. GLOBE, COL. BEN ToN AND Ma.
'CALUOUN.
Never, in the history of our Govern
ment, has such an attack been made upon
any public man, as that now going on in
the columns of the Globe.;. Ad. attack s0
unmanly, so ..unjust, vindictive, and mali
eious-so uncalled for by" any act of its
victiki, past or present-that the- whole
public, without disticetion of p.arty, are
struck with amazement at its ferocity, and
disgust for its authors. 'Everybody ' in
voluntarily: tisks, what has Mr. Calhoun
done; to call doin.ttpon him the concen
trated wratir of Mr.:Benton and the.Gilobe?
How has ho specially offended them, or
thwarted.their hopes.for the future:? That
it is their selfishiess,'aud no; their patrio
tism, that.is. alarmed, no one 'can doubt.
For it is one of the instincts of that mean
principle, to hate e.very one .whom it sup
poses an obstacle in their ay to the ac
complishment of its pnrposc. ' In what
then, has Mr. Calhoun -oftnded ? It is
known to all, that- for reasons deemed suf
ficient by himself, and unanimously ap
proved by his friends, he had voluntarily
withdrawn his name from the list of Pres
idential candidates.. lie had also resigned
his sent in the Senate. - lie had-retited
fromihe strife of politics, to the grateful
and congenial avocations of his farm.
His friends every where were merged with
the friends of Mr. Van Buren, in advoca
ting his claims, and in carrying the local'
elections throughout thedcountry. Whilst
in thi-r position;.hu.wss called upon by the
President to fill a'place- in his' Cabinet,
mede vacant by the stost appalling calanm

Tyler, as was .universally- understood at
the time', with special reference to the set=
lement of the Texas and Oregon questions.
it was known :that inutia:toy.steps had
been taken for the formation of a treaty
for the'a'dtnission of Texas into, the Union.
It was alr-. C~lhoun's ktoten feelings and
sympathies- an favor of~these, measures,
as' well as his high mural qualities and
pre-ominent abilities, thai pointed the Pre

tiniversal voice of approbation, from Maine~
to thosconfines of Texas- itself.: In form
