WEDNESDAY MORNING, OCT. 21.
The Pee Dee Agricultural Society In 1J
i's aeminnnual meeting on Friday of lust
week. The attendance of members was
good but there were few competitors for premiums.
If planter? wish to give interest
nnd spirt to the meeting* tlioy must tnkr
pains t? prepare for the exhibitions. 01
hog* only three were exhibited; but these
were worth exhibiting nnd would have be-n
admired even in Albany. They were a
Berkshire boar by Maj. \V. T. Ellerbe, and
n sow of the same breed, by Col. D. S. liar"
ll'i', with a sliole from her first litter of pigs
by tl?c her si le. Being without coinpetition
th-y of course took the premiums.
- Col. Marshall took the premium for the
best milch cow ; but without competition.?
Ho also took the premium last fall, and in
both instances with cows from the North
apparently of the Devonshire stock. Had
some of his last year's competitois brought
forward tin sime cows again, they might
perhaps now have been more successful;
that is, unless, their rows were starved or
frozen to death Inst winter.
The Secretary, we suppose, will in due
time, furnish us with an official report of
proceedings. We shall not further anticipate
him.
Aft r the exhibition of stock, a lot of rat.
tie sent down from York district were off rtil
for sal?-f and brought what wo considered
good price*. Among tl cm were threenulcli
cow* wi:h an A\res?1iiro cross from nn importation,
wV'Tal years sine*4, by the late
(Jen. I) ivi?*. These biowght 31, 37 and
60 dollar?, without their calves. The one
which brought $50 was 1 o years old; but
site was a b autiful cow and an extraordinary
milk- r. I was our fortune to procure
the most deeply crossed with the A \ resh re.
Tlic Hist milk we had drawn froin her when
skimmed, after, standing 18 houn, resembled
in appearance and taste, more a mixture
of fresh milk and cream than skimmed
ni ik. We have a half Durham, a good
milker; but her yield is mere milk and waltr
compared with that of the Ayreshir**. If
Ayrshire* generally ire like this, we advise
the lovers of rich milk to supply theinst-lvcs
'rom that s'ock.
Four half Durham calves, of the snme
ttock, aged from 6 to 9 or 10 months,
were sold at prices from $30 to $70. One
af llvw, a heifer Calf, 6 or 6 months old,
brought $50. They were splendid calves,
for their age. Two s:eers tliiee years old,
unbroken, brought $91.?
Alter this sale, a beautiful bull, with a
deep eross of the Devonshire, was sold by
f'oiv Mai shall and Dubose, to close a partnership
in him and was bought by ono of
the partners at $50. The best bargain of
Ire day.

Col. Campbell, in the Georgo Town District
Mr. Holmes, in the Charleston District. S. H.

Rkhlano. Election.?In District
there were two sots of os,njVKp^y<tr 'the Husk
of Reoreacntatircs *?Jthe contest was as anima
i it is not known for whom they wero cast. 1'
the same candidates arc still the highest on the
W, they are entitled to a decision in llicir favor;
J or if only a put of them arc still highest, the
I decision must be in favor of these. So oric is
| to be a lowed to take a seat as a representative
of the pcopla who<e election could possibly Irav.e
. been effected by votes known^and proved to'be
(illega1. And on the other hand, no one elected
' by the people to represent them, is tb be dchareil 1
I from his seat, merely because illegal* Votes were
j cast, when it w evident that if the jllrg il votes .
had not been cast, he would still have bach elected
by votes not called in question. Sow, in tl.e
i case b< fore us, if the 17 illegal voles be tikrn i
'I from the highest on the list, thut is fiorn the;
! Whig candidates, counting still (or the Adminit- |
, tration candidates all the votes cast for them, the j
numbers will stand thus; ,
Whigs GO 3, GO 2, CO I, f>92
Administration G03, 596, 596, 336
the four highost being three on the Whig ticket,
and one on the Administration ticket. It is . '
| therefore manifest that if the 17 illegal votes had j
! not been cast, tho three highest candidates on
; the Wing ticket n>Us>t have been elected by votes
j not now called in question ; and the managers
' ought therefore, most u iiquet.tioiiabIy.lo have so !
i declared. B c use tlie rights of legal Voters are
' net invalidated by the fact that a few men
! destitute of prmc p!o li tppan to voto tho i
j same ticket they do. Suppose that the majority
! of the three highest on the list, had been 500, j <
would their (.lection be invalid on account of the
1 |
! 17 illegal vot>s? Certainly not. And why I
I should it when the majority is smaller, so long j
1 us it is greater than the whole number of ille gal j
i votes? For u fiir majority <?f one vole cast for a
j candidate is as complete and unquestionable an
j election as a majority of ono thousand votes,
j Is Col. Elmore entitled to a neat as the fourth
I # '
* representative of Richland? If it can be proved j
that the 17 ilirgil votes wcro cist on the Whig
side, ho is us much so as Gen. Adams the high- j
est on the Whig list; for he received the same J
number of legal votes. But inasmuch an it is]
uncertain on which side tho illegal voles were j
cast there is just as much reaton for deducing
, thein from tho number received bv Col. Elmore
as from the number received by Mr. Wade; and

and Col. Elmore behind all the Whig candidal 8.
The uncort&inty on which wide the illegal votes
j wore cast renders it uncerta n whother it was
Col. Elmore or Mr. Wade who received the
| greater number of legal votes. U.doss therefore,
further discovery is mado in regard to the
ill gal votes, a new election ought to be ordered .
to choose a fmrlh representative by the district. *

New Jersey Election.
fn this stnte the strength of parties in the
J Lvgishrure stood lust year: Council, 10
i Whigs, 7 Van Bnren; Assembly, 33 j
Whigs, 20 V an Huron. Accounts have \
reached us from 11 outof 13 counties, wln< h '
g've the Whigs n gain of 3 Council incn and j
8 Assembly men. The Whig gain in the
the aggregate vote, since the Congression
al election in lft33 is 945. Tho Whigs
are very confident of carrying the slate for
Harrison in November. 'The Democrats"
ay thoy shall have a race for it. J i
Saice the above was in typo we have fu'l J
returns from N. Jersey. The State of
parties in tho Legislature tho same ns
above. The eggngate Whig majority
1115.
Eh c'ions were held last week in Pennsylvania,
N. Jersey and Ohio. The-*? have j'
commonly been put down among the doubt- |
ful States. The following is a statement *
of the strength of parties four years ago
and since.
Ohio.?At the Presid< n ial e lection in
1838, Ohio gave the Wing Electoral ticket
a majority ol 8457. In Ooctober of ifie {
same year, Vance (Whig) was elected
. Govemer by r niHjority of 601G. In 1838,
Wilson Shannon (V. B.) was elected Gov.
ernor by a majori y of573S ove r Vance.?
The Leg slature chosen in 183G was Van
Buren by a majority of 2 in the Senate and
i 4 in the House, In 1837 the tables were
i turned, the Whigs having a majority of 4
; in the Senate and 8 in the House. In 1838
[ the V. Buren men again came into power,
. having a majority ol 2 in the Scna'c and 4
? in the House. In 1833 they carried a mai
jority of 14 in the Senate and 24 in the
. House. The general impression is, that, a
great change bus taken place in the politi.
( cal views of the Ohio tns since the date of
the l ist election. The Cincinnaiti Gazelle
cla'msa Whig majority, in the S ate, of
( over 20,000. But it is not best to be loo
sanguine. The Senate consists of3G member*,'?House
72.
? Pennsylvania.?At the Presidential
, election in 183$, the Van Buren majority
,] was 4364. !n 1 38. Porter, V. B. was
*1M? gKTCgZMffi, J.aWUlLLBi 1
j ted as any which has occurred iti the Ft.it" since
' the djys of nullification. The following were
the candidates, \\ith the number of votes for
each; v z :
Whig: James II. Adams 620
Joseph A. Plark Cl9
James Tread well CIS
Thomas II. Wade 600
I
Adininis'raliion ; P. F- Elmore 6 3
W. F. D('S.>mssure ftO.'t

James Douglass 58G
la the Columbia box there were found, 17
j more ballots than liie number of voters; and the
I j managers, on that account, without declaring
i j any one elected, determined lo refer the m ;tter j
I to the House of Representatives for decision.
, ! The common, and evidently the correct rtilI
in deciding contested elections, is to deduct
j from the highest on the iist, the whole number of
; j illegal votes proved to have been given, when
_ P
chosen Governor by a majority of 9228.?
rhe Legislature in 1836 comprise*! h innjority
o' 49 Van Huron men in joint hallo*.
In '837, the VY bigs gained the Senate by 4
while in tlie House there was n V. B. majority
of 12. In 1838 the VVIrgi bad a
majority in'both Houses;' in the Senate
13.?in Assembly 4. Last year the e was
a V. B. majority ot one in tlie Senate, and
33intiio.llou.se. Tt?u S -nato consists of
33 members,?House 100.
New Jersey:?In 1836 New Jersey
chose Whig Kloctors of President, by h ma.
jority of 545. In 1838, occurred the disputed
Congressional election which has
created so much discussion in and out of
Congress. One Whip was admitted to he
c t o
elected: while on the otht r hand it was
claimed by the Van Buren inen that five of
iheir candidates were elected. Congress,
it is well known, dec d'-d in favor of this
claim. The vo!e however may he sei
down as about a tie. Last year, in several
<>f the counties, there was no conies'. The
Legislature in 183G comprised a V. B.
majority of 12; in 1837 n Whig of 23; in
1838, u Whig majority of 12; in 1839, a
Whig majority of 16. The Council consists
of IS members; the Assembly, of 53.
Each, county elects one Council.man, and
po more, whatcveer may be i'x population.
S pee the last election Hudson Qounty,
comprising Jersey Ci v and Bergen.: township,
has been set olF from Bergen County,
it sends one Assemblyman; Bergen County
two. Befora the division, Bergen sent
three Assembly.men.
Maryland Election.?The W'liigs have CO
i?i the House of Delegates and 15 in the Senate;
whib tho Van Burcn party have 1) in the firmer,
and 6 in t'<e latter; making a majority for
tho Whigs, of 51, on joint ballot. Tho aggregate
popular >oto gave the Van Huron party a
majority of 912 at the Congressional election las* |
year, whi'st the aggregate popular vote at the
recent election- gave the Whigs a majority of
2357, being a gain of 31G3.

In the 1st Congressional district, Charles

time for particulars.
This information wp obtain from an Extra

all the details.
The vo'o of Piiilml-lphia City for Gov. j
iernor in 1833, was 7603 for Rimer, and ;

ihe Whig majority was 2719. The V. B.
majority in the Sfate in 1838 was 9228; in
1836, 4364.

Oftho result so fnf the Journal of Commerce
says:
The Whigs have gained two Senators in
the distriet composed of Chester, Delaware
and Montgomery. They Imvc gained
four Assemblymen in Cisestnr County, and
two in Franklin. Th*y have lost a member
of Congress in the 3rd district, and
Inve perhaps goinej one in Burks.
The last Senate comprised 1G Whigs and
17 Van Buren ; the House, 91 Wings and
69 Van Buren men. In the new Senate !
thft Whigs will probably have a majority.

Preventive of Corn and Hay Stacks from
L'ghtning.?A simple preventive from i
injury hy lightning to corn and hay stacks is
that of merely pulling a broken glass bottle
as a cap on the point where the thatch termiates
in place of a spur or spiral- pinnacle
of re< d that is mos'ly placed at their summit
which is with thet.xcep ioi of iron the b?*t ^

rents of any country cannot tail, if carefully
epared, occasionally to interest or instruct I
le general reader, it is hoped our journal may
eel with a favorable reception from this I
lass while the former, to be without it, would
gue a degree of indifference, happily incon
stent with that Amor Patrie, so proverbially
laracteristic of our countrymen. fc
Emigration from Scotland has been so con. ?
nous during the last forty yean*, as to have
ven rise to a very numerous and important M
ass of the population of these communities ; s<
le which we cannot for a moment doubt, are d
r universally desirous of possessing, as they 11
-e capable of sustaining, a journal devoted to
leir national sympathies?an Independent
edium of communication with their native cl
nd; now the more desirable, as steam ni
ivigalion offers opportunities so frequent, ts
gularand speedy, of acquiring a knowledge
passing events?ere time robs them of their terest.
In this country, where the French, German p
id English population, sustain their respecte
papers?the publication of such a periodu
ll is a debt we ready owe to the honor of the |i
cottish nation and character; and the sub- it
jriber chiefl.y influenced by this conviction,
i preparing so desirable an object for his k
juntrymen, feels their patriotism will be his ..
rotection, while his anxioiy will be to present 1
tatter at all times pure and unexceptionable
nd worthy the high literary reputation of his
Duniry.
The Scottish Patriot will appear early in
341 neatly printed, in a form wel! filted for
inding?and wiii present a weekly retrospect
f general Scottish intelligence?a d g^st of 1
cottish literature?notices of new publica- -j
ons, &c.?of interesting movements in the ^
hurch?universities?courts of law?discovrirs
in science?progress in the arts?reports |
f deaths?marriages?bankrupticics, &c.?
nd interesting miscellany, gleaned from every
uurce?homo and abroad. " (
A piece of Scottish music will also be appen- (
ed, in such a manner as w>]] admit of its
eing separately bound if desired. The whole I
: is hoped, will form a journal equal in neat- I
ess and interest to any existing periodical. '
