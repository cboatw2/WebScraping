The Manhattan Bank in this city is slyly
resuming specie payments, on its circulation,
not on its deposited! It is a Bank ol itself',
and by itself and does not have the least influence
over, or connexion with, the other
Banks. There is not here, among intelligent,
practical men, any belief that the Banks can
or will resume specie payments for a longtime.

We have news from Liverpool to the 8th

ey market, or in a political way. The cotton
market is so-so. Mr. Spring Ricev has
brought forward the Budget. Of course, the
revenue falls short in England, as in this country,
for, when merchants suffer, the nation
suffers. The late King was to be buried on

the times is over. This true of England.
Gold is rapidly flowing from all ?juarters iuto

that the bank would have in its possession
about six millions of pounds sterling of

There are no more failures. Our good faith

We State for the information of distant

We occupy much space this week with the
engineer's report on the Cheftw and Waccanaw
Rail Road, but doubt not that it will interest
a majority of readers more than any
.lung else with winch we couiu occupy our
:olumns. We particularly invite the attention
of those who doubted the feasibility of the
judertaking, to examine the engineer's calculations
of the profits which the road is likev
to yield on the capital invested; which is
lie* only propper test of the utility of the proect.
A trunk was stolen froih the Stage 011 friday

rom which the following' is an extract.
Captain Jones was compelled to resign the
Vesidency, [of the U. S. Bank] and on the
ith of March, 1819, Mr. Choves took his
lace. In his exhibit, about three years aferwards,
Mr. Oheves stated among other
acts, the fraudulent discount and abstraction

Baltimore Blanch. while James A. Buchanan,

Security was obtained for.ab'out $900,000 no-,
ninally of this deficiency, but rcallv about
?500,000 only. By calling in all debts that
ould be made available, by a rigid contraction
f discounts and paper issues, and'by procurng
a supply of cash from abroad, Mr. Cheves
aved tlie Bank. But he continued his sysom

and manufacturers founil all their opeations

eductions made by the National Bank were
calculated at Seven Millions, and by the other
3unks at half as much. The price of land
hroughout Pennsylvania, fell at the close of

Mr. Clieves lias published ill the Charleston
Mercury a reply to this part of Dr. Cooper's
irticle and answers the charges implied in his
itatements. He shews that the Doctor erred
11 regard to the actual state of facts and
heir connection with the Bank; and closes hia
)ublication as follows:
If in the struggles of the Bank to be recharered,
my opinion was against it (as in tact it
vas) I nevertheless was silent. The relaions
in which I had stood to it forbade me to
nanifesc opposition to it, in any way or in any
legree. It is now no more, and I am free to
leclare that I am opposed to a National Bank
11 any shape. I always believed it to be un onstitutional,
and my experience and observation
have satisfied me that it is inexpedient,
mnecessary and dangerous.
The constitutional question lias been so of,cii

nvolved, (or at least none but mere consoliiationists
will deny that, it is) in the question
vhether or not a National Dank is necessary
md proper to enable the Government to conduct
the fiscal operations clearly enjoined tiein
it in the constitution.
That the State Banks are not the proper
igents for this purpose is now admitted by all.
Vone Avill deny that a U. S. Bank may be

iroperly restricted National Bank. On this
juestion the views ot Mr. Chcves would oe

Hie reputation which he acquired as a finan:ier
while in Congress, his experience and siglal
success in the management of the U.

1 The late gall.?We barn from the Wilmington

severe in that town and neighborhood. The
rice plantations were much injured, and from
the number of ship masts and other articles
driven on shore, it is feared that vessels have
been wrecked on the coast.- The gale was
j accompanied by an extraordinary fall of rain
which carried off the bridges and mills.
Since the resumption of specie payments
by the New Orleans banks, brokers are
drawing out their specie, to send to the North
for sale. The indignation af the honest part
of the community restrains, but cannot suppress
a proceeding so very disgraceful to those
who, in the circumstances, are engaged in it.

The sagacity of the President of the United

the following extract of a letter addressed bv
him to Sherrod Williams while he was a can didate
for the office which he now holds.
" I sincerely believe that the public funds

that the delay is owing to Uolatoochee's being

ily very sick; that the warriors have strict
3 orders not tire a hostile gun,. and as he cannot
have provisions here, asked permission to en1
camp at a pond 4 mile off and at the old agency

Our Indian. Affairs.?We learn by an express
which arrived hereon Thursday from
Gen. Jesup's Head Quarters, that information
. i had reached there that the Indians were as- i
j sembling in great numbers in the neighhor
hood of Fort. King. Tliey expressed nothing
j but the most friendly intentions as usual. Or"
j ders however have been given to the oom>
| manders of posts to be on the alert. It is
t | paid to be Gen. Jessup's opinion that they
, .contemplate an attack upon some point; he*
! has crone to Fort Kin?. Gen. J. lias ordered
' the purchase of horses and mules for the en-1
'i suing campaign. * . .

. The hate Gal j.?There are painful romors j
atloat of wrecks upon our coast, occasioned by !
the severe gale. Nothing havin'greached us, I

connected with the reports in question.

in case of the death of one of the parties the j

Twenty-Fifth, Congress,?As nearly as wc j
can ascertain by comparing the accounts of!
i j botlrparties, the numbers aslhus far returned,
stand 122 Administration and 114 Whigs.

, votes.
. In Alabama, three are to be heard from.
I In Michigan 1. When these are given in,
j it is believed the returns will be complete..?
I ! It would seem from present appearances that (

we doubt not, they will be found permanently C
useful as the most authentic, complete, and con- ' *
venient parliamentary record of our times, This 1
undertaking having, with these views, been lib.
eraly patronized by the public, it is our purpose to j
justify this early aud continued favor by increasing
the strength of our crops of Reporters at the
next fall and winter Session*, The faH Session
will be looked to by the country to settle alt j?'
that has been unsettled by the overthrow of the
system of Dcposites as established by Congress j
?the overthrow of the currency as established
by the Constitution?and the overthrow of the /
; system of revenue, both as a means of adequate ~ '
i supply for present demands, the inaintainanco of " i'
manufactures and the regulation of commerce.?
