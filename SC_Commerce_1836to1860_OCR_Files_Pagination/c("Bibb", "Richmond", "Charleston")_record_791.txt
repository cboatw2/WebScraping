necessary is much less then the estimate mentioned I
in the Circular of 1st May last; and if the contribu
tions be general, the sum of from eight to ten dol

that will be required.
To avoid the expense of addressing copies by
mail, the Committee adopt the public press, as the
medium of extending this circular, a mode which
the kindness of its conductors permits them to em
ploy, and which they trust will prove equally ac
ceptable. We am, with Christian regard,

Dear Brother Wightman.—Perhaps it may be
interesting to your numerous readers, but more
especially to your temperance patrons, to hear what
is doing for the temperance cause in Effingham
County, Ga. A society upon Total Abstinence
principles has been formed here, and has been in
existence for eight months. We think the Society
to be in a flourishing condition. All denominations
are united in the good work. But let us not be
misunderstood as saying that all denominations
approve of the temperance cause. Par from it, for
many professed Christians oppose this cause of God.'
When they are urged to sign the pledge their plea
js that they are good enough, and by signing the
pledge they sign away their liberties. Now we
assert that their excuse is insufficient, and we ask,
where is their religion, and their self denial, if they
will not give their names, and their influence to
arrest the progress of intemperance. We love to
see professors of religion act consistently.
Our Methodist brethren take an active part in
urging forward the cause of temperance. They are
proverbial all over the world for their zeal and
activity in every good work, and it will be strange
if the cause doe* not prosper in their hands. :
The Society has monthly meetings, and they !
usually occur on the sabbath, when a sermon is
preached, and addresses delivered suitable to the
occasion. At its meeting in August last, held at
Antioch Methodist Church, thirty-three signed the
pledge. The last monthly meeting of the society
was held at Ebenezer Lutheran Church, on the
Savannah river. A sermon was preached by broth
er Wright, and several appropriate addresses were
delivered. The pastor of the church earnestly
addressed the members of the church, and urged
upon them the necessity, and duty of encouraging
the temperance cause by signing the pledge.—
After every effort on the part of the speakers to
urge the people to this duty—only three females
signed the pledge.
The pastor is much engaged in the work and his
zeal has been repaid with bitter persecution, and
some persons have attempted to blast his reputation
both as a man, and a minister of the gospel. Yet
he perseveres. “The Lord being his helper whom
shall he fear.” May God open the eyes, and change
the hearts of all professed Christians who oppose
the temperance cause.
The officers of the Society are as follows—
Mr. Ephriam Kieffer a truly pious elder of the
Lutheran Church is the president—Rev. E. A.
Bolles is the corresponding secretary—and a re
cording secretary.
By order of the president, of Eff. T. T. Society,
E. A. Bolles, Corresponding Secretary.
Springfield, Effingham Ct. Ga. Sept. 12,1843.
N. B. The Society has under its care a Society

RUSSELL CIRCUIT, ALA. CONF.
Brother Wightman,—Presuming that it would
be pleasing to the friends of Zion to hear of the
prosperity of the church in this part of God’s moral
vineyard, as well as in all other sections, permit me
through the columns of your paper to say, that the
Lord has recently made a gracious display of his
saving power on this circuit, especially in the
village of Salem. At brother Story’s appointment
on Sunday the 20th of August, there was an un
usual seriousness manifested. At the 3 o’clock
service of the same day there were some penitents;
at night the number increased, and there seemed to
be such an interest in the congregation, that brother
Story, (who is the preacher in charge of this cir
cuit,) determined to protract the meeting, which
was done for ten successive days, and the result
was that God has visited this community in a won
derful manner. Penitents were found at the altar
by scores at each successive meeting, crying for
mercy. The result is, forty-three have been added
to the Salem church, and about as many conver
sions have been reported. Several of our local
brethren came to the aid of brother Story, and
preached with characteristic zeal. It will not be
amiss for me to say, that on the day that the forego
ing meeting commenced, I attended an appoint,
ment four miles west of Salem, (Shady Grove,)
where the power of God was manifest in no ordi
nary manner. I preached at this place again at
night, when we were favoured with a visitation as
in the forenoon. The church at this place has
been by this day’s services much revived, and I
believe every sinner present was suing for mercy.
Eleven persons were admitted on trial. The praise
be to God. There have been several other meet
ings on this circuit that would be as interesting to
our friends as the above; but I havo not the par
ticulars, and cannot give them. But let it suffice
to say, that God is doing great things for us, especi
ally in Salem, of which we are glad. Pray for us,
that the glorious work may continue to spread.
I remain, yours affectionately,
William S. Sharp.

WADESBORO’ CIRCUIT.
Brother Wightman,—The good cause is still on
the gaining hand in this part of the Lord’s vine
yard. We have just closed our Concord camp
meeting, where, it is supposed not less than one
hundred and fifty souls found peace in believing.—
One hundred and twenty-eight whites and sixty-two
coloured united themselves with the church. We
have had other meetings of great interest on the
circuit, of which I will not give you a particular
account. The whole number admitted on trial
since I have been on the circuit is six hundred and
thirty-one whites, three hundred and thirty-one
coloured ;—making in all 062, the most of whom are
young persons, in the prime of life. Although there
are some who have much to say about water, and
the necessity of following the Saviour down into
Jordan ; who take pains to teach that baby sprink
ling is a relic of Popery, still, in the spirit of St.
Paul, who said he wae sent not to baptize, bat to
fttach the gospel, we etrive to ley more street upon
the fire of the Holy Ghoet, than the water of Jor
dan: we preach a present, free, full, and eternal
salvation through faith in the all-atoning blood of
Christ. The holy influence ever connected with a
faithful preaching of these great truths, continues
to spread, and the work of the Lord is prospering
gloriously. The cause of Temperance is also on
the march. Your brother,

MISSIONARV COLLECTIONS.
Dear Brother Wighlman,—I Send you $72.25,
the result of the May collections on Walterboro’
circuit Below I give a list of the appointments at
which it was collected:
Buckhead, $1.25; Zion, 3.50; Providence 10;
Mt. Carmel, 5; Green Pond, 14; Peniel, 3; Is
land Creek, 3; Ebenezer, 9; Bethesda, 4; Wes
ley Chapel, 4.50; Mizpeh, 4; Walterboro’, 11.—
Total, $72.25.
There are some churches not named above, at
which we have taken up subscriptions, which will
be paid some time before Conference, and there is
some due on subscription at each of those men
tioned.
We are only sorry that we are not able to send
a larger amount Some of our people did the very
best they could, for which they shall be rewarded;
. others did very little, and some nothing at all. The
f great difficulty is, in getting all to give, and that is
all we lack. Many hands make work light We
are glad, however, that the missionary spirit is grad
ually reviving on this circuit. May it continue to
do so, until each.will feel, and act according to the
followiug sentiment
“Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small:
Love so amazing, so divine.
Demands my soul, my life, my all.”

IRWINTON DISTRICT, ALA. CONF.
Brother Wightman,—Please publish the pream
ble and resolution below. It is a copy from the
minute^of the Quarterly-meeting Conference for
the Irwinton and Glennville station, held at the
camp-ground near Glennville this day
Whereas, John E. P. Cowart, who has been a
local deacon in our church, and suspended by a
committee of local preachers, and while waiting
his trial before the Quarterly Conference, refused
to obey the rules of the church, by travelling about
through the country as a local Methodist preacher,
and has given us evidence that he intends to con
tinue doing so;—and we of the Quarterly Con
ference, having found him guilty of the charges
preferred against him, and expelled him from the
church: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Presiding Elder be requested
to send on to the Southern Christian Advocate for
publication, an account of his expulsion; that the
church in other places may not be imposed upon.

THE FREE SCOTCH CHURCH.
Brother XVightman,—I have from the beginning
sympathised with the seceding portion of the
Church of Scotland. I believed the connection be
tween that church and the State, an unhallowed
one, that the cause of God would be promoted by a
dissolution of such a union. But I wish to make
an enquiry or two, and if you or any of your corre
spondents can throw any light upon the subject
I shall be glad.
1. Must not the patrons of that church select
their presentees and candidates for settlement, from
those made licentiates and preachers by the
church, and thus declared to be suitable, in respect
to doctrine and piety, to preach the gospel 1 and
ought not a church to be satisfied with those
declared by itself to be competent religious
teachers 1 or
2. If the man had become unchristian in life, or
unsound in doctrine, subsequently to the grant of
his license, had not the church a disciplinary con
trol over him by which his errors could be correct
ed 1 Unless my mind can be relieved on these
points, I shall hesitate some time before I join
that church. H.

GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.
FOREIGN.
Latest prom Texas.—The steamer Sarah
Barnes, Captain Franklin, arrived yesterday from
Galveston. From the papers which she brought we
make the following synopsis of news :
The Texian revenue cutter Santa Anna, from
Matamoras, has brought despatches from Mexico.
Their contents are not publicly known, but it is
believed they give ground to anticipate a peace
favorable to Texas.
Col. Warfield has arrived at Washington, and
reports, that after following the traders some dis
tance on the Santa Fe road, he ascertained that
they had formed a junction with the army, and as
they numbered five or six hundred, and he had only
sixty men, he deemed it prudent to return to the
settlements, which he effected with safety. The
colonel expresses himself to be familiar with the
country in which the command of Col. Snively were
taken, and is satisfied that the troops were in the.
Republic of Texas. Col. Snively has also arrived
in Fannin county a few weeks since. He is about
to publish a report of the whole expedition.
The British sloop of war Scylla returned to Gal
veston, from Vera Cruz, on the 28th ult. She
brought, as is reported, depatches for the British
Minister, at Galveston. It is learned by reports
which she brought, that the Texian prisoners are to
be marched to the Rio Grande in a body, and there
liberated. We hope this may prove to be true, but
we have doubts of its authenticity.
The Commissioners who went out for the pur
pose of forming a treaty with the Indians, had not ■
been heard of for some days. It was feared the In
dians would play them false. They failed to meet
them in two places—at La Grange and Bird’s Fort.
The crop of Cotton on the Colorado and the Ca
ney is abundant.
The corner stone of the Wesleyan College, at
San Augustine, was to have been laid with Masonic
ceremonies, on the 26th ult.
Gen. Green, of the Mier prisoners, has returned
to Velasco, and is a candidate to represent Brazoria
country in tho next Congress.
A man named Thomas Wells, formerly a sailor
on one of the Texian naval vessels, was stabbed to
death in Galveston on the 25th ult., by J. W. Pi
lant, formerly a gambler at Houston. The parties,
it appears, quarrelled and fought about a bet of two
bitts at a game of cards. Pilant was arrested and
committed for trial, but was afterwards brought out
on a writ of habeas corpus, and admitted to bail in
the sura of $90,000—old Treasury notes.
Stephen Hard, who kept \,house of entertain- !
ment at the weat end'of the island, was shot dead
on the 26th ult, by a man named Toby.
Bishot Hughes in Ireland.—The London cor
respondent of the Journal of Commerce writes :—
“The Roman Catholic Bishop of Now York, Dr.
Hughes, has been making himself very ridiculously
prominent in the repeal struggle, having attended
some of the monster meetings in Ireland, and writ
ten a letter from London on the subject, which has
called down upon him the laughter of both repeal
ers and non-repealers. The times has pinned the
poor prelate to its broad sheet in the most merciless
mode of entomological impaling, and the gaudy
butterfly bishop, if it ever escapes and recovers
such insect treatment, will be very cautious not to
make a similar flight. You will not wonder at the
right reverend letter-writer being so transfixed,
after a perusal of his silly production, and I think
you will agree with the nearly unanimous feeling
here, that a more arrogant and ignorant, illogical
and ungrammatical, puny and puling piece of epis
tolary rhodomontade, never disgraced the pen of
mitred man.”
The Hudson's Bat Company.—The Montreal
Courier is about commencing a crusade against this
overgrown corporation. It opens thus
The Hudson’s Bay Company has, in every re
spect been a pest to Canada. It has robbed ns of
tne Fur trade, prevented for years the settlement
of the Saguenay, and crippled our fisheries. In
its transactions it has exhibited a disregard of the
laws alike of God and man ; and if its secret his
tory were given to the world, the horrors it would
unfold would make men’s flesh to tremble, and their
hairs to stand on end.
We have had opportunities of becoming acquaint
ed with certain transactions of this company, and
we may, at a future period, offer some remarks on
the state of the Indians and the Half-breeds in the
Hudson Bay country,—and also some specimens of
the mode in which the Honourable Company get
rid of the troublesome rivals who dare to compete
with them in the Fur trade.
The Jews of Berlin.—At a late session of the
municipal council of the Prussian capital, the
president of the body proposed a resolution concei
ved in these terms:
Considering the liberal aid Which the Jews of
Berlin have contributed, during the last four years,
to the different charites of the city under the
government of Christians, and consideringthatthey
nave amply supplied the wants of their own poor,
whereby a great saving of expense has resulted to
the people of Berlin, the municipal council orders
that the sum of two thousand dollars be appropria
ted, out of the city’s revenues for the current year,
towards the construction of the hospital which the
Jews of Berlin are now erecting for the poor of
their own faith. The proposition was adopted with
out discussion, and with unanimity, save one voice ‘
that of a Jew, who was a member of the council,
and abstained from voting.
Cuba.—How will the revolution in Spain affect
our neighbours of the ever faithful island! Will
they Bubmit to the new regime,—will they raise the
standard of Espartero,—or, availing themselves of
the revolt of their mother and mistress, will they
no longer acknowledge her paternity, and for the
first time make the experiment of self-government1
We rather think they will continue their colonial
dependence, and subscribe themselves, like subser
vient letter writers, whoever may chance to be in
the ascendant, respectfully yours.
By the way, it is said, in the last accounts from
Spain, that Gen. O’Donnell is to be appointed Cap
tain-General of the Island of Cuba, vice the pres
ent Governor, Gen. Valdez. From this we should
imagine that the latter is of the Espartero party.
He has great influence with the army in Cuba, and
should he exert it against the Christian party, he
could certainly wrest Cuba at least from their con
trol.—N. O. Picayune.
0’Connell’s*Pay, or Rent, which has excited
some inquiry in this country, is thus explained by
the Newark Advertiser:—When he was first elec
ted to Parliament, in Clare, his practice at the bar
is said to have been worth ten thousand pounds
sterling (fifty thousand dollars) a year. As an
M. P. he gets no pay, and in order to enable him to
support his family, then numbering ten children,
from twenty-two down to eight years of age, and
devote himself to the public service, his country
men instituted a fund, to which every Irishman
would have the opportunity of contributing his por
tion. One day was set apart for this collection ot
the fund, which, a member of the Dublin Repeal
Association writes, has frequently reached seventy
thousand dollars annually. It has been as low as
fifty thousand dollars only twice. Pretty good pay
for public service, certainly.

French Finance.—The national debt of France,
which in 1572, under Charles IX., was only 17,000,
000f., was in 1832, 5,417,495,017f. At the present
time it is almost 7,000,000,OOOf, France has already
been bankrupt 6 times, viz. :—Under Sally, who
Jeducted the interest formerly paid on the capital;
at the end of Louis XIV.’s reign, under Desmeret,
who paid neither capital nor interest; at the fall of
the “ systbme Law,” under Lepelletier; under the
Abbe Terrai, who did not. pay the assignments;
luring the revolution after the creation of 45,000,
TOO of mortgages; lastly in 1799, by the reduction
af two thirds of the debt.
A Barrister Posed.—At the late Limerick
assizes, a witness of the “ lower classes” was cross
axamined by Mr. Bennett, Queen’s Connsel when
:he following dialogue took place :—Counsel.
Why do you hesitate to answer me; you look at
Tie as if I was a rogue 1 Witness : To be sure I
lo. (Laughter.) Counsel: Upon your oath you
:hink me a rogue I Witness: upon my oath I don’t
:hink you an honest man. (Continued laughter.)
Counsel: You swear that on your oath 1 Counsel:
Now, why do you think sol Witness: Why, be

myself.
Uniform Postage.—The Globe says that nego
tiations for a post communication, like that with
France, have been concluded by the British Govern
ment with Belgium, Holland, Austria, Saxony, Prus
sia, Sweden, Norway, and Russia ; the postage to
tie uniform, and pre-payablo or not. France is ar
ranging similar treaties with Switzerland and the
Italian States. Prussia and Austria have adopted
uniform postages within their own territories.
Important Movement.—The merchants of
Liverpool are making a most important movement
ust now, and are likely to induce the government to
iccede to the adoption of a measure which will be
lighly advantageous to the commerce of the port,—
lamely, to allow a drawback on the duty paid upon
mported cotton whenever it may be required for
jxport.
It appears by a return ordered on the motion of
Colonel Verner, that no less than 137 of the nation
il schools in Ireland “ have beon erected, adjoining

DOMESTIC.
—?—
{Reported for the Southern Chri.tlan Advocate.)
State of tbe Charleston Cotton Market.
Tuesday, September 19, 1843.
There is quite an active demand this day for Cotton—
prices ranging from 6c. to 9c.—chiefly at from 6| to 7|
and 8c. One lot sold on Saturday at 9}.
The demand is solely for domestic consumption. The
foreign demand will not likely commence until the new
crop comes in freely. Planters will do well to hasten for
ward their crops.
Cotton.—The cotton crop ot 1842 was the lar
gest ever raised in the United States. It amounted
to 2,400,000 bales. The crop of this year is esti
mated at about 1,700,000 bales. A strong probabil
ity exists that Cotton will rise materially; especial
ly when it is considered that the crop is four or five
weeks later than usual, and in danger of being cut
off by frost.
The Southern Quarterly Review.—We
have just risen from the perusal of the last number
of this noble periodical with impressions of the
highest edification. The Southern Quarterly Re
view is doubtless a title with which but few western
readers are familiar. Its fame has not reached this
region of Union to any extent. But we hope to see
the day when its high merits will be extensively
made known to, and its valuable text be attentively
consulted by the reading portion of our citizens.—
The Southern Quarterly was commenced some
eighteen months or two years ago in New-Orleans,
and about a year since its publication was transfer
red to the City of Charleston. It is sustained by
the genius and learning of all the Southern literati,
and reflects in living splendor the efflux of that glo
rious constellation of mind that illustrates the fame
of the great bulwark of Southern rights. The name
of Southern Quarterly Review may be ominous to
some of sectarianism and bigotry. But such is not
the character of the Review. It is characterized
by the most exalted liberality, and bears no impress
of the passionate temper with which the ardent
sons of the South usually urge their views and as
sert their rights. In fact it is exclusively a literary
periodical, and in the discussion of political subjects,
treats them not in the spirit of the partisan or sec
tionist, but in the calm and unbiassed view of the
philosopher.
The number before us contains many very able
and interesting articles, reviewing the most impor
tant literary productions of the day, and discussing
their merits as well as the topics of which they treat
with excellent force and effect. The Southern
Quarterly Review is designed to be the organ in
the department of periodical literature of the prin
ciples and views which peculiarly distinguish the
people of the country south of Mason & Dixon’s
line. But while it will prove an efficient defender
of Southern principles, we are assured by the tone
of the numbers, so far as we have seen them, that
it will not descend from the high ground of literary
and philosophic research to enter the field of parti
san controversy. We esteem this an honour to
American literature, and we recommend it as wor
thy the patronage of all who seek for entertain
ment and instruction in the periodical issues of the
press.—Kentucky Yeoman.
Our Rail Road.—A novel and interesting sight
was witnessed on Saturday afternoon, on our rail
road. The arrival of one locomotive with a train
of 72 cars, all loaded, and forming a line of very
near a quarter of a mile. The weight of the whole
amounted perhaps near 340 tons. The locomotive
is a new one called the Camel, three of which have
been built by Messrs. Baldwin and Whitney, in
Philadelphia for our rail rord. It is expected that
1500 bales of Cotton can be brought in one trip by
this powerful engine. The other two are shortly
expected, and will no doubt hereafter greatly ex
pedite the transportation both up and down on the
road.—Charleston Mercury.
St. Louis.—This city, favored by an excellent
site, and inhabited by an active population, is rapidly
increasing. The Republican states that during
the year past, five hundred buildings have been
completed, and with but few exceptions they have
all been built of brick. Upwards of three hundred
buildings are now in progress to completion, sixty
of which are stores, ana among the rest are the
Tobacco Warehouse, being erected at the cost of
the state,—Col. Brant’s Tabacco Warehouse,—a
new church for the Catholics-2-another for the
German Catholics, and another named the Metho.
dist Centenary Church. A number of ranges of
dwellings to be built in very handsome style, are
also in progress.
The Mississippi River.—The St. Louis Re
publican states that, by an admeasurement and calcu
lation lately made, it was found that the quantity of
water flowing in the Mississippi, opposite that city,
is 112,350 cubic feet per second, of which 70,800
feet flow on the west side of Bloody Island, and
41,550 feet on the east side. It was *also found
that the greatest velocity of the current is on the
side of Bloody Island, where it flows on the surface
at the rate of eight feet per second, or five and a half
miles per hour. The greatest depth of the river is
twenty-five feet, and the shallowest part, in the
continuation of Vine street, is fifteen feet Mean
depth about sixteen feet
A New Invention.—Mr. Abram Marble of Illi
nois, has constructed a “ carriage to be propelled by
wind, for the purpose of carrying heavy burthens
and breaking prairies, and the like.” The paper
in which a notice of this invention is made, states
that “those who have examined the model believe
it may be made useful in level parts of the country,
and stato that it is quite a simple and ingenious in
vention, as the carriage may be made to run in any
j desirable direction, no matter from where the wind
may come. It is also represented as being well
fixed, so as to guard against the effects of sudden
gales of wind or storms.”
Silk Manufacture.—The New-York Express
says that the Patterson (N. J.) Silk Manufacturing
Company are manufacturing Sewing Silks of every
variety and colour, cheaper in price than those from
Italy, and superior in fabric and durability to those
imported from any country. Silk Shawls and hand
kerchiels are produced at this factory, which are
remarkable for their beautiful colour and superior
workmanship.
Robbing the mail.—The Richmond, Va., Com
piler of Tuesday last, insinuated that there is some
rascality afloat on the mail route between that city,
Milton, N. C. and Danville, Va. A double letter
came to the office at Milton from which a check for
$127 had been extracted, and several letters broken
open have come to the office at Danville.
PROSPECTUS
OF THE
EPISCOPAL PROTESTANT.
A Weekly Religious Paper, to be Edited in the City
of Charleston, S. C,
BY \VM. H. BARNWELL,
Rector of St. Peter’s Church.
It has long been thought by some, that a Weekly
Paper, of a decidedly Evangelical and Protestant
tone, is called for among the Episcopalians of our
Diocese,—and the present is conceived to be no
unfavourable time for establishing one.
Whether from a correct, or mistaken sense of
duty, the undersigned deems himself called to as
sume its Editorial supervision. Emolument is, in
no way or degree, the object of the publication,
and should the avails be more than adequate tomeet
the ex(>ences, they will be appropriated to Mission
ary purposes. The object will be to diffuse and
inculcate through the Press, those vital truths of
the Gospel, which have ever been, since the begin
ning of the Christian Dispensation, the means
made use of by the Holy Ghost, for advancing the
Glory of God, by converting and sanctifying souls.
That these truths have either been avowedly re
jected, or virtually obscured by the Church of
Rome,—few Protestants are in the habit of ques
tioning. That they have been undervalued, if not
despised bv the advocates of that system, known as
the Oxford Theology,—is by many conceded,—and
that they are, to a great extent shorn oT their beaU
P"™’ ^ jndistinet manner In which
they are brought out, by w,y prof.^edly Ortho.
d°x,—la painfully felt Our am,, then will be, to
set forth, in distinctive contrast, with ro^oaniarn(_
Oxfordism,—and a questionable orthodoxy,— *Wg
Doctrines of Grace, as they are declared in the
Holy Scriptures,—and were held and taught at the
Reformation. To promote God’s Glory, and Man’s
best welfare, by upholding Truth, and breaking
down Error, we conceive to be the dutv and privi
lege of every enlightened and sanctified mind,—
and it needs no argument to show, that the power
of the press, is an important auxiliary in this object.
Nor will it be deemed beyond the province of an
officiating presbyter to assume, upon his own re
sponsibility, the duties of an Editor when it is re
membered that at his Ordination, he engaged, “The
Lord being his helper,—to be ready with all faith
ful diligence to banish and drive away from the
Church, all erroneous and strange doctrines con
trary to God’s Word.”
In conducting the proposed Journal, while the
entire and exclusive Editorial responsibility, rests
upon the undersigned,—he expects important as
sistance from a number of Clerical and Lay Breth
ren, by the way of communications, ~
But it is to
be one decided feature of the planthat each wri
ter will be strictly responsible for his contributions,
so that personalities of all kind, and secret insinua
tions, and anonymous assaults which too often dis
figure the columns of Religious Periodicals, may be
wholly avoided.
The Spirit of the paper, while firm and decided,
will, it is hoped, prove thoroughly Christian—glow
ing it may be, with the earnestness of a fervent zeal
for the Divine Glory,—but yet tempered with kind
ness and candor,—in short that spirit, of true love
for God and man, which the Holy Ghost, sheds
abroad into the hearts of prayerful and watchful
believers.
In controversies, should they occur,—the effort
will be to keep in view principles, and not men,—
and they will be conducted it is hoped in that fair
and courteous manner which becomes the dignity of
Truth, and the holiness of the Gospel. We shall
use with all the ability God has supplied, or may
supply, the best arguments within our reach, to con
vince our opponents,—but we shall rely upon the
influences of the Holy Ghost, applying His own
Truth, to effect this result, and if success crowns
our efforts, to Him, with the Father and the Bon, be
the glory all ascribed.
