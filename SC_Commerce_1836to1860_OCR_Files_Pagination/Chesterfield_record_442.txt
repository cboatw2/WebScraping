Editor of the Kentucky Fanner acknowledges
the receipt of a Hanover turnip
weighing 9 lb.?two sugar beets weighing
19 and 19 1-2 lb.?a turnip weighing 4
3-4 lb.?a pumpkin weighing 75 lb.?an

the grains half an inch wide?another
with grains nearly an inch long, and
another still with 31 rows and 53 grains
to the row, in all 1972 grains on the ear.
A Kentuckian informs us that of three
competitors for a premium offered by an
agricultural society in Jessamine county
Kv. one had produced 150 bushels of!
corn to the acre, one 197 bushels, and a |
third 209 bushels. The last named had t
a field of 25 acres, all equal or nearly
equal to the acre from which 200 bushels
had been measured.

of all classes of my countrymen to acquire f
a fund of information which will guard 1

of society, constitute its physical power ]
and possess more than an equal share of ,
its virtues, I wish particularly to address j
myself in the hope of inducing them to

We copy the following interesting article
from the St. Louis Gazette of the
21st ult.
The two cities of the United Sttes which
are progressing most rapidly in population
and wealth, at the present time, in proportion
to their size, are undoubtedly Boston
and St Louis, one in the Eastern, the other
in the Western section of the Union.
For many years?from 1800 to 1830?
Boston was losing ground, in the race for
greatness with New York, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore ; but about the year 1830 a
new era dawned on that city, through the
instrumcnrality of its enterprising capitalists,
which has turned the tide strongly in
its favor. At that, time, the first railroad
was constructed on one side of the city,
and the first steam-power loom establishment
erected on the other. From that
time to the present. Lowell has increased
in'population from 300 to 20,000 and in
wealth from $100,000 to 20,000,000. The
cotton manufactures of Lowell, and the
hundred other manufacturing villages in
New England, have given a stability to the j
trade of joston unknown to any other city
in the Union.
Massachusetts, formerly exporting,
it was said, nothing but granite and ice,:
* " ? i i I
now produces manuiaciurcs vaiueu ai
ninety millions of dollars per annum, a l
large part of which centres at Boston, as
a place of distribution to all parts of the
Union.
At a later period than that first men.
tioned, her far-seeing citizens became
convinced that, although she had no river
like the Hudson, the Delaware, or the
Susquehanna, to bring to her wharves the
products of the boundless and fertile West,
yet that an iron pathway might be laid
along her mountain gorges, over which a
jteain-engine with a train of cars could
move at the rate of thirty miles per hour,
taking the produce of the lakes at the outlet
of the New York Canal, and landing it
it Boston in less time than it can be dcivercd
at New York. About one-half of
his road is completed, and the whole will
>e finished within twelve months from this,
ime.
This road will cost not far from seven
nillions of dollars. It is calculated to
mpport an engine of fourteen tons weight,
? /\a/\ i i r a __
ind to carry i,uuu Darreis 01 nour in u
tingle train of cars ten miles an hour. It
s estimated that when finished, flour can
>e transported from Albany to Boston, 201
nilc s, for 30 cents per barrel. Two thou,
sand men are now at work on this road,
n some sections, both night and day.
The capitalists of Boston have also contributed
largely to the funds required for
laying down railways from Albany to
Buffalo between which places there will
>oon be a continuous line completed. The
same enterprise and capital will ere many
fears shall have elapsed, continue the
same line across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,
to St. Louis, incase the fundsrequi cd
for the work arc not furnished by the
states on the route.
St. Loui3 owes its present prosperity to
neither manufactories nor railroads, for it
lias scarce a dollar expended in either.
Its progress has been acclcrated mainly
by the hundreds of thousand of immi- ]
grants who have over spread the prairies of
Missouri, Illinois, Wiskonsin, and Iowa?
who have come here for the sale of their
agricultural and mining productions, and
for the purchase of merchandise. The
increase of this city in wealth and popultion,
within the past ten years, is scarcely
paralleled. In 1831 the population of the
city and suburbs was estimated at 6,000.
It is now not far from 30,000, and rapidly
increasing. The number of buildings recently
commenced is very great, and the
value of those in course of completion will
exceed a million and a half of dollars.
The trade between this city and Boston
is greater, and the connexion more intimate,
than is generally imagined. The
various staple articles of export from
Bast on, including domestic goods, boots
and shoes, oil, candles, &c. required for
this market, and which arc forwarded
from here for the upper country, cannot
fall short of two millions of dollars.
Wc shall close these jemarks with a
comparative statement of the value of
Western productions shipped from NewOrleans
to New York and Boston.

ENGLISH MINES AND MINING.
NEWCASTLE-rroN-TYNE, AUGUST, 1840.
That nian must be insane who shoul J
write a letter at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
about any thing but coal. He has but
one idea?coal! One thing fills his vision?coal!
Coal is the standard of value,
and coal dust the circulating medium.?
The houses are built of coal. The streets
are paved with coal. The inhabitants live
on coal. The children look as if they
were made of coal, and even the white
clouds are black !
What a wonderful region is Durham
and Northumberland shires? The whole
country is undermined. Buildings arc
erected 700 and 800 feet below the suri
face of the earth, and streets and railways..
I . m
running for miles in all directions, are
daily traversed by thousands of human
beings. Newcastle with its population of
60,000, stands on the crust of a subterranean
city. Some of its houses have sunken
their foundations in consequence of the
I yielding of the ground beneath. The River
Tvne, as large as tho Thames at London,
floats its commerce over these vast

places on the coast, the ocean rolls its
waves over the heads of the miners. The
cheif wealth of Durham and Northumberland
lies hid in the bowels of the earth,
where a very considerable portion of the
inhabitants pass half their time. The
coal-pits open their black mouths on every
hill and in every valley. They may be
distinguished far off by the towering enginery
erected over them employed in
raising the ccal and water from the depths
below, and the piles of the former which
lie around in hillocks waiting to be transported
to market. The country is lined
with railways?more abundant than hedg<
-rows?used in "carrying coals to Newcastle."
At every half mile, you meet
with the little villages of the pitmen (as
the labourers arc called.) The snug brick
cottages are arranged with regularity and
taste?each having its petit grass plat in
front, usually decked with flowers, and its
vegetable garden and fruit trees in the
rear: What a contrast between these
smiling though humble abodes, and the
dismal caverns where the villagers spend
nearly their whole conscious existence !
Great labor and expense attends the
sinking of the shaft of a coal mine. The
exact location of the strata must be ascertained
by boring before the excavation
commences. This determined, you know
not what obstacles vou may encounter
from veins of rocks or streams of water in
your descent. And, then, the destruction
of human life almost invariably incurred
in these perilous enterprises! the gigantic
nature of which may be inferred from
/%. 11 ?
the tact that tnc snaits are generally suiik
to the depth of 600 or 700 feet, and sometimes
to 1200!
Political Abolition*.?It is calculated
that James G. Birney, the Abolition
candidate for the Presidency, received
about 400 votes ia Ohio, and about 500
n Pensylvauia. In this city he received
170, and the State at large inclding the
city perhaps 1000. We think it possible
he may have received in the whole country,
an aggrlgate of 5000 votes.

drop fell, and the rope broke. The cord
was doubled, and just as the officer was
preparing to strike away the drop, the
wretched man asked for a little time to
make an open confession of his crime.?
It was granted. He confessed his guilt,
and was hnng.
Philadelphia, Nov. 1G.?The short
of an Earthquake in Philadelphia.?We
were visited on Saturday night between 0
and 10 o'clock, with an extraordinary
storm, accompanied by heavy thunder and
vivid lightning. Shortly after 9, the
buildings in various parts of our city, trcmbled
and shook for several seconds, as if
through the agency of an earthquake,
Many of our citizens were alarmed, and
the pause which immediately succeeded
the shock, especially to those who were
situations of quiet and repose, calcula
fully to experience the terrible sensati
was marked by a feeling of awe and
lemnity. We have since been inforrr
that the waters of the Delaware were a
tated by a heavy and unusual swell at I
same time.

killed and wounded were deck passeng<
and some of the crew. The whole of t
cabin passengers, and the captain a
clerk escaped uninjured. The head enj

Since the above was written we ha

The clerk of the General Brown infori
us farther that six men died immediate
at the time of the collapse?that sevente
died next day, and there were some fifte
or sixteen others whose lives were despa

The captain was asleep at the timet
fatal explosion occured, and it is said
some of the surviving firemen that the j

Theory of the Wind?Wind 1
been explained in the following mann<
Heated air has a tendency to rise, a
! cold air rushes in to supply its place.
Thus the heated air of the equatorial re
ons rises and gives place to a current s<
from the polar regions, which is a proc
! that serves to equalise the temperature
| the world. But the polar countries lyi
1 near to the axis of the sphere, the air fr
! those regions has not received so mi
motion as about the equator, or great
j distance from the axis ; whcrciorc, 11
rives at the equator where the motion of
1 earth is greater. If it had no motion
fore, on cast wind would be the con
: quencc, and the force of that wind be, as
1 difference between the motion of the ea
j where the air came from, and that wh
J it arrived ; but then it has a motion to
south ; for it is rushing into a vacum 1
the air which rises; so that the wind *
not be from the cast, but north east a
the namber of degrees 'north of the e
i from which it will blow will depend uf
the comparative force of the current of
from the north to the difference betwt
the earth's motion at the equator and
the polar region, from whence the
comes. As there must be a correspoi
ing efflax from the equator higher up, i
cording to this theory, the wind should
cry where be northeast or southwest, 1
j it blows in very difierent directions
different limes and places : and this pro
blv uepends on the variations in tcmpe
turc at different times and places.
Strength of Iiion Pillabs.?At I

Glasgow, a paper was read by Mr. IIo<

onts made by him on the strength of ii
pillars. It appeared from these, thai
pillar, square at the top and bottom,
about three times as strong as one roum
it the ends ; that if the pillars are not p
ccd perfectly perpendicular, at least t
thirds of their strength is lost, and t!
they arc one seventh stronger when sw<
ed in the middle, like the frustrum ol
cone, with the base in the centre of i

A Discovery.?Some three or f
