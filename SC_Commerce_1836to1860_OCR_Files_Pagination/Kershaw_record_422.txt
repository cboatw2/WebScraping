Clarendon, Sept. 1, 1610.
To John A. Stuart, Esq.
Deur Sir:?I received yours this morninor
and hastily ciimnl.. I
0) / uuii j wui iiioiiuly
suggestion, to allow the use of my name
and authority, to correct some of those
numerous misstatements of my conduct
aii'l opinions, which have appeared ill so
many anonymous, communications in the
Press. From the pause which a short
time since intervened in the discussion ofi
the Gubernatorial election. I ha.I I
that a tone of moderation and good temper,
which ought to prevail on all occasions,
and which has hitherto prevailed
on this subject, would characterise the
remainder of the Canvass. But in this I
have been greatly disappointed. Accusations
of supporting the " Proclamation and
the Force Bill" have continued to be alleged
against me, without reason, and
without proof?while anonymous appeals
to define my'part ami present position,
would show that all the usual devices of
crying and hunting down a man, have
been pit^in full,am! active requisition. In
the same spirit I have been charged with
having been opposed to the Independent
Treasury System, because I voted with the
majority of our Delegation in Congress to
postpone for a few weeks the further consideration
of a very in perfect Bill, with a
view in add those salutary modifications
which it has since received, and which
the abrupt termination of a short session
of six weeks, and the protracted discus- (
sions of the opposition, allowed no oppor- (
tunitv at that time of introducing. Hup-'
pily for my justification, my approval of ,
the objects and principles of that measure,
new and startling as thev were to many .
others, was well known to a portion of
my colleagues?to the administration it- |
self?(and above all, to my constituents) to ,
have been as derided then, as it is now; j
and the open and zealous manner in which
I deemed it my duty to advocate it before |
ihc People I had the honor to represent, }
places rny opinions on that subject beyond ,
the doubts or insinuations of any man. :
I will not affect insensibility to accusa- .
tions of this kind, unjust and ungenerous ,
as they may he; and I trust never to arrive /
to that slute of " stoical perfection," in
which I would feel indifferent to the man- .
ner in which my conduct and principles |
were estimated or discussed, by the People ,
of South Carolina. Neither do 1 com- l
plain; or if I know myself, would I wish r
it to be otherwise.
If by such means, the State shall be s
enabled the better to choose her Chief a
Magistrate?the gain will more than coun- a
terbalance the inconvenience or pain in- ;
dieted in the canvass, on any of her citi- 0
zens.
If I understand the drift of the Policy v
of those who arc,?o elaborately criticising* j
my past political .course, it is, by a\viiKe-[
nirig up the bitter feelings which mice divi- j
Jed end agitated the Sute, to use them to t
my disadvantage. Were the consequences
i)f this appeal to old party prejudices, to
be limited to this comparatively unimpor
tant object,?I should have but little objeclion
to urge. But there is no rule of ex- e
elusion that could be derived from so dangerous
and desperate an expedient, that p
ivould not apply will) equal force and jus- C
lice, to the whole class of citizens with
ivhom I deemed it my duty on that occaiion
to co-operate. 1

rom each other. This is, as it should be. tj
ro allow past political differences, fb turn w
is aside from the duty of the present, is to p
acrifice our country to our enemies?and gj

itoop over the slumbering embers of old 81
>arty lends, and by raking in their ashes,
Lindle up a flame, by which their political 8|
pponents may be blackened or defor- g(
ned?dun the state be divided, weakened, 0.
nd districted. If to forgive, when wrong- fc
id, is the dictate of our nobler convictions, j.
iow much more obvious the duty of forgetting
past differences of opinion merely,
vhen new questions and dangerous as- ol
aults upon our rights, appeal to our pa- C(
riotism for harmony and co-operation. 0j
(indness, generosity, and magnanimity,
lave ever characterised our noble state in 0j
ler conduct towards her public servants;
nd she cannot riow be dragged down from Vj
ler old arid hoiitfred custom in this high
espect. Honesty of purpose?fidelity to

In the controversy of'32 and '33 I dare pj
lot suppose that 1 was without fault. In
imes of high party excitement the wisest pu
nd the coolest heads are liable to uncon- i?

Clous perversion, uuii uanu lur iiijsen ^
nd those with whom I acted, what I cc
recly accord to others?a conscientious t0

id, or said, was done and spoken, open- p2
v and freely. It is not consistent with at
ie grounds upon which my friends ta
rought my name forward for the high j,a
flice of Governor, that 1 should dwell jn
pon those events. It was to harmonise ^

that, .tfeey,deemed,?fc? -worthy W-stofipflri:

To the past then I will not advert?I h?v6
nothing on my own part to extenuate, I
have nothing to allege against ' others.
But of the future it may not be-improper
to speak: and indeed, if the welfare and
interests of the State only, are to be consulted,
it is to the future, that the thoughts
and energies of her citizens should be directed.
Although the tone of those who have
thought proper to assail me in the publfd
prints, excludes the idea, of other motives <

them, there may be some who desire
to know my course with respect to future
meastires, from an honest conviction of
their importance, and a patriotic zeal for
the interest and honour of the State; But
one measure of the kind has been alluded
to in the papers; and on that I pm ready
freely to answer. \ The Tarff question
may again be opened, and the? Would
wish lo know what course I should pursue,
should a .protective vTarHT be again
pressed upon the country.
I do not anticipate any difficulty in the
adjustment of the Tariff during the ensiling
session of Congress. 1 am satisfied tha$
the A-lrmnisifation at least have no desire -
nor design of perpetuating the policy of
im posing ilnties for the protection of manufacturers?instead
of layinj them simply
for. revenue. But it mny be otherwise?
Contrary to onr expectation, Gen. Harrison
may be elected President of the United
Slates, and tvith the elevation of his party
io power, may ue revived the old strife of
Bank, Tariff, Internal Improvements, &c.
kc. in their usual round of succession.
If the Tariff policy is again attempted to
tie renewed or perpetuated, my position
is a citizen or as an officer shall be plain
ind decided. The question as to the pbli:y
of this system, differs in many respects 1
rom what it was seven years since. If

s tlirn made by any party whatever, which
irevniis at the Federal Head, to perpetuate
t, South Carolina ought not in my opinion
o submit to it. Nor when the remedy is
o be applied, do I think we should qnarel
among ourselves, "as. to mode and

implcst, the most efficacious and direct,
ihould be at once resorted to?and in such
in emergency I doubt not that the State
