tierce additional strength from the great
embarrassments experienced during the
present year, in those branches of the
serice, and nuder which they are now
suffering. Several of the most important
surveys and constructions directed by recent
laws. have been suspended in consequence
of the want of adequate force in
these corps. The like observations may
be applied to the Ordinaucc corps, aud
the General Staff, the operations of which,
as they are now organized, must either
be -frequently interrupted, or performed
by officers taken from the line of the array,
to the great prejudice of the serrice.
For a general view of the condition of
the Military Academy, and of other
branches of the military serrice not already
noticed, as well as for fuller iilus-j
trations of those which have been mentioned,
1 refer you to the accompanying
documents; and among the various proposals
contained therein for legislative
action, I would particularly notice the
suggestion of the Secretary of War for
the revision of the pay of the army, as
- ? 1
entitled to your uvoraoie regaru. I
The national policy, founded a like in
l&lcrcst and in humanity, so long and su
steadily pursued by this Government, for
the removal of the Indian tribes originally
settled oil litis side of the Mississippi, to
the vest of that river, may be said to have
v been consummated by the conclusion of
the late treaty with the Chcrokccs* The
measures taken in the execution of that
treaty, and in relation to our Indian
affairs generally, will fully appear by referring
to the accompanying papers.? j
Without dwelling on the numerous and,
important topics embraced in them, 1 j
again invite your attcution to the importance
of providing a well-digested and j
comprehensive system lor mc protection,
supervision, and improvement of the virions
tribes now planted in the Indian
country. The suggestions submitted by
the Commissioner of Indian A flairs, and
enforcd by the Secretary, on this subject,
and also in regard to the establishment of
additional military posts in the Indian
country, ore entitled to your profound
consideration. Both measures arc necessary
for the double purpose of protecting
the Indians from intestine .war, and in
other respects complying with our engagements
to them, and of securing our
western frontier against incursions, which
otherwise trill assuredly be made on iu
The best hones of humanity, in regard to I
? * '
the aboriginal race, lite welfare of our
rapidly extending settlements, and the
honor of the United States arc all deeply
iurolred in the relations existing between
this Gorcrn ncnl and the emigrating tribes.
I trust therefore, that the various matters
submitted in the accompanying documents,
in respect to those relations, will
rcccirc your early and mature deliberation;
And thai it may issue in the adoption
of legislative measures adapted to the circumstances,
and duties of the present
crisis.
. You are referred to the report of the
cretarj of the Navy for a sai.sfector-. view o(
the operations of tho department under his
charge, during the preseut year. In the
construction of ve??ds at tl?c different nary
yards and m the employment of our ships
and * juadrcus at sea, that branch of the service
)?.is been actively and usefully employed.
While the situation of our commercial in
t crests iu ihc West ladies required ? greater
number than u>ual of armed vessels to be
kept on thai station, it u gratifying to perceive
that the protection doe to our com- j i
merer in other quarters of the world has not >
proved insufficient. Every effort has been '
made to facilitate the equipment of the ex-! <
pJoring expedition authorneed by the act of t1
the last ncsbion, but all the preparation nc- <
ccssarj to enable it to sail has not yet been I
completed. No means wtU be spared by tbo <
Government to fit out the expedition on a ?
scale corresponding with the liberal appro- ?
priation for tbc purpose, and with tbe elc- j t
rated character oi tho objects which arc to <
b? effected by it. | <
1 beg leave to renew the recommendation
made in tny lw iiiiuj :uoasa^r, respecting '
the eiilirtmeui of bojrs in our naval service, i <
and <o urge upon your "attention the neces-! |
it? of fonher appropriations to increase the <
number of ships afloat, and to enlarge gen-' |
eralljr tbe capacity and force of the nary.? I
The increase of our Gotmncn c, and our position
in regard to tbe other powers of tbe
urorld, will always make it our policy and in
tcrest to cherish tbe great naval resources of
car country. j
The report of iho Postmaster General |
present* a gratifying picture of ibe condition
of tbe Post Office Department. Its reren-:
uea for tlie year ending the 30th of June last,
were $3,398,455 19, showing an increase
of revenue over iliat of the preceding year
of $404,878 53, or more than 13 per cent. '
The expenditures for the same year trero
$3,755,G23 7G, exhibiting a surplus of I
$643,831 43. The Department has beet: |
redeemed from embarrassment and debt, i
has accumulated a surplus exceeding half a <
million of dollars, has largely extended, and I
is preparing still farther to extend tho mail
service, am! recommends a reduction of;
postages equal 10 about 20 per cent. It is '
practising upon the great principle, which i
should control every branch of our Govern- '
meat, of rendering to the public tlie greatest I
good possible, with the least possible taxa-ji
lion to the people.
The scale of postages suggested bv the ;
Postmaster General recommend* itself not <
only by the reduction it proposes, but by the
simplicity of its arrangement, its conformity
with the Federal currency, and the improvement
it will introduce into the acconntsj
of the Department and its agents.
^Qur partial!j- npcv',,v' t'tvitco to t!]?
subject of mail contracts with railroad com-1
panies. The present lavs, providing lor the
making of contracts, are based upon thei
presumption that competition among bidders
will secure the service at a fair price. But
on most of the railroad lines, there is noj
competition in that kiod of transportction,
and advertising is therefore useless. No!
contract can now be made with them except;
such as shall be negotiated before the time
of offering, or afterwards, and the power of;
the Postmaster General to pay them high
prices, 13 practically without limitation. It?
would be a relief to him, and no doubt would 1
- - - - ! _ ,
conduce 10 the public interests, to prcscnue, j
by law, some equitable basis upon which j
such contracts shall rest, and restrict him by!
a fixed rule of allowance, Under a liberal i
act of that sort be would undoubtedly be
able to securo the services of most of the
railroad companies, and the interest of the
Department would be tbus advanced.
The correspondence between the people
of the United States and the European nations,
and particularly with the British islands,
has become rcry extensive, and requires
the interposition of Cougrcss to give
it security. No obstacle is perceived to an
interchange of mails between New York!
and Liverpool^ or other foreign ports, as
proposed by the Postmaster General; on the
contrary, it promises, by tho security it wu!1
afford, to facilitate commercial transactions, I
r>.t mm riui in an ?nlar?rod interraurvc
""" fe'*- ? ? *?. ;
among the people of different nations, which
cannot but hare a happy effect. Through
the city of New York most of the correspondence
between the Canadas and Euiopc
is now carried on, and urgent representations
hare been received from the bead of
(he Provincial post office, asking the interposition
of (he United States to guard it
from the accidents and losses to which it is
now subjected. Seme legislation Appears to
be called for, as well by our own interest,
as by comity to the adjoining British Provinces.
The expediency of providing a fire-proof
building for the important books and papers
of the Post Office Department, is worthy of
consideration. In the present condition of
our Treasury, it is neither ncoessary no*
wise to Icaro essential public interests exposed
to so much danger, when they can so
readily be made secure There are weighty
enn?idf.-ratious in the location of a new build
ing for the Department, in favor of placing
it near the other Executive building*.
The important subjects of a survey of the
coast, and the manufacture of a standard of'
weights and mcasorcs for the different co?-(
torn-houses, have been in progress for aomu
years, under the goucraJ direction of the
Executive, and the immediate superintcndcncc
of a gentleman possessing high scientific
attainments. At the last session of
Congress, the making of a set of weights
and measures for cich State in the Union
was added to the others by a joint rcsolatioo.
The care and correspondence as to all
these st;hjeeu have been devolved on the!
Treasury department during the last year.
A special report from the Secretary of
the Treasury will soon he communicated
to Congress, which will show what ha*
been accomplished as to the whole, the
number and compensation of the, person*
now employed in these duties, arid the
progress expected to be made during the
ensuing year, with a copy of the various
correspondence deemed necessary to'
throw light on the subjects which seem j
to require additional legislation. ?.iaiui?
have been made for retrospective allow*
nee* in behalf of the superintendent,
and some of his assistants, w hich 1 did
nut feel justified in granting; other claims
have been made for largo increases in
compensation, which, under all the circumstances
of the several eases, I declined
making without the express saneLion
of Congress. In order to obtain
hit sanction, the subject was at the last j
tension, ou my suggestion, and by request
if the immediate superintendent, submitled
by the Treasury Department to the
luiutmitlec of Commerce of the House
jf Representatives. But no Icgislaicrc
teti'Mj having taken plsce, the early atiiinti'ii
of emigres* in now united to the
Biiaciument of some eipress ami detailed
provisions in relation to the various
rlaiins made for the past, and to the com
[>CRMUOn BIXJ allowances ccwcu prujicr
Cor the future.
It is further respertfully recommended
[hat such being the inconvenience of at'
tention to these duties by the Chief Magistrate,
and such the great pressure of business
on the Treasury Department, the
general supervision of tho coast surrey, 1
Mid the completion of the weights and 1
measures, if the works ore kept united,
ihould be derolred on a board *>f officers,
organized speciMlly for tbat purpose, or
nil the Navy Hoard attached to the N'avy 1
Department. i1
All my experience and reflection con-,
firm the conviction I hsrc so often expressed
to Congress, in favor of an
ime nil men I of the constitution, which
- -I' av?nl tit ft ftll>rlinn of,
WIII jirr^rui, m .
the President and Vice President of the
United Stairs devolving on tho House of
Representatives and the Semite: and I,
therefore beg leave again to solicit your
iltenlion to the subject. There were
rarious other suggestions in my last on*;
nual message, not acted upon, particular-1
ly that relating to the want of uniformity '
in the laws of the District of Columbia, j
that arc deemed worthy of your favorable
consideration.
Before concluding this paper, I think!
it ilue to the various Executive Depart-1
mcnls to hear testimony to their prosper-,
ous condition, anil to the ability and integrilv
with wnirh they have been con-'
diftrd. ft ha; been mv aim to enforce j
iu ail of ihem a vii gilanl aud imllli/u) dls-1
cilarge of the public business, and it is
gratifying to me to beliere that there is
no just cause of complaint from any
quarter, at the manner in which they hare I
fulfilled the objects of their creation.
Having now finished the observations 1
deemed proper on this, the last occasion
I shall have of communicating with the
two (louses of Congress at their meeting,
I cannot omit an expression of the gratitude
which is due to the great body of my
fellow-citizens, in whose partiality and indulgence!
have found encouragement and
support in the many difficult and trying
ihmnrrl? irhich it has been my lot to
WVVM%t' *" w"e" * ?
paw during ray public career. Though j
deeply sensible lhat my exertions hare
not been crowned with a success corresponding
to the degree of faror bestowed
upon me; I am sure that they will be con-1
sidered as haring been directed by an earnest
desire to promote the go-xl of my
country; and I am consoled by the per-;
suasion that whatever errors haro been
committed will find a corrective in the
intelligence and patriotism of those who
succeed us. All lhat hoa occurred during
my administration is calculated to inspire
me with increased confidence in the sta-;
bility of our institutions; and should I be!
I spared to enter upou that retirement which
so suitable to my age and infirm health,
and so .much desired by me in other re
