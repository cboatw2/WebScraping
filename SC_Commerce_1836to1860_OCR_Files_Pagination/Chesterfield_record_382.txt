The misfortune attending ngricultmai t
Journals, is, that instead of showing how :o , 1
reclaim worn lands, and to prevent the good
from deteriorring?in short how to do j j
every thing in the best and most thorough c
manner?t teaches us how to wear out all j ;
our lands un J reclaim none, by an extravagant
and slovenly system. Accounts of v
heavy planting to the hand, and large, per \ t
hand produ-tioa, which are only published ! j
when seasons and other ci renins'a rices eon- :

land in'o cul ivation, as ho is ''doing no- 1 i

out a plantation/which, by rotation, manu- j j
ring, and resting, might hove been always i.
kept up, and by increase! per acre pro luc- !

slovenly tillage which ruined it. And the re : (

quantity required by this miseta le s; f- 1 (

SILK CULTURE AND VERY SUPERIOR SILK j
. WORM EGGS. ' j
? * - * - ?*? r-?
We have a tetter worn mrs. cjiuunur i
Spann ofSumt"r District giving nn account ! i
of an experiment mare by her, the presem ! <
season, in silk culture, which, although nj
private litter, end from u lady too, we felt j
strongly tempted to present to our readers, ;
knowing that all of them who take an inter- j'
est in this new agricultural enterprise (now ; '
in South Carolina) would read it, as we did ' 1
ourselves, with high gratification. Mrs. j
Spann commenced last year with 500 f
worms, has made this season 50*hushels of j ^
cocoons, and expects, fho next year to feed j
a million of worms.. She, last year, raised .
"* ? m ftko nrrrre aT fho i
u icw wunns iiiiiciitu iiuiu uiv ijjp-i v. j 4
same season, and expects now to make a
second crop in the same way. Her co- I
coons are very superior. When gathered j 1
it took Uyteigh a pound only 112, selected ; 15
160 to 'JBr not selected ; and of tkc very j
smallest, 300. After the nio;h has escaped I ?
the average weight of pure silk is from 7 o ; <
8 grains. Herself and her neighbor, Mrs. j <
Sumter, now have a large quantity of eggs,! 1
from th? arms, to dispose of. Here ]
then is an opporlun ty to procure eggs of 1
the best quality by persons wishing to com- j
mence the silk culture. Of eggs procured [
immediately, enough would probably hatch, j j
the present season, for a 6rst experiment,} r
' ?L'UIJ>1I HAJMM HUUTi'rhilst
the greater number would not hatch 1
ill next spring. Mrs. Spunn n.igM he J
idJiessed on the subjvel at Sumteivilli?.? f)
)r if orders were left with us, we woulJ v
ikp pleasiire in forwarding them. Only c
he I irg? st and best cocoons v e ? s< Icon d o
or eggs. Tne eggs noni which tli st* s
forms s[ ring were cure fully selected in ^
France and Ituly for Mrs. Sum er. c
I'll*? part of the business in which mos (
>orsof)s, who have not triod it, apprehend '
it/ficul y, is reeling. Oil this l ea l Mrs '
Spann sa\s, "I commenced reeling las
veek on tlic Pe dnionirse reel, ai.d find not
noro difficulty, nor indeed near as much as 1
had anticipated." ' 1
In other part of thq letter sho says : "So <
strong is iny desire to see the silk business j
irosper, and so great is my confidence in j
ts ultimate scoots-;, ii a: I would, the ensu. }

jurtly meialic. Paper money had l>-on is.

rovernment, witnessing the 'saint iry cflTrts '

institution expired in 1811 ; in 1816, at the *
ecommend.ation of Mr. Madison, a second 1
dank was created, v\hieh expired in 1836. {
