ignorant ot medical science that it is impossible

These pills, mild ana agreeable in their nature,

been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the Soutn and South West. Although
it originated in an obscure part of the cdtln- I
try but a few years since, it is how found ih all the (
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its t
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a ?
general Tonic, are appreciated by all who have j
used it Being as it professes h compound of |
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to offer the as- t
surance that there is no Arsenic,Mercury, nor any
tiling in the least hurtful to the human constitu- ?
tion in it. It will be found a valuable Medicine
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach

PATEKT COTTONT CJIIV.
qpHis Gin can be made double, or single. If
* u,?w uuuuie, iney reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gih, no other knd Havihg been in use pievous
to this pitte'nt j and whether aihgle or double they
are found to improVe the quality of the cotton by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 20 to 1G0 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, Which free the cotton
Irom leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half
gNied state, before it'descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set ol
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to ieed slow or fafet to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of tw'e saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders,
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It majr also be propelled by iron running nnnr
The force required to work it, is about the same as
that necessary to move ah equal number of saws in
the common Gih. This Gin has been put in
operation id New Orleans for two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and ethers, and
received their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind As to give
the Patentee their Vvrittert opinion respecting the
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient:

be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the process.

from the common Gine in use, and that it saves
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &c.

Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in "reply to your note.
Accompanied by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, 1 beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a'decldrd improvement on the usual process
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
and freo from tttip Or trash, clean and of good color;
thereby giving the article an additional value.
These 'faVoraule impressions of the advantages of
your Paieht'Glh, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
readily pefdelvCd and properly appreciated by the
intelligent planter.
Feeling a deep interest in the success of nil improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
of our country, I trust that yours will meet with
the encouragement it justly merits.
Very respectfully, your ob't sorv't,
if. F. M'KENNA.

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in answei tc your inquiry
of iny opinion pf your l'utent Cotton Gin, I
leave to slate, that 1 was fifteen years engaain
the cotton factories of Manchester. Eng,
and during four rears of lliut time. 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
& Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sandford Gricne. I have seen your
i Cotton Gin in operation, und have examined th?
I cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it belter cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It* is completely
ready for the breaker without the aid of the
bloxyer, arid would, therefore, save the first process
in manufacturing the article. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would command frcrn cue
to two cents cm the pound more than the av< rngo
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by common Gins. Yours, very icsp'K-.
N. Orleans, March I), GEORGE EENIOR.

1 have to stale, that I have been engaged in put]
ting up the Carver Gins for planters en lit d River,
and (hat I have Seen your Gin in operation, aiid
have examined the quality of the cotton produced

Gins: in addition to which, 1 think your feeders
a decided improvement,, and by the aid of

jnucli improved, over that produced by the common
Gins. Yours &e. E. BENNETT.

and becoming responsible for !he amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders for Gin?,
they should accompany thcin with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Ac. It is found they differ in oninion. Som?
aesire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common size is 9 or 10 inches; but some wish
them 12 inches. Some wish 5 or C rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not wont more than 4
at most. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
Inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer tboy should, at the time of
giving orders, lurnish a statement of their wishes,
and the bianufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, we
shall make them on the most modern and approved
Iilan. An order can be executed, from the time it
s received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
and the Gin in that time placed in the hands of the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands- of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they arc late in commencing to pick or gin
cotton.
