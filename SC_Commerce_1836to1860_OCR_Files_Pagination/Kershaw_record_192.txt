k and which haa neceaaarily thrown ita

Thia Convention, therefore, cannot too
earnestly rgcommend the speedy Adoption
by all their fellow citizens of measures
introduce commercial education amonir
our yootb; to train them up to the habits
of business* and thereby to establish a
body of merchants whose every interest
. and feeling shall be contered in the country
which has reared and sustained them.
6. Resolved, That this convention is of
opinion that the establishment by manufacturers
in foreign countries of agencies
in the chief southern ports, for the sale
of the various articles exported by them
to the United States, would conduce to the
restoration of the direct foreign trade of
the south; and that similar establishments
for the sale of domestic articles would be

be'appointcd to prepare an address to the
pegpbe of the Southern and South-V/osterix
Slates, urging upon them the expediency
of giving their hearty co-operation
in the accomplishment of the great object
of this convention.
7. Resolved, That when this Convention
adjourns, it shall adjourn t<* meet at
Augusta 011 the third Monday in October
next, and that a committee of correspondence-be

interested in the objects of this Convention,
and to secure a full representation
lroin every part of* those states.
8, Resolved, That it is recommended to
the members of this Convention, to assemble
the citizens of their counties' or districts,
and place before them their proceedings,
and to urge upon them the expediency
of promoting the mcasnrcs recommended
bv this convention, and particularly
of forming Limited Partnerships, under
the laws passed by the southern states
us aforesaid.
"Whereas, the completion of the lines
connecting the Southern Atlantic cities
with the great valley of the Mississippi
is the most prominent and efficient measure
to promote the useful and patriotic
object which lias culled this Convention
together, therefore
t). Resolved, That this convention is
deeply and solemnly impressed with the
transccndant importance of the works of
Internal Itunrovcmciil which is iulnndod
to effect this intercommunication, and
most earnestly invoke the people of the
South and South-western States to bring
all their energies and resources to bear
npon this vital point, not doubling that
such ellortsrts will crown with brilliant
success the noble enterprise.
10. Resolved, That the members of this
convention in recommending the aforesaid
resolutions, to their constituents, of
the southern and south-western states, will
afford to them the most undoubted pledge
of their sincerity, l>y adopting them as a
rule for their own conduct, hereby declaring
in the most solemn manner, in the
temple of the Most High, that in all commercial
dealing they will give preference
to the Direct Importers, and zealously endeavor
in all cases, to carry out the views
and recommendations of this Convention.
Previous to any question being.taken on
the resolutions, Col. Memminger rose
and addrerscd the convention at length,
in a very able speech, in which he touched
011 the effects of the Tariff, the United
States Hank, the Dcposite Hanks, and Mr
Wright's warehouse system, on the commerce
of the South. We have been promised
a copy of the speech, and hope to
be able shortly to give it to our readers.
The Resolutions were then unanimously
npopted, returning thanks to the Chairman
of the Committee, and the President
and Secretary of the Convention, for the
able manner in which they had discharged
their various duties; to the Trustees of the
Church for the use of their building, and
to the citizens of Augusta for their hospitality.
After which "it was moved and
carried, oil motion of Ker Boycc, Esq. of
Charleston, that the Charleston delegation
have the proceedings of this convention
printed end distributed under their supervision
and at their expense. It was also
'.ycsolvod that the President appoint the
committees under the above resolutions at
his leisure. The Convention then adjourned

From the Savannah Georgian.
FROM FLORIDA.
Capture of more than 500 Indians confirmed.
By the arrival yesterday afternoon of
the steamer James Adams, Captain Chase,
from Black Creek, and through the attention
of Captain C., we have received from
a correspondent the following intelligence
confirming rumors heretofore prevailing.
41 To the Editor of the Georgian:
Black Cheek, (E. F.) April 4, 1338.
41 I forward vou a conv of Brie. Gen.
Nelson's official report. You may rely
upon the following as facts. Gen. Jesup
had arranged with the chiefs of the camp,
near Jupiter,'to meet* him in couneil on
the 20th ult. but they failed to attend, and
front the driving in of ponies and other
indications, he believed they were preParing
to fly to the swamps.
"The General determined that they
should not escape, and ordered Col. D. E
1 wtggs of tho 2d dragoons to secure
them. 1 lie Colonel arranged matters so
< * i I | ? ,
Lriwifrjlhr 1*?tMscesded in taking
every iudlvidoel on the 2lst.
"There were upwards of 600 men, wo*
men, and children; and amoufc them.over
one hundred and fiAy warriors.* In addition
to these there were Jeken^toO negroes*
about forty of whom are capable of bearing
arms. So you perceive that General |
I J*s. operations in the vieinily of Jupiter)
I Inlet have resulted io securing upwards of
000 prisoners, and silencing near 200 rifles.
"General Jesup was up to the 27th of
March busily employed in disposing of
his Drisoners. as he was. anxious to nush
south, in order to join Col. Bunkheadt|
who was in full pursuit pf Sam Jones,'
and with.aome prospect of overtaking him. i
The General has admirably managed the j
whole business. The force of the enemy
is broken and dispirited, and all hands
agree that lie has done all that man could I
do, under the same circumstances."
LATEST FROM. MEXICO.
From the Courier we take the following
summary of uews receive! yesterday from
Mexico:
lly the Comet, the Merchants* Exchange
received copious files of papers from the
city of Mexico, for the loan of which we
arc indebted to the keeper of that institution.
Tbev contain nothing of interest to
.1. a ? t-1 a
me American rcaucr, ueing occupied exclusively
with the local concerns of the
country, such as proclamations, discussions
on their system of government, and
the French Indemnity, which they bfciieve
to be oppressive and unjust, and are therefore
unwilling to liquidate.
Mexico, by her dissentions aud bad government,
is at the mercy of all ntfKons.
France has claims against her, the payment
oi which she will insist on at the
point of the bayonet; so has the United
States. Texas has a covetous eye on
some of her territories, and on the first
favorable opportunity will possess herself
of th cm. Her frontiers are threatened by
innumerable hordes of Savages, who
aware of the succour they will receive
from the Texinns, will rob and lay waste
her outer settlements; Such, in a few
words, is the situation of Mexico. She
is encompassed by a thousand dangers,
und yet her people arc divided amongst
themselves, and coing as much or more
toward the destruction of their country as
its enemies..
An acrostic on the name of General
Urrca appears in the National, in which
I federation and the Alamo, where so many
of the brave Texiuns perished, are conspicuously
inserted in capitals.
The murder of these unfortunate men
in cold blood, would have been a capital
crime in any civilized country, but in
Mexico it is regarded as a glorious fete.
FROM TEXAS.
The captain of the schooner Edgar, now
in port, informs us that lie saw nothing
of the blockaded squadron, although he
left Galveston three days after the departure
of the steamer Columbia. The
Houston Telegraph of the 17th March
mentions the return of the commissioners
sent to treat with the Cumanches. They
report that (he Cumanches refused to treat
with them, unless the full and undisturb
cd possession of the country north of tl.e
Gaudaloupc mountains was guaranteed to
them. Having no authority to make such
a v.uui}*:aaiuii, mc l uiiiiinssiuiiurs imjuusted
them to send a deputation of chiefs to
llexar, this April, to confer with the Tcxian
Government, to which they acceded,
The Mexicans have done their best to instigate
this savage tribe to war with their
American neighbors, but hitherto without
success. It is evident, however, that a
jeolousy is excited by the growing power
of Texas, and that the encroachments ol
the white settlers are viewed with alarm,
and is persevered in, will be repelled by
the whole of that powerful nation. It
will be the policy of Texas to soothe ami
conciliate a foe so conformidable. 'They
cherish a hcrditary animosity to Mexico,
and in a war with that country, would
prove faithful and serviceable auxiliaries.
