jfiJed it will now. Two of the vetoes were
i>y the first President; his name precludes '
discussion of them. The next two Presi-1
dents, Adams and Jefferson, did not ro-1
sort to the power. Mr. Madison exercis- j
ed it four times?the calmest, tho most J
philosophical of all our Presidents, who ,
had most deeply studied and most eiegan- I
tly expounded onr Constitution?whose j
pure life, clear intellect, and gentle virtues !
embalm him in the mellowest affections!
of his countrymen. Mi Monroe exercis. |

IlTo iiinm, i mua |
ridfi by Mr. Madison occured in his first
term, two in 1811, and one in 1812; and
he was re-elected. Mr. Monroe's veto
was in his first term, and he was reelected.
Four of General Jackson's occurred in his
first term, and he was re-elected, and.
moreover, was sufficiently popular at the j
end of his seccnd term to secure the elec- <
tion of his nominee. Every President j
who has exercised the veto power has :
been re-elected: and the three who failed !
I
in a re-election never did exercise the |
power. These facts prove, beyond all
controversy, that the country has not
been injured or offended hv the exercise
of this power heretofore, and that the objections
t?? it, therefore, are not practical i
or warranted by experience; hut, on the j
contrary, that history nod experience in- j
contcs'ably prove the unsoundness of;
those theories and speculations, which j
would persuade us either that the power ;
is inconsistent with the interest of the !
country, or a dangerous or even offensive
restraint upon the w ill of majority.
This is, perhaps, neither the time nor i
place to discuss the theory of a qualified
veto. Finding it in the Constitution, the !
abstract question is remi'tcd from the (
Senate to the schools. There was a '
time when it was open for discussion, j
^ and when, if it involved such serious and .
exciting topics as those now pressed into ;
the discussion, the\ would have heon dc" !
veloped hy the searching dialectics of;
Madison, or riven out by the lightning i
flashesof Patrick Henry. H it the deba- J
tes of the general convention, nor those of
the State conventions, furnish us with;
objections to this f?ower. It passed into
the Cons'itution by a general aeqiies
cenco, as an obviously necessary portion j
of the system. Each of the other depart-j
ments is armed with checks to protect the
jpmeral interests, or its own particular
privileges and functions; and it would
have been strange, indeed, if tho Exoen- j
tive department had been endowed with I
no means of self-pratection- The can
tinn of the convention liinted it to this!
negative power. His sole participation :
in the making of laWs i?, tosav, that, in
the particular instance, they shall not be j
changed hy a mere majority. While the !
President is r idowed with the veto for th?
purpose, amongst other things, ofprotec- ;
ling the Executive department against j
the encroachments of the Legislative, the j

him to the foce?ity of returning the ve !

in writing; and, if two thirds are found in !
the measure. it becomes a law. Besides!
the apparent propriety ofsuoh a power to j
protect department against another, '
reason for it derived from another source i
is hardly less cogent: the President, at j
the head of the Executive department, is j
bound to ?eo the laws executed ; he is :
also sworn fo support and maintain the i
Constitution. :Vow, in case he he called !

his duties would he of the most einhar* j

There are other cogent reasons foultd for it
ip genera! policy. It is a check upon histy j
logic) at ion ; it is a ch-ck upon mistaken legis- :
lation; i' is a check upon in'emp?'rate legisla
tion?th* r-cult either of Mudden passion, o-, i
jvhal i" likely to occur more hvquent'y, the;
violence of party spirit. All free Govern- ;
went* are controlled by party, and all parties
tend to extreme*, and to the oppression of'
the minority. This tendency is strengthened j
?nd aeceJeratad in assemblies which grow
heated and exacerbated by the collisions of
debate and the excitement of public discussion, j
from which the remotenpss of the President .
and the intcnsmess of his single responsibili- i
ty exempt him. Crowds of men often do i
acts which no one individual, even of that
crowd, would venture upon. If the President j
(as is apt to be most frequently the ca-r) be j
of the dominant party, then his veto power is
t least innocuous; but if he Inppen to be o :
the m norify party, or to rise superior to party j
frsling, then, indeed, his veto become* con *r. ,
t'iitte. Then the harmless, t!ie merely hinder, j
trig, power with which he is endowed, becomes
an instrument of merry and of good.
Let it he borne in mind throughout, that the j
veto is but the power of liiuderance. Ah such
it was recognised and permitted to exist in the
Tribunes by Sylla not a sword to wound. It
does not arm the Executive with a thunderbolt,
though it inay endow him wi'h the tnorp !
godlike, because the more beneficent, attr;- j
bute of staying the headlong impetuosity of
party rage.
It may be asked, is the rase to be suppos- j
ed that the two Houses of Congress will pass
measures injuiious to the country? I answer, j
yea. It may happen, and has happened. Ail I
legislative bodies fall into error?all dominant j
parties do wrong. Ten out of tho fourteen
vetoes were eminently proper?probably !
twelve?possibly all. I do ht whether an
much can be said for any fourteen consecutive
laws on your stafu'e book.
As a mere question of authority arid of the ;
opinions of men, the weight is by no means so |
much in favor of tiie bill in any porticular case
as it seems to be supposed. It is said that |
it ie the President against Congress, where- |

being b*t?*en the Congress of iaat vcar tmd
vf ' v*;i ii ii?*"i< j | inn c muuiu nv wnw ? ,
a pervading npTit of compromise, xnd also a j
sufficient power to protect section.il rights J
and interests. It wis obvious, from the be- !
ginning, that a certain degree of conflict would I
a'ways exist betweon those opposing intcres's, !
and thai combinations might be formed by, '
majorities to oppress minorities. In this body i
States are represented. In the other House, I
minute subdivisions of States. The gratitude I
the associations, the sympathies the quick !
in-tinctive impulse, of every member are fori
his immediate local constituents. On qnes.
rions n( great magnitude, we rise to the contemplation
of the whole; but it is with an j
effort. The President is elected by all the
Sta*o9, al! the sections, a'lthe people. He is
not railed upon to rise from a part to the
whole; for to Jio whole he belongs. He is not j
call?d upon to attend to local or sectional in- j
iprosffl, opinions, or prejudices; hut it is his !
interests, as well as his dutv, to see that all !
all are harinoniz d under the Constitution; j
and in case of tyrannical combinations, he j
stands in a constitutional position to protect ;
the weaker, and readjust the equilibrium, j
Phis view of the matter cannot but present j
itself to the contemplation of the Southern
srmrion?the weakest, the most peculiar, I
lite most segegraietl?that against which,
at this moment, is directed, by all
the irts of a cunning policy, and all the
furv of an inflamed fanaticism, a burning tide
ol public opinion, already bubbling and hissing ,
in these halls. I do not intend to stir up these
angry elements, now and far less to intimate !
that the Southern section, if the worst come |
To the worst, is not able to tnke care of itself. !
What I infer is. that the checking power of
the President might be a resource against
that worst?might give the assailed section
tfjostrength, not only of law, hut of the forms
of law, and protect us by the Constitution, in- ;
stead of our being remitted to our natural I
rights and our own force. The whole p. n:- i
tmn of the pres:dentia! office Would authorize j
;*n I call upon hiin to perform such a duty; and, |
boa des the constitutional obligation* upon hint j
to interpose, I cannot but hope and believe j
that, standing upon that empyreal elevation,
at once the height, and end of human amhition.he
would fee! his moral nature purified
and invigorated by 'hat superior atmosphere
to the great tank of performing tlua sacred
good. It will be perceived at once, how large
h portion of these moral influences depends
upon the abstraction of all motives but those
of duTyjrom the bosoin of the Presidrm*, that
he should no!-he in a condition to expect any
thingtfoin future majorities, or be d*t ?rred from J
hi* duty by dread of failing?the desire of sue- |
reeding in a re-election. To consti'iite him the
fit, the safe, and the efficient trusteo of this !
great duty, he should be incapable of all motives 1
but to perform it.
Tit; S' mtnr from Kentucky lws adverted to:
t!m Constitutions or the varous Siatas, either j
for confirmation or illustration of hi" views of i
the Executive veto. [ do not think that an ex.
animation of thein will aid his urgumen'. They i
establish no geneial principie, unless it be. that, j
where the separation of the Executive depart,
ment from tho Legislative has Ixieu attempted
to bo maintained, the veto is allowed. A m i.
jority of the States have adopted a qualified veto,
viz: Maine. New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Now York, Ponnsylvania (?eorgia
Kentucky, Mississippi Alabama, Louisiana,
Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan?fifteen
; being a m ijority of the States a majority
of the new Slates, and courting a vaxl majority
of the popula ion. In all theso Siat?-s,
with the single exception of Kentucky, the
Executive is elected by the people.
In most of the othe-e, he is elected by the Legislature,
showing that the separation betweon
the co-ordinato branches of Government is but
little insisteJon?or, rather that, tho Governor
s a ino-o ministerial officer of the Legislature, ,
without those high powors embraced in iho idea |
of an Exeeulivo. In general, where the Ex- I
ecutive in recognised as a co-ordinate depart- [
ment, it is endowed with the power of snlt pro.
lection bv veto, I am awaro that the Senator's
proposition does not propose, in terms, to abrog.it
i tho veto, but only to impose stronger restrictions
upon it. by allowing it to be overruled
by a bare majority, instead of requiring two.
thirds. Practically, tho requiring of ? ba-e
majority removes the check entirely, or divests
it ofall most essential benefit*. Its vory ohjer.t
is to chcvk the majority. In popular institutions
part}' governs. And the dominant party commtnd'
majorities. Whatever, therefore tho intemperance
ofparty enacts, it cm maintain;
and, by tno proposition, the appeal taken by the
Executive is to be triod on the spot by those
from whom the appeal was taken. In an appeal
froirvPhiN'P diunk to Phillip sober, there was
the Congress of this?between the wisdom of
the past and of the present.
Upon a comparison of the Executive department,
as organized by the Constitution,
with this branch of the Legislative department.
we will be struck with the superior
magnitude of the powers of the Senate, and
the inferior responsibility oftho Senators; so
that, if mere theoretical objections are to
havo weight at this time of day. instead of
ca-rying reform into other departments, one.
might tremble to see it brought within this
hail. The President, in the first place, is
elected by the people; we by Legislatures, intermediate
between us and the people. His
tenure of office is for four years, ours for six.
At the end of every four years there is, of
may be, a new Executive; this body it permanent,
receiving an accession of but one-third
every two years. The President has no leglialative
function whatever; this body has all
tho legislative functions. In the judicial de- >
pariment the President has no power; this is
the high judicature of impeachment, to which
ho and the judges, and all, are liable. Mis
Executive powers are shared by us in the important
par'icu'ars of appointments of public
officer* and the making of treaties. In short,
with the most limited Executive in the world,
we have a Senate of the most multifarious and
exalted functions?far beyond those with
Which the French Chamber of Peers or the j
English House of Lords are endowed. In its
organization this is a very exalted, augu?t?
and powerful body. We are representatives
of sovereign States?lawgivers?judges?and
possessing Executive power. We are but
fiffv six, not one-fourth of either of the foreign
Senates to which I have alluded. Here is an
immense aggregation of power; may it be always
characterized by a cojrespondmg digni.
ty and wisdom It is decent, or prudent, or
safe, for u? to ask for more power or, complain 1
that s>?me small check upon us has been con. I
tided to the President? Sir, we are the very j
pivot upon which the nicely adjusted chocks j
and balances of the whole system hang and j
quiver; and ifeither scale bo made too light our '
function ie gone.
The great difficulty in the original con.
s'ruction'after Constitution was'to reconcile the
sectional and conflicting interests of a wide
extended and diversified empire. In the first i
place, there was the artificial division of-States |
separating us into various communities and !
political associations; and in the second place, !
there were the great permanent divisions of;
climate and soil, inducing, of course, the most !
striking d fT-rences in the industrial habits of?
the population. Besides these, there was the
accidental and most marked distinction of do.
mest?c slavery in one section.
Ail these required that, in any common j
C\ oUahIiI if f\X\ f* A Ko fflUfli] '
reason. Time is ofton a corrector. The space
betwoon the sessions of Congress would be

practically and in fact, the whole cdnfent be,
tween the Veto and the assembly, on subject# of
muoh exc tement, is a contest between 4* the
one-man power" on bdth sideg.
Upon the whole, Mr. Prcsidett, considering
that tho veto is pufelya conservative power; that
wo are linhle to more froquent and greater harm
tro-n rath legislation than from declining to act
without a numerous conourrenee; that the Rxecutive
denartment ought to be able to protect
itself in its peculiar sphere; that we secure a
more zealous exeoution of laws .-t the handa of
those who have not objee'ed to their enactment;
that the representative of all the sections and
a 11 Hip Stales may protect tho weaker againat

the theory on which our ancestors established the
veto, and thus far our history urns anrtiuncd
their wisdom.

We are indebted to the Hott. ^tlo. D.
SuMTfin for n copy of the report on
"Commerce and Navigation,"
Tho "Town Meeting" on Saturday Was
an apt illustration of the average practi.
cal operation of the doctrine of instruction
so much cherished by certain demagogues
and self styled "Democrats" of the pres.
ent day. The number of persons enti.
tied to vote for Town Council is more
then one hundred. At the "Town Meet,
ing" a division was called for on only one
question. On that, the ayes were six*
teen : the noes too few to need being
counted to decide the question. Now it
is assumed that the vote of these sixteen
is to be regarded by the Council as
instructions from (heir constituents, numbering
more thnn a hundred. Less than
a sixth is, by interpretation, made more
than half. Whether or not our Honorable
and respectable Council are Democratic
enough to adopt this mode of interpretation,
wc know not.
