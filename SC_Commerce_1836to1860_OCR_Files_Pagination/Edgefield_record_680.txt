LATEST FROM EUROPE.
North and South Amer. Coffee House,
Loi Dot. Monday July 4, 1642.
We take advantage of an Express from
this to Liverpool, to send you details of all
the most important and latest ntuelligenc,
which will be conveyed by the N. Ameri
can Mail Steamer Acadia.
During the whole of yesterday and to
day, LAndon has been in the uttmost ex
cited state in consequence of the appre
hension of another individual who is be
lieved to have intended an attempt on the
Queen's life, and this within but a few
boursof her Nlajesty's royal clemency hav
ing been extended towards the man Fran
cis, whom she had but jost sqved from the
severest penalty of the law.
The monster charged with the third at
tempt, seems to he some misshappen fiend,
whose appearance ouly bears comparison
with the foul deed wish which he seems
desirous to have distinguished himself. It
was on her Majesty's return from the Cha
pel Royal, yesterday, hat the wretch
seems to have intended his purpose; but
the whole affair seems so truly revolting
and opposite to the national character, that
we can scarcely briug our minds to credit
Al its truth.
Messrs. Sharp, Roberts & Co. the emi
nent engineers of Manchestcr. have dis
charged 300 of their operatives. One or
two cotton mills, it is -tated, are on the eve
of stapping their works.
Great progre-a has been making in the
gigantic undertaking of erecting a light
house on the Goodwin Satds. The cais
son is already plated perfectly air and wa
ter tight at low water mark.
The Senate at lamibrg has just pub
lished a third list of subseriptions towards
the relief of the sul'-er front the late lire.
The total anount received up to the 15th
tlt, was three nillious of tuarca blanco, i
about 4,800,000f.
A formal notire hart been :iven to Col.
Burnett. by the Pacla of Eypt. that the
trade of the next cotton crops' would he
free, and all would lIe at liberty to pur
chase them throughout Eaypt.
Our news from China is to the 4th of
April. The preparation for tqe defence
by the Chinese of the river between W ham
poa and Canton were still it prigres, al
though now nearly completed, and their
oflicers w ere unremitting tn their exertions
to practise their artillerytnen in the use of
great guns.
Several skirmishes had taken place along
the coast, but with to decisive result. al
though in each the enemy had suflered
considerable loss. More vigorous mea
sores were, it is said, in contemplation,
and a movement to the northward was in
tended upoo the arrival of the expected
re-inforcemeuts.
Trade appears to have been carried on
as usual, but, with the exception of cotton,
not upona remunerating prices. Barter was
the only means of commercial enterprise.

-parties seear incline d to trace this to the
over creative power of machinery than to
any other cause. There has been extreme
depression of late, owing to all parties
haying withdrawn trom hustness opera
tions until the passing ot the Tariff Bill
enables them to see clearly what steps to
take in their matters of retrular business
and speculation. The Tariff being now
settled, of course such causes are removed.
The proceedings in Parliatanent have
possessed no essential inerehl, business
having been devoted to the Income Tax
and the new Tariff questions, both of
which are now pascal, It is expected
that the business of the atession will he
bruught to a close abount thte '20th of this
month.
Pardon of I'rancis-Another . flack upon

Queen, has been reprieved. There does1
exist a doubt that the pistol was loaded

Upon detaching the barrel, which was
done with some difficulty, from the screw II
having becomze exceedinagly rusty, owinga
to its long disuse, there were found in it a
portion of very coarse powder, a piece at
tobacco-pipe, and some paper wadding.-c
Alis motive is supposed to be the same as lI
ihat of Franris.
Frac.-The intelligence from the I
Continent is at little interest, it we except la
the publication of the royal ordinance an
France, Imposing un ad valorem duty ot a
20 per cent. on all lineu yarn imported in- b
to the kingdom. As may be expected, I
such a revolutionary measure has produc- I

but it is expected the French government i
will submit to an amelioration. r

no hesitation in saying, every real Temperane
man. who has that cause and the cause of hi

That the editor of the Compiler, or his inform
ant, may have been mistaken, as regards it
r being the pledge of an orgacized body or noi
r makes no material difference,-that such
r pledgr has been in existence in the town a
Columbia, the editor of the Advocate does nn
deny,-and that it was the act of a number a
the citizens of that town, who are desirous o
making the Temperance cause answer the pnr
I pos of a rail wea, to carry themselves or the
friends into ofice. we presume the editor wit
not have the hardihood to deny:
lIUPledg.-j- We the undersigned, feelin,
tug' ns of maintaining oureletions fret
SImpoper infsences, do beriby pledgo
wepssopeusges.
As regard oar vio d the pledge, that ans.
ins as we are, and always have been for the
s,-ceof the Temperancecause, and ia whmic:
we have taken an interest in forwarding in thiu
district, should such doctrine as are contained
in that pledge, be introduced into the Societ'
at present existing here, or even atmonig an:
portion of our citizens, we would use our ut
most exertions to put it down, should it be al
the sacrifice of all that has been done to-vard,
the advancement of the Temperance cause.
W~e cannot conceive that it was ever intended
by the Brat movers in the cause of Temperanice,
that thme subjects of Ileligion or Politics shotl
in any way be connected with it, and all, whi
in any manner make use of the cause, fur then
purpose of creating Rteligious or Political ec.
citement, does all the injury that its w'orst ene.
mies could desire. So far as regards the nmmde
of treating by candidates during an electioneer.
ing campamign, we think they ought to be allow
ed to act as they deem best, and that ntman or
set of men have a right to dictate in what man.
'ner they shall act to ensure their election, so
long as the laws of the country are tnot tram.
pled upon by them. We coincide with the
editor of the Compiler in his opinion of the
manner in which the Temperance Sc'ieties
ought to act, and therefore use his language:
- Let thme Temperance reformation he car
ried ou In a becoming spirit. Agitate ! agitate
by temperance addre,.ses calcnlated to the un
derstanidings of all-portraying tihe evils and
ruin. whice. so ollen folnows in its, train ; and
not by condemning those whose business it is
to sell what constitutes the principal means of
support of many a f~Anmily in tihe upper parts min
this State. and wich pays a tax beneicmal to all
of us; they have a right to sell, to give and to
barter say what me, will, whether as a mcdi
cine or not is of no maiter to the seller, for he
is no public censor; so long in proportion as
the article is consumed. will it be sold as long
as it can be sold will it he manufactered. and
nom r.aw can prevent it. It is impolitic. wc think,
to hold forth such a pledge as the aobve, for it
is calculated to throw temperance farther lie.
hind than ever, for no waan would bind himself
to such condition, which no necessity calls for ;
and he holds hii suln'rage of too umuch value tom
make it subservienmt to any other than himself."
We have been inng convinced, that the mode
adopted by the editor of thme Temperanmce Ad.
vocate, of holding up to public view and ridi
cule, those persons who had made it their
business to deal in spiritous liquors, and that fo'r
tie purpose of making a living for themselves
and families.aa incorrect,and not in accordance
with the principles, which have, or at least
ought to be held out, by a newspaper, establish
d for the avowed purpose of bettering the con.
dition of'that portion of the community whmo
had unfortunatelt became addicted to the vice
of Drunkenness, as the mean. used in such
eases, should be of the mildest and most per
essive character, and not such as to cr eate a
hatred to the cause of Temperance, in the ho
gems of either the dealer or the consumer.
For our own part, we feel assured that ti~e
cause of Temperance has suffered in our dis
trict by a simtilar pledge or resolution having
been offered before the old Temperance Sac,
ty, but we are proud in being able to say that
themr wasanot enoughbfawetics in that body to
.adopt it
Our hopes are, that all Teetotal Abstinence w
Societies, will denounce any man or sett of t
men, who shall so far forget the respect due to
the Temperance body to wtich he or they may b
belong, as to initroduce at any of their meetings,
any Prealbles or it..solutions. which will in e
any manner have for thecir object the interfer.
ence with Religious or Political matters. e

For the Adrertiser. r
Mr. EnrTon.-In an account of the arrest of 11
Wiley Freeman. published in tile N 0. Picay i
une, and copied it, tile Charleston Courier and i
other papers throughout the Union, I see that
Freeman atempts to excuse himselforle mur
der of his wife, by saying it was all my fault.
That I may do justice to myself, and to her s
name. which this man now ittempts to soil, af
ter cruelly murdering her. I deem it n-cessary
to give the loblic a short statene ut of the rela
tion in which I stood and acted towards both
Freeman and his wife, and let thee public draw
their own couclusions.
Mrs. Freeman being a first cousin of mine.
and living most unhappily with her husband.
from the period of three months after their mar.

thing its nay power to render hter condition bet

for hin to transfer to me a sum of money to be
vested inl property for the use and benefit of his
wife and children. After this, I consented ti be

of long standing. And that he might injure me.
he expiesscd lhi determinatin orlenvicig a tract

a husband who had become a beastly sat. and
e whose daily earnings scarcely suficed to supply
e hais growing desire for drink. refused to go. be.
