IN offering to the patronage ol li.e public, a new 1 ^
literary paper, we are pertecfy uwaro that wo ,
are bat repealing an oil-trie ! t-uietiuit ut. The re-1
t?ultv Lowever, we would lam !<? .eve, will be diitoreut.
Wo tue. it is true, Conscious of tin* possession i
ot* no talent or ability sup -nor to taut ot'our predo
ccssors. b it wv rely, (perhaps, indeed, with too
much ol the ardor of all experiments,) upon the increasing
taste of the age of literature ; u tnste, the
evidence of which is before us in the number of periodicals,
engaged solely in its cultivation?in the
lyoeuuis, the libraries ami academies devoted to scienoo
and learning. Whilst the North and the .
West are thus assidiously employed in the exeni*
plary task of mental improvement, we will not sup- | {
pose that the South intends longer to bear the | j
weight of that heavy incuinbns which heretofore'!
lias whclmeJ it 111 an intellectual slumber more t
last in; and profound tlian that physical one which <
crewhile enwrapped the seven sleepers of hlphesus. <
It is with a hope tints founded, and with an in- <
tention ifwecaunot win succes3,at least to deserve i
it; that iiolwilhstau ling the uniform failure of tnose
who liave preceded us, we have ventured to claim
the patronage and to labor for the applause ol the

gimu is to end, time only cm determine.
Our object will be to render the col mini cl the ,
Bulletin both useful and amusing. For this purpose,
while one p >rli<>n is devoted to original IdsBays,
Tales and Poems, furnished from time to time
by our Correspondents and collaborators, another
portion shall be occupied by selected ma'tor culled
from every spot of interest and instruction, in the
va-t tield of liter iture.
The productions of the press shall pass in ieview
before us, and on every work which merits our i
notice, an impartial criticism shall be bestowed ?
To light luarature and to learned science shall alike '
be meted their due portion cl censure or uf praise,
and it shall not be our faults if our patrons do not
know the intrinsic value of every book, (at least in '
vnr own opinion) before they l*)gin to tead.
lie, says Or. 1 ranklin, \vl?o is good at excuses, is
Seldom good at any thing else; and the same we !
opine may be Baid of promises; lest therefore our ,
readcis copnc to some such conclusion as this, we
will, without furihsr ado, make our b<>w, a <1 louvo
them in future to judge from <?ui labor,; whetn r we
<lo, or do not, deserve their patronage.

THE MUSICAL DEPARTMENT
Is under the supervision of Air. J. Watson, whost
qualifications for the task are too well known to re
. quire our testimony.
This department of the Ladies' Companion, hai
ever commanded a large share of att> ntion, and In
been looked upon with no little interest by its re t
ders, and more especially the Ladies, whom tin
publisher is in the burliest leirree nnvi.nn In
^ rj r "
! It will continue to he a subject of more than n-oni
rare to him, and to the Prv.fe*-or under whose sn
pervisio it is placed, to make tlint portion of tin
magazine allotted to music, more than ever doscniuj;
of the countenance of every lover of music. !t hot
ever Iwon and will continue to he the desire to hav?
ill pieces of music printed correctly and free Iron
errors.
THE WOIUv IV GF.NP R \L.
Over every department an equally careful super
vision will he strictly exercised bv the F.dilors ?n?!
all appropriate expenditures will lie lilxrally hollowed
as it is the design ofthc publisher with the aid of his
contributors and the advice of his friends to make
the Ladies' < 'otnpanton distieguishc I for the lieauty
I and accuracy of its typography?the variety and
| high tone of its literary articles?the quality and
value ot its music?and the unequalled splendor ol
its pictorial cinbelibh merits.
It is the determination of tlie publisher to use every
means to maintain tin* superiority which the Lulus'
Companion has obtained. For four years he
has steadily pursued n cou'se ol improvement, and
lie llatiers himself that his present facilities are such
os (ogive the Ladies' Companion eminent advantages
overall other publications of its character.
From the foregoing it will he perceived that the
Ladies' Companion embraces every department within
the range of Belle*-Lett res and the Fine Arts;
and no exertions or ? xponse will he deemed too great
to render tho work equal to any other extant, f'he
(l ittering and general testimonials of nearly every
contcmparary journal in the United States, and in
fact, many on the other side of the Atb.ntie
strongly averted the Undeniable claims of the La- i

great return for their subscription.
