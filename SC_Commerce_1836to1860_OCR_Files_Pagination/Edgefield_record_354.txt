Dear Sir-Allowv me, through thme col

the humane fanatics of the North, that
little damage need be apprehended from
the Cannibalistic "Dogs of War," lately
brought from Cuba to rid this Territory of
its honorable and much abtused aborigines
(as some are pleased to term them.)
Eleven of these Florida blood hounds, a
lias Cuba curs, are now at this point, feast
iug upon their six pounds of fresh beef
each per day. They have been tried fre
quently within the last few days, with ain
]ndian, a prisontier de guene at this place,
and if they will take his trail, it would be
hard to prove it by those who were pres
ent. I have no confidence bowever, in
them.
As to their ferocity, it is all humbttg
a child may fondle with them. They
have been more grossly misrepresented
thtan any set of anitnals in the world-the

Col. Twiggs, with a large command of

leave, here on-Thursday next, for a grand

"TheFederal Army of Mexico after
making an unsuccessful attack on Mounte

convention was held at Larado (a town on
the left. bank of ihe Rio Grand,) which
declared its independence from Mexico,
organized a provisional government for
the 'RepublicofRin Grande,'and installed
a General Council: Jests deGardenas, a
lawyer by profession, and lately Political
Chief of the Nothern department of Tam
aulipas, was elected President of the Re
public: Gen. Antonio Canales was inves

army.
"The new government is calling for
volunteer aid, and expects to reciove it
from Texas and the United States, it is
said that it will be more liberal with the

government ever was. The property of
the Church and-Convents, including their
large landed estates, will be appropriated

which was not obtained from the post office

Central leaders at Maitamoras, that there
was a probability of eflecting an amicable

and their followers, who were in possession
of tie Centralists, had been marched to

degree ofgenerosity, we must be permitted
to say, we believe the Mexican Centralists
incapable of exercising.] That Gen.
Arista had in his port folio 2000 indultos,

We find in a late New Orleans Com
nercial Bulletin the following remarks, in
relation to .the exposed condition of the
frontier of Louisiana:
"The exposed condit ion of our frontier
settlements on the West, has at tracted the
tiotice of the Legislature o f the State. No
ittle apprehension has for some time been
felt for the safety of the parishes near the
lexian boundary. The adjacent wvilder
ness is occupied by turbulent trtbes,smar
ing from the infliction of fancied wrongs,
nd thirsting for revenge against the white
men, who have driven them from their
homes East of the Mississippi into the wvil
lerness and wild exile. At present the
rontir of Louisiana is in a defenceless
state. Along its whole extent there is not
isgarrison capable ofopposing the march
>a thosand savages. In case of an in
vasion, the only relinance of the settlers
would be upon their own resources. The
militia of the country are, no doubt, capa
ble of defending themselves, if properly
ganmzd, and prepared for hostilities.
But the onsets of the Indians are always
udden. Their plan of warfare is to take
he enemy by surprise; and, after having
pread havoc aod massacre through the
settlement, to fly and make their escape,
efore the inhabitants have an opportunm
ty to gesembla a snfficment force to pursue

is needed, which can furnish troops ready
for sudden-emergencies. The process of
asembling militia is slow and difficult
[t takes time to complete their organiza

may do all the mischief, and fly beyond

might be mentioned,-the estubliUnseat or

adventure:
I turn from the legislature to give' an
item which smacks of romance and nov

in company with Judge- Bodley, a fair
faced and juvenile passenger in pantaloons
arrayed, and on stopping at the mansion
of Madam Dixon, the said personage was
consigned to a room in company with Sen
ator Thos. B. Rives.
In a few minutes suspicions were set
afloat that the. stranger aforesaid was a
woman, whereupon Mrs. Dixon in curious
trepidation, repaired to the presence of
her new guest. "You are a woman,"
said Mrs. D. "I know I am," replied the
stranger, "but listen to my story." .She
then related an adventure that far eclipsed
the dangers braved by the lover of Orlan
do,ihe had been cruelly treated, her bus
bond fled the country, and resolved to
find him, she changed her dress, and went
to the Mississippi River, where she secured
a berth on one of the steam boats as cabin
boy. This life she followed up and down
the western waters for eight months; des
pairing of the object of her auxious pur
suit she is now on her way to the bosom
of her family in one of the eastern coun
ties of Mississippi.
When her sex was discovered. several
ladies and gentlemen recalled her acquaint
aUce, and by the kindness of her friends,
she was soon transformed and conducted
to the parlor, glittsring in all the splendor
of her sex. The stories she told were in
tensely interesting and all true-while a
cabin boy she had two or three fights, in
all of which she came off victorious!
Who will say the Mississippi ladies are
not brave and do not love? We intend
to write the history of this lady for one of
the antnuals; the materals are ample, In

We made up our mind not to blemish

with the dissonance of even just complaint
and it is with pain, and, far more in sor
row than in anger, that we feel constrain
ed in a separate article to make an unpleas
ant allusion in.connexion with a subject
from which above all others, we wished to
exclude and exorcise the accursed fiend
of party.' We think, however, that the
members of the Union party have been
treated with a singular and unaccount
able want of delicacy and kindness, on
both occasions when - they assembled,
in amity and fraternal feeling, with
their old political opponents, to pay a com
mon tribute to the beloved and lamented
object of the late imposing ceremonial.
At the call of the City Council, the.citi
zens of Charleston and the Neck, without
distinction of party, met at the city Hall,
in order to mingle tleir sorrow, and vote
a joint tribute of respect, on the occasion,
which had deprived our country. of such
an eminent citizen as Gen. Hayne-one,
who, but a short period before, had re
ceived from our community, then recent
ly emerged from a party conflict of un
common fierceness and rancour, the ex

the first salaried Mayor of the City.

how deep.their blush of shame for others,

majority of which were, and are Union men,
their unqualified assent challenged to the
doctrine of State interposition, or nullifi

ledged oppressions of the general govern

deceased, an unwillingness to make his
obsequies a scene of wrangling-an hon
orable delicacy-kept their lips silent then
although their bosoms boiled with a just
indignation-therefore they forbore and
they forgave-and they were eien willing
to unite in further honors to the illustrious
dead, in the hope, nay confidence, that
they would not again be alike wounded
and aggrieved. Yesterday, they came
once more, in the full expansion of brother
ly feeling, to lay a common oblation of
grief and honor on the tomb of HAYX
and we mourn to say it; that their feel
ings were grated and their patieneg abused
by a long and elaborate exposition and
vindication of the doctrines of nullification.
We charge on the Orator no exhibition of
ill-feeling, no unkind intention; he thought
perhaps, that he was but speaking history
-but his taste and his judgment were
sorely at fault, and misled him intoacourse
necessarily offensive to a large portion of
his audience, who went there to honor the
dead, not to be instructed by the living in
theories of Government or party creeds.
This part of the Oration was-indeed most
onoxiously out of place-as much so as
if the Union party, on the occasion of the
death of one of their distinguished mem
bers, were to invite their once alienated,
but now reconciled brethren, to com
mingle their sorrows for the dead and
the Union eulogist were to forget him
self so much a6 to intrude into his dis
course an exposition and vindication
of Unionism, as the opposite of nulli

The doctrine advocated by Gen. M'
Duffie, of course, meets now, as it has ev
er met, our unqualified dissent. We op
pose to it a doctrine hallowed by the shade
of Washington, and embraced by an im
rmensely preponderating majority of the
States of the Union-and wve accept the
tribunal, to whidh he refers the arbitre
metnt of the question,-posterity. The
past sends up its approbation of otur creed,
from the graves of our illustrious ancestors,
the present brings us the overwhelming
approval of millions of freemen, and we
court with confidence the award ofthefu
ure. When his Eulogy shall be published
as we suppose it will lbe, wve shall take oc
casion to enter the lists more formally with
General M'Dufle. In the mean time we
beg leave respectfully to remind him that
it was he who taught us. that "if, after the
National judiciary have solemnly affirmed
the constitutionality of a law, it is still to
be resisted by the State rulers, the consti
tution is literally at an end; a revolution
of the Government is already accomplish
e, and anarchy waves his horrid sceptre
over the broken altars of this unhappy
Union."
We have written the foregoing remarks
without any feeling either towards Gen.
MDufie, or the other parties concerned:
ur editorial, yesterday, shews the spirit in
whih wve went to the funoral celebration,
-and we repent that it is with unfeigned
sorrowv that we find the necessity of this
article imposed upon us by the injudicious
course of others. But we also repeat that
we can forgive much to brethren, and,
however ungenerously we may have been
served, we wvill not unbury the -hatchet at
the tomb of HAYNE-on the contrary, we
would rather enter into a generous rival
ry with our opponents to see who can bury
it the deepest.
In relation to Gen. Hayne, wye must be
permitted to say that we yield to none in
esteem for his character, veneration, and
gratitude for his virtues and services, and
honor to his tnemory, and we add here,
what under other circumstances, it may
have been improper for us to pen,) so
thoroughly were our party differences heal

to his death weo enjoyed the honor of his
personal friendship and confidence.

The Lug Cabin and 11ard Cider Can

Harrison, their candidate for the Presiden
cy, " Log Cabin and Hard Cider." Sotse.
body has said that he neer- did live :in
a log cabin, or drink hard cider, whenever
he'could get any thing better. I issedrce
ly necessary to say, that his guod friends
have bestowed upon him the title merely
ad captanduii Vulgus.
We copy the subjoined humorous re
marks upon "Old Tip," and the virtues
of hard cider, from the New York Eve
ning Post.
The.accomplishmint of drinking hard
cider, possessed by oue of the candidates
for the Presidency of the United States, is i
still insisted upon in certain quarters with
great enthusiasm. At one of the recent
processiona of the friends of Harrison, the
words hard cider wete conspicuously dis.
played on one of the banners; the image
of a cider barrel and pitcher has become a -
favorite device with a certain.set of politi
cians, and we are told of a certaii knot
of them who ineet every evening at a tav
ern which bears that sign. The Balti
more Patriot, of yesterday morning, has
a wood cut representing the dwelling of
Harrison, with a barrel of hard cider be
fore the door, and a huge pitcher in the
window.
It is intended, no doubt, by this expedi
ent to obtain popularity for Harrison. I
"Old hickory," was an appellation which 1
many of the admirers of General Jackson
were fond of giving him. The Whigs are
imitative, and ready to take any method
of catching popularity except the true one,
that of acknowledging popular rights..
They have doubtless considered that both
hickory and hard cider begin with the let
ter h, and that both are hard, and hence
by an ingenious analogy, conclude that if
General Jackson, under the appellation of I
"old hickory," became President of the
United States, Harrison will infallibly
succeed by being called the "hard cider
candidate."
There is, doubtless, much virtue in hard
cider, but it is worthy of inquiry whether ]
it will impart the proper qualifications for j
the Presidency, even to him who drinks it
most diligently. "gCoffe" says Pope,
---".Coffee makes the politician wise
And sle throtigh all things with his half shut
eyes." .
Hath hard cider not only a similar but far I
superior potency 7 Can you make a I
statesman out of a barber's block by put
ting it into a pickle of hard cider?
We are told by Ovid that Medea res
tored Eson, her husband, when in the
last stage of decay and decrepitude, to
youth, strength and beauty, by filling his
body with the pungett juices of herbs. I
Fessenden has thus versified his account
of the process:
" MAedea cut the withered weasand
Orsnperannuated Eson,
Then filled him up with acrid juices
Ofiettleto2s and flower-de-btces,
When, frdh the defttnct carcase, lo!
Started a dashing Bond-street bean."
Could she have performed the same feat
wiih hard c~jder? Can we take
a foolish fend old man;
Mute shined against, than sinning
such as we believe Harrison to be, and by 3
soaking him in hard cider, transform him
into a Nestor, subtlest of men, the wisest
as well as the oldest warrior of the camp,
whose faculties have only been made keen.
er by age ? Has hard cider the property F
attributed by Falstairto sherris sack, and I
ascending into the brain," or to use a more V
familiar phrase, getting into the head of
a
the WVhig candidate for the Presidency,.
has it "dried there all the foolish, and I
crudy vanrours which environ it? These r
are important questions, and tmust not be
pretermitted by the Whig party, if they
intend to found the pretensions of their
candlidate upon the fact of his drinking
hat1d cider. 1
But even allowing the habit of drinking e
hard cider to be thus beneficial to the in
tellect, we have our doubts whether some
thing more is not required in a President. ~
Is that accomplishment a suflicient offset I
against a act of principles dangerous to r
the public liberty and peace? Is it not ||
possible that flarrison, with his mind cul
tivated and strengthened by the drinking
of hard cider, may yet propose or assent e
to bad measures atnd follow a pernicious p
system of policy ?
- Is it worth while, for the sake of promo
ting to the Presidency, a man who drinks
hard cider, to allow Mr. Clay and his par- d
ty to govern the country according to their d
plans ? Is it worth while to go back to e
the burdens of a high tariff and a costly a
system of internal improvement; to res

his word made use of in this countrynin 6;
hort, it is a species of mercantile phi-ase, ni
et it applies to any thing specially fine
ut we could never get hold of its deriva

uthority of a gentleman recently from

ometimes a proclamnationi, or a hand-bill,
r a letter, or a law; and chop-chop means e
ery fine, or very strong, or first rate.
['here are various ways ini expressing pre- ce

ninstructive, to touch the roots of these is,

We are pleased to learn, by the com
iunication of " A Graduate," the pros
erity of the Georgia Medical College.
Ve are not among those, if such there be,
rho indulge an ungenerous jealousy of
n institution dedicated to science, because
:is established ip another State. We ds
ot fear that the Georgia College will in
ire our own excellent Medical Institution
:Charlesion. There is need for both, in
'te Southern community. Both, it is
oped, will vie in a generous rivalry'with
ach other, in imparting the best instruc
ion to those young gentlemen who are
ngaged in the study of a high and res
,onsible profession. Both, we trust, will
eceive the support of an enlightened pub
c. But a few years since, there was no
ledical College, we believe, in the South
rn States. Our young men were comn
elled to go to Northern Institutions, to re
eive the instruction necessary for their
rofession. These, excellent as they were,
id not meet the wants of Southern Sta
ents. A Medical College was establish
I in Charleston, South Carolina, and for
number of years, has been in successful
peration. It is now ranked among the
rst in the United States. Two or three
ears since; another Southern Medical
'ollege was established at Augusta, Ga.,
ad young as it is, it has attained a high
respectable standling among the institn
Dne of a similar character. To use' the
nage of our correspondent, we believe
ist its "prosperity is placed beyond all
,ubt."
