HI. Readjustment of the TariffUnder
this h?*ad the Secretary of the
Treasury, adverts to the change to be effected
hi the collection of imposts af'er
next June, according to the act of 1S33,
which requires cash payments, instead
of credits as have hitherto been allowed;
and he advises the continuance of this
provision of that act. He next adverts
f *
to the provision of the same act which
requires the impost* to be collected ad valoremu
or according to the value of the
1 C5
goods at the ports where they are en
tered. The Secretary prefer* specific to
ad valorem duties, and dwells upon the
difficulty of adjusting ad valorem duties
according to home valuation, on account
of the ever racy trig prices of the same
article in the rna'ket. and its different
J
values often, at different ports. Flo advises,
some change in- I he law to obviate
these difficulties.
Ditirimi tuition in favor of Miwi fcctmx.
On this head the Secretary wcite* as
follows:
But. in the second pla^e. if f'on^rcsv
should be of opinion either that homo
valuation is practicable, or that some
equivalent and proper substitute may be

' foundfor it, the undersigned will not di*. ?
guise his opinion that it cannot be regard- ?
! ed its wise, by any portion ot the country, ?
as a permanent system of policy, to aug- ?
[ ment the amount of revenue, when fur- I
ther exigencies may require such aug. i
mentation, bv raising duties on all ?
i articles, including those of absolute <
i necessity, t<? the lull extent of twenty per i
'cent., and preserving- that limit, at fhej?
j same time, as a.* fixed harrier against j
j higher duties on any article whatever, I
| eve i those of more luxury. Such a plan I
of revenue, if to be regarded as a 8"ltled t
system, appears to the undersigned to be ; I
unnatural and inconvenient, and such as 1
is not likeiv to promote the best interests i
of the country. |
" The probable effect of the future opera- j <
tion of the act of ly*33 upon the manufne. |
tures and mechanical trades of the conn, i I
try, particularly if no home vnlnatinn he :i
; established, and no equivalent for such ' <
home valuation found, gives rise to an I
inquiry too important to be overlooked,
j I? is fully acknowledged that all duties i
should bo laid with primary reference to
revenue, and it is admitted, without UcsU
tntion or reserve, that no more moneyshould
he raised, under any pretence
whatever, than such amount H8 is necessary
for an economical administration of
| the 'Government. But within these lini
lis nun h*1 incie.oniai 10 inn r>tiKini> ??
-such revenue a_> muv he absolutely nccessiry,
it is believed that discrimination
may ho maTj, and duties imposed in such
manner as that, while no part of th?
i country will suffer loss ?n inconvenience
' a most beneficial degree of protection wil'
! he extended to the Unor and industry o
| large masses of the people, wiiile the wind
country will ho rendered more prosperou
in peace, and infinitely stronger and bet
ter prepared if foreign war should comi
upon ns. The principle 01 discriminaltoi
I has obtained from the period or the foun
. dation of the f*overnment. In man*
! cases it may be found to he indispensabl<
j to the in'eresls of the revenue itself; am
if, in fixing a system of duties, it consists
with the best interests and true policy of
I the country so to apportion them among
j the various species of imports as to favor j
I our own manufactures at the same time
i that the revenue itself is benefitted, and
j no injustice done to any, it would seem 1
I proper and wise to reject arbitrary limits
I an 1 the idea of a forced and unnatural
uniformity. 1
The undersigned feels no difficulty in
l admitting that a duty of twenty per cent,
lad valorem, assessed upon the value of"
j imported articles in our own ports, would
1 in many instances be a rate sufficientfy j
J high for the benefit of the revenue, and al- j
!-o afford reasonable encouragement to 1
] home producers of the same articles. As 1
j fo those, therefore, the object of the art
J of 1833 will be accomplished, if its pro- 1
| visions for home valuation he carried out
j by Congress.' But he still supposes that |
there are several descriptions cf imported !
manufactures and produce, which would i
well bear a higher duty than twenty per <
rent, upon the home value, and fhusyield 1
j a greater revenue to the Government, J
! while, in regard to some of thein, it will '
i he found that, without such increased du-' I
| iv, tile labor of large classes, engaged in 1
1 producing similar articles, will he greatly j <
depressed, if not entirely supplanted. ! I
It is unquestionably true. and well j I
worthy of remark, that the act of 1833 ;
w is avowedly conservative in its objects ! I
and character; and while it was designed j '
i to rentove what was esteemed a grievance '
| * % . * '
hv one part of the country, it was n:tjt
i intended that the interests of any other '
: should be sacrificed by it. On the con- i J
j irarv. a reasonable security was intended 1
I for all. Its true spirit, therefore, will bo I
| but carried out by acting, under any new j1
...... . r ... ?..^ I iiiiK rufnrt^nnn to ! I
j MUiC <l| t imilll.-JHillvi#, niki! |<
; tho same gn at objects. and doing justice .
j alike to all. The great principle of that j
i art was moderation and conciliation, and ;
j this should never he lost sight of. But ;
j the measures proper and necessary to
i carry out that principle may be changed, I
J if the altered circumstances or the conn- '
1 try call for siich change, without any j
( departure from the principle itself. |
Nothing is more established bv our ex-1
. I
i perience, and the jxpertence of other.
! nations, than that the augmentation of i
j duties does not augment, in nn equal de- j
I gree, the mst of the article to the con- !
Isomer. In many cases it appears not to
; increase ttint x*ost at nil. Very often j
I the price lo the consumer is kept down, j1
r.ot withstanding an increase of duties, j '
I p.iitly hv the greater supply of the hom? j4
p eduction, and partly by the reduction of j'
the price in the foreign marked. It is i1
believed, indeed, thai there have been!'
cases in which the jo*nt operation of the 1
'two causes has occasioned price* to fall 1
, iower than they were before the increase '
1 of duties whs laid.
This re.-ult in the operation of trade (
jnnfl business might readily be traced to '
, its causes; but a full exposition of those '
j causes, a,nd the modes of their operation. 4
J would too jnucb swell this report. Sill* '
J rice it to say that, when an additional 1
j duty is laid on an article in a country in (
which that uilicit '* extensively con- 1
, suined. the burden always falls in part, '
and sometimes, as experience has shown. | *
altogether, upon the foreign producer, j The
foreign producer must sell; and if. '
i i:i the place of sale, he finds an article 1
produced on the spot which AOiues into J
aoMintagcous competition with own 4
* Ln fcUlII I '
oy reason 01 paying no
must sell, and* lor tlie sake of fining able; I
(o ?lo ir. lie must he content to bear the *i
burden of the duties himself. Tin# duty '
home hv I he foreign producer in such I
eases is Jikej (he charge for transports- 1
lion?it is something which is necessary *'
to i#rmg him into the market of compeliii'on.
Analogous instances occur in
thuneslic trade. The wheat-grower of
Indiana, who incurs heavy expenses in ^
conveying his dour to an Atlantic port,
ixpecta no higher price for it when it
irrive* there then is peio for flour of th?
(erne quality to producers in file iminodiHe
neighborhood. The coat of transpor* N
alion. therefore, doe* not operate en th
much to raise ih? price at the place of' ^
inle as lo dimmish it at the ptacebf piro.'
lection. Now, the greet lew which reg. " *
ulntcs prices, by dftinend and supply. h?
dernly observed in cases of foreign inrjortation.
as in this instance of domestic j
trade. The undersigned cannot forbear)10
to add, that vastly the greater proportion ) IV
if the agricultural population of the tJni. 1
ted Slates is obliged to relv mainly upon ci
the homo market for a sale of its products. t*
although a large part of thusc products b
[wheat, for instance) is such a* often ?
enters extensively into the consumption n
of the world. The quantity of flour and g
Indian corn exported from this country I ^
h altogether inconsiderable, in comparis- j p
hi with the quantity consumed in the f
large cities nnii manufacturing towns,
w'ich Pave either entirely grown up .or
added largely to their population under
(ho influence of laws of Congress, |>as*ed
since the end of the last war, upon do p
mestic labor and ind,.stry. The immense
interchange of products, nil being the re. 0
suit of labor, which now taken place he- 0
twecn the producers of subsistence and
the population above mentioned, showily
the advantage which ofie class 'is tfniltihel ^
?thor, and the essential iniportanco to
both of preserving their existing relations. 0
If the consumption of flour ami grain -in jr
lie manufacturing districts, aspecially-.p
he-North and East, decline, to thtit ex. 3
cnt there is an absolute loss to the wheat ,|
id corn-grower, since the quantity con. n
irned hv theni will find a market no. jf
vliere else. To sav nothing, in thi#con. ^
texion. of the incalculable importance of
\ home market to the producer of the
rreat article of cotton, and limiting his J(
remark"! to the grain-growers, alone, the I
indersigncd cannot hut persuade himself! j|
hat nil will sec and acknowledge the ^
.Treat value to that class of producers of ^
flio Northern and Eastern market?the ?
inly considerable market, indeed, which
s permanently open to them upon1 the jj
face of the earth. gj
So long as the policy of other countries r<
^hall continue to exclude the product* of
our agriculture from their ports, and thus n
deny to us the advantage of a fair reci. '
procity in trade, it would appear to he
equally the dictate of policy and of justice
to our People to secure to them, as J j
far as nmy be reasonably and proj?rrlv
lone, n market of consumption for their t(
produce in their own country. '
Inrrratc. of the Recmitc. a,
The undersigned is of opinion that the ^
condition of the Treasury and of the; #>
country demands an augmentation of the j
revenue. It cannot hut he the true poli. j(
L'V of the Government to extinguish the
amount of debt now existing as. soon as I ft
practienhle, and to avoid increasing it. j ^
The cruation of deht, by loans and other ^
resorts, for revenue to supply deficiencies
of regular income, cannot hut he reganied. f||
in a time of peace, as injudicious and oh. ^
|ectionahle. The generj.1 fcredit of the M
[iovernment, always good, has been great. s(

[he fact that it has fully paid off and di*. (^
harged the deht created by the Revnlu- c
lion and hv a subsequent war with Eng.
and, and wars with the Indian tribes.? ol
Flie preservation of this high credit is of ^
[he utmost importance. It must he the j |
necessary reliance of the Government. Lo

arid honor anil of the Government, are the
means of inspiring that general confi- (*'
donee which shall at all times enable it to 111
jsc its cr? dil to the greatest advantage. I><
The estimated expenditures of the Gov.
srnmont for the coming year will exceed tl
its proimhle inenqne hy 814.218.570 68. w
Should Congress authorize a reissue of is

1. Because a public debt is a great j "r

The repudiation" prin-ipleof G.o#
IMcNutt, of >li.vi>sip ?i, just put forth,
we are pained to see, runs like wild.firo
among certain presses io the interior of
the State* we have named. It is presetted
as popular, that American Farmers shall
not sweat mid toil to pay debts to the n*.
hobs of England; and it is a degrading ^
thought, that the idea captivates hundred*
upon hundreds of otherwise honest mind*.
The Farmers, indeed, arc told, Lilt the**
on holts have swindled thoni out of their
bonds; that the plan 10cheat and defraud
them has been deliberate, and the 4nly
remedy, therefore, is repuditHion!
The argument* that respectable prestos
of the opposition, *mdi as th>* Evening
IV, and Phila elph a Pe?n*ylraiii*i?,
hav. put forth, to defend Cov. M-?S It . ,
in 1 * pudiatioo of a p.art f lie KotnH
of Mi-sissippi, many of the peases of tho
interior confound as a dof n<v of list
whole system of swindling. Tlx- ivtvtoruliftt

ho. estly differ about the principle, r?f.
rupis ill* whole puNSir mind of (be oppife

a party cju -stion, and to rally what
is called the dcinocrncv*' upon the prineiple,
