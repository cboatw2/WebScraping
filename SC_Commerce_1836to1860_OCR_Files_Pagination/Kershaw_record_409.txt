FLORIDA WAR.
Last attack of the Indians.?A g<
tleman resident of this city, just arriv
from Florida, has furnished us with I
following account of a bold attack of I
Indians on a steamboat.
The steamboat Irwinton, Capt. I3ro\i
from Apalachicoia bound to Columb
when below the town of Irwinton a
above the military post, was fiied into fn
the shore, by Indians. The Irwinton It

yife and child, (tor New Yow,) Jud
Spang, Mr. Motehncr of Georgia, a
others. Capt. Crown having peceived
veral smokes on shore, suspected India
were in the neighborhood, and adtis
the passengers to retire to the cabin.
They had only done so when a volly v
fired, killed the cabin bov, named Jo
Gill of Pittsburg. The Indians fired fr<
both shores. Some of the bullets pass
through the cabin, and the passengi
threw themselves upon the floor and <
capcd the shots. The pilots also c;
themselves upon the deck, and were t
hurt. The Capt. was at this time beh
crowding the tires. An alarm was n<
given that the boat was crowded with !
dians, " ami we are lost."
Alongside of the boat was a loaf
barge which she was towing up, on whi
they got, and then entered the steam
Eleven of those scondrels came ofi" in

capsized lliu canoe with the. olhor cig
who were passed floating down. Two
the Indians who got on board the |gwint
were killed by the engineer and ma
who knocked them down with wrcntch
and threw them into the wheel whi
they were torn to pieces. The third, w
appeared to be the leader, and who si
posed his men were with him, entered t
cabin calling loudly lo the others to f
low him. Most of the passengers hail 1
themselves, and the Indian posted hi
self at the head of the table apparcn
waiting a moment for reinforcement. A
P. Hendricks seized a chair, as the 01
weapon of defence at hand, when the ch
threw a chair at him across the table. A

Indians vs. Steam.?A gentleman w

the alleged attack of Indians on the stca:
boat Irwinton, informed us that the win
affair was a mere spree got up for t
purpose of frightening a Polish Jew pc

' The decision of this important question rests solely ;

the that an emphatic negative will be heard from every :

vice in awakening the public mind to the magnitude j

of the overshadowing evils of intemperance, and if
J j it is sustained, as we hope it will be, we may con

j apply a prompt and efficient remedy. A part from

' j well deserves the patronage of tho public. Tho

ip- j arc delegates from this country. There may also be
he others, but those arc all whose names we have seen
ol- mentioned. Of course the abolition of slavery
lid throughout the world, but more particularly in the
HI- United States, is the grand object of this august as.
Uy scmblage. To effect this, we learn that the most j
lr. powerful exertions will be made to destroy, if possi>Iy
i ble, the Cotton trade between Great Britain1 and the
ief Southern States of the Union. The government of
If. j Great Britain is to be recommended and urged to aid
? a the East India Company in promoting this humane
en | object. The abolitionists hope, and expect, by the
i'l encouragement which the government will be in1
' I
tic , duccd to give to the culture of Cotton in India, to
i l . 1 I
?1C drive the planters of the South into their views, by j
l?-1 so lessening the value and productiveness of slavo I,

m- j that in the course of a violent pliillipic against the (

he ; States of Virginia and Maryland sent seventy or ,
id- ! eighty thousand slaves ajycar to tho South, where, ,

City or Austin, June 1st, 1840.
Having a good opportunity to have i
letter eonveyed to New Orleans, I avai
myself of it.
Our town, and in fart the business o
the whole country, is vesy dull, from tin
continued depreciated stale of our enr
rcncy. It is getting worse, and is now
comparatively worth nothing. I am get
ting heartily tired of drauling out mj
existence where no prospect is to be seer
of a better stale of aiiliirs. I have jus:
returned from a very pleasant trip to Bexar
Df two weeks' duration, in company will

ordered over to suppress a mutiny in tlw
regular army, which was easily accom

V "t? ?j -lo
thst city, which since its foundation ir
Lhe early part of the seventeenth century,
[I think) has been one continued scene ol
blood and slaughter, an 1 which is sacred
is the resting place of Milam, Travis,
Bowie,and Crockett. It is an old Spanish
town, situated on the Rio San Antonio,
two miles from its head. The houses are
jf a soft kind of stone, one story high,
ill of which arc in a bad state of repairs;
the streets ruh at right angles, four ol
ivhich lead into the public square in the
sentre of the town. An old church ol
he same material as the surrounding
louses stands in the square. This square
ivas the position occupied by Cos, in 1835,
vhen the town was taken by Milam by
lorm. It was defended by a piece of canion
placed at the entrance of each of the
streets, while the church and ncighboiing
muses were covered with the enemy.?
riic Americans gained possession of the
lonses contiguous to the square by means
of "ditches, dug across tnc streets, irom
ivliich for three days a continued fight was
kept up, but the advantage of position ami
numbers on the side of the Mexicans,
ivas no barrier to the indomitable spirit oi
Milam and his men, who compelled them
to surrender. The Alamo is famous as the
place, where a handful of Americans successfully
bafiled a large force for a length
of time under the command of St. Anna,
md when it did fall, fell as the strong
man, and the bones of the flower of that
irrny lay before its walls. It stands on
the opposite side of the river from the
main town, and at one day was a very
strong fortress. The population of Bexai
is with but few exceptions, entirejy iviexi
can, (most of whom are women,) of al
most every degree of color and beauty
from the beautiful features and transpa
rent skin of the descendants of the ol<
Castilians, to the rude and mongrel mixturi
of the Degro and Indian. Fandangos, o

p to be tbe principal amusemenl of moat of mm
h the inhabitants. There were two or three |
n going on every night while we stayed in
u town. Iundarstood from my American GUI
e friends there, that this ball is only atten- ta
c ded by the lower order of the population. wi
n We had huwever, given us, .a splendid pi
it affair, at which all the aristocracy of the sti
h place attended, and where I had an op- VIO
g portunity of seeing the beauty of the 4
g town, that would have taken any one by
ir surprise. The ladies were tastefully dres- Viol
i. sed, but rather too much ornamented with
,f jewels; most of them beautiful while the
i. large dark eye rolled with captivating 11
beauty. Hl,n
The Cumanches about two hundred and
L. fifty strong came in sight of the town a _.
r> few days before our arrival. They visi- ,ar
a ted a military post occupied by a small j"us
y detachment of our troops about six miles
below, and they appeared fully prepared
for war, each man with his shield, strung ',l
[a bow, quiver full of arrows. They howe- ~
r_ ver made no demonstration to that effect, [J_j
their object being to obtain their prisoners a Qai
in our hands. From their repeated per- tativc
;> fitly the government has determined that
they shall never be met again, only as &
foes. "
There is not much domestic news, nor
,1' any of importance. The Indians still
t. keep up their predatory warfare, but their *'t
incursions are not so frequent. Wc have
also frequent rumors from the Rio Grande
of the movements of the parties conten- j10UI
^ i ding for power. An extra session of Con- .a e
gress is spoken of, but I am inclined to ieJ
think it will not take place. I do not 1
know what will be the consequence if our
