War, war to -the kuife; he enthrall'd

Was the echo that waked in the land
But it was not his voice that prompted the
cry,
Nor his madness that kindled the brand;
He raised not his orm, he defied not his
foes,
While a leaf of ihe olive remained;
Till goaded with insult, his spirit arose
Like a long baited lion unchainted,
He struck with firm courage the blow of
the brave,
But sighed over the carnage that spread ;
He indignantly trampled the yoke of the

Btwept for the thousands that bled.

walking backwards and forwards in astate
of anary excitement.
'Don't call harsh names, Mr. Single

from the mass of papers before him, and
smiling, in a luiet benevolent way, that
was peculiar to him.
- Every man shotld be known by his
'true name. Willianis is a scoudrel, and
so he ouglit to 'he clled!' respotinded the
-c;ienut with -increased warmth.
"'Did yoU ever do a reasoahie thing in
your life, wmhen you were angry?' asked
Mr.Trumnatn,whtde age and respectability

to his young friend, for whom he was. cr
