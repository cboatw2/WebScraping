The Richmond Enquirer in speaking
of the resignation of the Hon. John C.

States, says:
44 We deeply regret to lose the services
of Mr. Calhoun in the next Congress.?
He is one of the brightest luminaries,
struck out, as it were, from the firmament
of our public councils. His mind, how.
ever, will not be lost to his country?for
we understand that he is engaged in the
^composition of a work on the Principles of
Government?winch is destined, perhaps,
to toe a posthumous production?and upon
it Mr. C. means principally to rest the
monument of his fame. For the. present
session, no State will he so well represented
in the Senate of the Fnited States as
South Carolina, in the persons of Messrs.
Calhoun and McDjffie.
Or Yellow Fever and its Origin.
. .fo August last the Board of Health at
New Orleans addressed a letter to the
president of the Board of Health in New
York, asking lor such information as the
experience of New York would afford
Lcmching the origin, foreign or domestic,
of yellow fever, and the utility of quaran tine
laws to prevent its ravages.
The letter w as referred to a committee,
.rfmatsUng of a resident physician, health
officer, health commissioner. Mayor, and
iwo aldorrnen, whose answer we find in
.the American of Saturday.
The committee set out in reply by a
.statement of the considerations which induce
the belief that yellow fever is a disorder
sui generis, distinct from ordinary
bilious and intermittent fevers. They
then enumerate briefly the grounds on
which foreign origin is contended for by
some and domcstie by others, with an ev.
ident leaning to the former opinion?and
conclude by an unqualified expression of
iheir belief that the non-appearance of the
disease in New York since 18*22 is mainly
if not wholly owing to the increased
rigidity wiih which, since that time, our
quarantine regulations have been enforced.?N.

Rail Road Accident.?Last night,
about 10 o'clock, as tiie train from LinJ.
adelprna was approaching Newark, one of
the rails broke, although an 11 rail, after
the locomotive had passed ; the end toward
the passenger cars was thrown up,
caught the lower frame of the first one,
and literally tore it in fragments, launching
the body with the passengers in it on
to the road, without the slightest hurt to
any of them. The rails and sleepers
were torn up for two or three hundred
feet. A train from Newark took off the
passengers, and this morning ttie wreck
is all cleared away, and the road repaired
and in use again.?N. Y American.
