THEiROMANCE OF NAVAL
III STORY.
Among the romantic exploits of nut
hardy mariners, during the war of Inde
penpence, there are few which can com
pare with the capture ol'the General Monk,
bv the Ilyder Ally, under the command
of Captain Barney.?This took place in
the waters of the Delaware, and was the
occasion of great exultation in our city.?
The account of the affair, which we quote,
is from the life of Commodore Barney, edited
by Mary Barney, published in 1S32,a
book, by the way, which is written with
great vivacity and dramatic power, and
.I...
iii wi it iiii' Jim, at uraoi iui iiir
American reader, than a whole library of
trashy novels. It has all the vividness,
and much of the racy originality which delight
the erudite readers of Froissart, Monstrelet
a nil the other chroniclers of the
olden time. But we must hasten to the
story.
"About the close of the revolutionary
war, the Delaware Bay and tiver were infested
by numerous 'refugee barges and
privateers, which were committing the
most extensive depreciations, not oniy upori
the commerce of Philadelphia, but upon
the peaceablo inhabitants, along' the
shores -of every accessible stream, that
emptied into these waters. In order to
drive off these plunderers, who were protected
by the presence of several at his
Majesty's .ships, and to offer that assistance
to their distressed citizens, which
was not in the power of the general government
to afford, the state ofPennsyl.\ania '
had determined to fit out, at its own ex-'
perse, a number of armed vessels, the
operations of -which were to be confined j
within the great thoroughfare to their
capita]. Five days after, Lieutenant Bar-,
ney's arrival at Philadelphia, he was honored
with the offer .of the command of one
of the vessels to be equipped, a small ship,
mounting 10 six-pounders, and carrying
110 men, called the , 'Ilvder Ally.' lie
did up I, as may be supposed, hesitate one
moment to accept the command, and to
place himself at the. disposal of the slate
authorities, from whom he had received
many acts of kindness. He entered iin
mediately upon the duties of the command.
The ship was yet to be equipped
and manned, but with active superintendence
and willing hands this is au affair
which may soon he despatched. On the
Btli of Apsil, I7S2 only eighteen davs after
the happy- re-union with his family, and
tliiileen afi<-r he t ok command, the !lyder
Ally was ready to proceed on her destined
service. The instructions under
which Capt. Barney acted, were very plain
and riicumseribi'd; he was to convey a
fleet of merchantmen to the capes, but on
no account t<> proceed to. sea, it being the
intention of the state, simply to protect its
own people, within its own waters, and
chief! 7 from the annoyance of the 'refugee
boats.' The convoy dropped down to
Cape May Road; and while lying there,
waiting for a fair wind to lake them to sea,
n >4
two ships and a brig were, discovered
standing for them. Cjpt. Barney, perceiving
them to be a part of the enemy's
force, made the signals to his convoy to
get under way immediately and return up
j|. - I. . -1 I I .1 l
me oay; orders wmcii uiey were noi slow
in obeying, with the exception of one ship,
which was armed; and her commander
very gallantly determined to abide the issue.
lie hailed Captain Barney, therefore,
and made known his intention, in
case of an engagement, Ho stick by him??
a promise, by the way, which we might as
well say at once, he prevented himself
from redeeming, by running his ship
aground on the Cape May shore, in his eagerness
to get to sea as soon as the action
commenced, in this situation, his crew
jumped ashore from the end of the jibboom,
and made their escape, and the ship
fell into the enemy's hands.
"Captain Barney kept astern of his convoy,
watching the motions of the enemy,
with allihe eagerness and anxiety natural
to so important a trust, lie saw that the
brig at one of the ships were, following
him into the Cape May channel, while the
other ship, (a frigate) was manteiivcring
to run ahead by the other channel, and
thus cut off the other progress of the convoy
up the hay. His only hope for the
safely of his convoy wi s, that the enemy"
would first direct their attention to him,
and that by a desperate resistance, I e
might employ them long enough to allow ,
time for his charge to get beyond their
pursuit. For this purpose he would wiI- ;
liiigly have engaged t e .vhole of the ene- ^
mv's form at mice, imii if lie bad a tlinn !
saixl lives, would have rated them all us
nothing, if by their sacrifice he could gain
for his convoy the advantage of one hour's
start. The biijr was the first to come up
with him, hut it soon became evidu t that it
was not her design to risk an engagement
alone; she gave him a broad side as she
came up, and passed on. Captain Barney
did not return the fire, determined to reserve
his strength for the ship, which was
coming up rapidly. She approached within
pistol shut without firing, probably under
the impression that her unequal foe
would not venture to make battle; at this
moment, however, the llyder-Ally opened

I her purls and gave a well directed broad.
I side, which spoke her determination in a
language not to be misunderstood. The
enemy closed upon Iter immediately, and
r showed a disposition to board; at this criti.
cal juncture Captain Barney had the cooj.
nessanil presence of mind to conceive and
execute on the instant, a ruse dc guerre,
to which he was unquestionably indebted
for the brilliant victory that bo speedily
followed; he gave orders to the man at the
helm, to interpret the next command he
should give him aloud a reverse, or in his
own words to the spaman, 'by the -rule of
contraryAt the moment that the enemy
was ranging alongside of him, a posi

advantage of his great superiority of
slrengili, Captain Barney railed out, hi a
voice intended to reach the adverse ship,
"Hard apart your helm?do you want him
to run aboard of us?' The ready wittled
seaman understood his cue, and clapped
his helm hard a-?tarboard, by which admirable
manoeuvre the enemy's jibboom
caught in the fore ringing of the Hydcr
Ally, and there remained entangled during
the short but glorious action that ensued.!
The Hyder Ally, thus gained a raking po-!
siuon, of which she availed herself to its
utmost benefit; rapidity, well-directed aim,

broadsides were fired in twenty six minutes, \
and scarcely a shot missed its effect; enter- j
ing in at the starboard bow, and making'

all did their appointed duly! Such energy [
of action could long be withstood; and in-l
less th.'iii half an hour from 'the firing of !
the first broadside, the British fhg waved 1
its proud folds no longer to the brezo.? '
There was no time for ceremony on board !
the Hvdcr-Ally; the frigate was but a little ^
way astern, and coming rapidly iip. ,Cap-i'
lain Barney did not even ask what ship it '
was that had thus acknowledged him mas- 1
ter; but sending his first lieutenant and
thirty-five men on board, he ordered her
to make all sail and push up the bay, after 1
the convoy, while he himself covered the J
rear. The brig seeing that the ship hail .
struck, and that the victor was standing
up the channel towards her, ran herself 1
aground to avoid capture. It would be
ridiculous to assert that Captain Barney,
was desirous of a brush with the fri/'ate.
hut he maintained the 'even tenor of his :
wa v,' fir in the rear of his prize, and the <
still more distant convoy, determined not
to let her pass to the pursuit of either with
out, at least, attempting to delay her for a !
few minutes. 'I'lie frigate continued the,
chase for a considerable distance up the
hay, hut at length towards evening,- gave
it up and dropped her anchor, making a
signal, as she did so, to the prize ship,
which she did not course of suspect to be
under other orders; no doubt believing
that, having taken the American, she was
now working her will among the defenceless
convoy!
"It was not until after the frigate abandoned
the chnsc and came to an anchor,!
that Captain Barney permitted himself to
gratify the curiosity, which it was but natural
he should feel, us to the name,
character, and force of his prize. He
now spoke her for this purpose; and we
may imagine the exuberance of delight and
gratified pride, with which he ascertained
her to be His Majesty's ship, the General
Monk, mounting 20 nive pounders, and
carrying one hundred and thirty-six men,
under the command of Captain Rodgers
of the Royal Navy! nearly double his
own force in metal and nearly one-fourth.
superior in number of men! It was one
of the most brilliant achievements ever
recorded in the annals of naval warfare,
and a victory of which he might well be
proud, But no man ever bore such honors
more meekly than Captain Barney;
he rejoiced in his success, but it was more
because it had insured the safety of the
valuable Heel entrusted to his convoy, than
lx-cause of any anticipation that it would
encircle his own brow with a never dying
wreath of glory. Prompted by that everready
humanity, w hich so honorably eha.acterized
his treatment of a "couqueren
foe, though he had experienced so linle
of it in his own person, he inquired immediately
into the sufferings of the crew,
and heard with regret, that the General
Monk had lost 20 men, killed, and had
33 wounded. Among the former wee
the first lieutenant, purser, surgeon, bomswain
and gunner; among the latter were
Captain Rodgers himself, and every ollicer
on board except one midshipman.?
The llyder-Ally had Jiiur men killed and
eleven wounded?a comparative disparity ;
of loss even greater than the inverse dis- i
parity of force. * 1

Were counted exactly three hundred and
sixty-Jive shot holes! It was looked upon
as so great a curiosity, that oiTfe of the
principal sail-makers of Philadelphia afterwards
begged it of Captain Barney,
and made a considerable sum by exhibiting
it in his sail loft.
k *?- V
"Many incident's occurred during the
lie;it of this rapid and vigorous action
which are well worthy of notice. Captain
Barney, in order thai he might the
belter see ail that was going on and regulate
his movements accordingly, remained
standing upon the binnacle during ilie
whole action, in the most exposed point
ol' Ins quarter deck, particularly to the
fireof the musketry IVom the enemy's loos.
On one occasion a hall.passed through his
hat, just grazing the crown of his head;
another tore off a part of the skirt Of his
coat; seeing himself thus the aim of t! e
small-arms, he called to Mr. Scull, li s
marine officer, (whose men were all Bucks
county riflemen . who had never before
been 0:1 board a ship.) and ordered hini.lo
direct his rire into the top from which he
was so much annoyed; the order, was
promptly executed, and with such good
aim that every shot brought down its man.
A few minutes after this one of these
brave fellows, who was much better acquainted
with the use of his rifle than with
the rules of subordination, called out to
Captain Barney, with a coolness of% tone
nil ft A> m I 11 U ri I V t\i murinrjp I V* u f /j t? J */
anything but intended disrespect:?'Captain!
do you sec that fellow: with tjie white
hatV and firing as he sp'ok- , Captain
Barney saw the pour felluw .with the'white
hat' make a spring at least thtee feet from
the deck, and fall to rise no more. 'Caplain!'
continued the n arksman, 'that's
the third fellow I've made hopV It is a
remarkable fact, highly- indicative of the
deliberate coolness of these Bucks County
men, that every maiKil the enemy who
was killed by the small arms, was found
to have been shot in the head or breast?
so true and deadly was their aim. While
Captain Barney continued standing on the
binnacle, he observed one of his officers,
with the cook'suxr in his hand, in the very
act of raising it to cleave the head of one
of his own men, who had deserted his gntt
and skulked behind the main-mast; at th's
instant a round shot from the enemy struck
the binnacle from under. Ins feet and he
fell upon the deck; the officer, seeing his
captain fall, nnd naturally supposing that
he was wounded, thtew down the axe and
ran to his assistance, but by the time he
reached tlio spot La pi. Barney had reco vered
his feel, unhurt, and the officer very
deliberately picked up the axe auain to
execute his purpose upon the head of the
coward: he found him now fighting as bold
and fearlessly as the bravest of the crew!
Joseph Bedford, a brother of Co plain Barney's
wife, was a volunteer in the Hydcr.Ally,
and behaved with great gallantry; lie
was stationed in the main top, and received
a severe would in the groin, the afleel
of which he ncver.enlirely recovered; but
it is worthy of remark, as an extraordinary
circumstance, that he did not feel his
wound, or know i hot he was hurt, until he
had descended From the lop, upon- deck,
after the action was o ver; he then fell, exhausted
from the loss of blood, and was
carried below.
"The action was so vigorously rapid
and short, and its result so little expected
on the part of the adversary, that he had
either not time, or not sufficient presence
of mind to think of destroying his book of
signals; an oversight of which Capt. Barney
availed himself; and it was probably
owing to this circumstance that the frigate
(the Quebec) so soon discontinued the
chase and anchored. Immediately after
the action, he ordered the British Hag to
be rehoisled on board the General Monk,
and his own to be hauled down on board
the Hvder Ally. The Quebec, therefore,
had good grounds for believing that Jus
Majesty's ship had been victorious.'
In a Sermon on the death of William
Henry Harrison, delivered by the llev.
Tn/wil. TP Pipree. the following incident
connected with our Revolutionary history
is mentioned, to illustrate how deep were
the pious sentiments of the patriot fathers
who signed the Declaration of independence:
"On the ovcr_ womorabl-o rirh Jutyr1776,
when tliat band of enlightened patriots
and sages, called the Continental
Congress, with sad hearts and dejected
countenances, were deliberating on the
Declaration of American linh pendence,
they reached a point pending these deliberations
when a 11 hearts were laint, and
all countenances de'ply sad, and it was
feared by mariv that the "decision would

of the nation being in evt n balances, the
slightest influence would hare thrown our
fate either way. We had reached the
point that was t<? decide our destiny for
weal or wo. At that solemn,?awful yet
gloriously eventful crisis, that patriot, sage
statesman, philosopher, and we trust,
Christian, Benjamin Franklin, rose in his
place and moved "that icr have prayer
The motion was carried without a dissenting
voire. Dr. John Withcrspoon, a
Scotch Picsbyierian'.clcrgynia i, who ivas
ii member of that Congress, was railed
upon 10 offer tip the prayer. While that
prayer was otiered un, American Indo-r
prudence was born. These noble men
rose from their bended knees, and signed
in solemn silence the Declaration that
sealed our Independence and made us a
free people." * ">* **

"we gi ve the following1 extract:
''Having detained the sloop SaUy, wl icl^

and was to have returnrd.there previous to
her sailing for the United States, I con.
ceived that this sloop would be a suitable

except five or;six to work her in. . They
ran along side of the ship, and boarded ber

Capt. Carmick and Lieut. -Amory landed
with the marines, up to their necks in water,
and spiked ull the cannon in the. fort,
before tlie commanding officer had time to ; \
