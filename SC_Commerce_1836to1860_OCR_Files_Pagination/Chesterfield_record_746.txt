which they have already granted, provided they :

"Mr. CAMPIIELI., of South Carolina, did
not rise for the purpose of discussing the exchequer
project, more tlmn once recommended hy the
President, and now reported upon unfavorably hy

to say that, in his opinion, it was hy no means the

if it* merits could he demonstrated, it would proha.
hly have hut lit?lc prospect of success in a Congross,
almost every member of which is pledged,
by Ins previous course, to some other proposition.
He had inertly risen with the intention (without
entering into the discussion at length) of indicating
to his constituents the course which he should
probably hereafter pursue in connexion with cub.
jects of this character.
Mr. C'., as his speeches sufficiently testified,
had been always favora.de to a separation of the
Government funds from the uses of banks ; but,
when that proposition. s ? correct in principle, had
been connected with another, requiring the public
dues to be collected exclusively in specie, he had
invariably voted against it?believing that such a
requirement was calculated to increase the pressure
on the commerce of the country, already almost
too great to be home.
Since that question, however, was last agitated
in Congress, a change has occurred. Hank circulation,
without any oppression on the part of the
Government, has gone on gradually decreasing.
| until, i:i many of the States, tlie circulation is reduccd
below the specie actually in their vaults.?
Under circumstances, Mr. I*. believed that
the separation Oi the Government funds from the
business of trade, eve., if connected with the re.
quircmcnt of specie, or Government credit -, ex lu
sivrly, i;t pavmcnt of I fit* public dues, wouKl now

for having been cle 'tod bv bis constituents with a
knowledge of bis previous eoorse, In- would scarce,
ly feci himself at liberty tod i so. Dut he wished
to indicate to them, bv the remarks In: had suh.
nii'.ted, that in the event of being returned to the
next Congress, lie would, unless a change occur,
red in our monetary ull'iirs, pro'oahly act with the
Democratic parly 0:1 this subject, as lie liad upon
most others.
Mr. CI ly bis hern in New Orleans for a lew

is treated there with extraordinary marks of re.

lie the most magnificent ever made in that city.
Committees from .Mobile and Augusta have invited
him to visit these cities before bis return
home, and lie is expected to do so. A public
meeting was also held in Charleston 0:1 the 17th
instant, for the purpose of manifesting their re.
sprct for bis character and puhlic services, and inviting
him to visit that city also. The lion.

Tt IF. Clieraw Academical Society is now in Mq,

has expended, fur loin, building-', and repairs, j)aj
about ?t.")tl()t); besides largo hiiiiis o| money ut I \y
making up to teachers from time to tune do- j ()f .
ticicnces in their salaries, atising from inatle | ?j
quale receipts for tuition. 'I'liotigli the . ,jon
Society lias heretofore received considerable j nir
aid from citizen* and others not members ; yet ^
the principal burden and the w hole responsi. \y .
bdity (previous to last year) lias always rest- ?0 f
ed on those who trere. The Society now
consists of few in number ; and at a meeting ",lf1
ceitviuiod this day, it was resolved to sell the I'
Acad, inical Lots and lluildings for lite pur- j lV.o
pose of paying the above debt ; unless smite ' 1
measures are promptly adopted by the com. ! p,;0
munity to discharge the same. Most, perhaps j
all, the m?mbers of the Society are understood ^
to be willing to co operate with their fellow.* rnu
citi/.eiH in this matter; but they are not d:*>? i
posed to do it without their assistance. I ^
The Kith ilav of next month is lived (<>r
detcrming upon the sale ; utile**, before tliat |V
date, the people (with such arguments assatisly
creditors) put their veto upon it. j d '
