SiLK CULTURE,

KEEPING OF MULTICAULIS OVEB WINTER.
numbers of muliicaulis trees
trill bo taken up thin full and kept out of the I
ground uii winter, for purposes of sale, and I
by many, under an apprehension, that they
will be injured by the inclemencies of the
Benson, it is deemed proper to devote a por.
tion of the present number, to the best mode j
of preserving them. Let us be understood,
however ; if the trees are growing on high
dry situations, (the more stoney and grav.
city the better,) and the trees are not want-1
ed for any purpose tili the opening of spring,
the best and most certain nv'thod of preserving
?hpm, is to leave them where tkev
are. In such situati ns wo have never
known a tree, cr a limb, or even a bud, to I
bo injured by winter. This is our own I
practice invariably. We never ever even
lake off the cuttings we intend to plant in
the soring till we have go? the ground ready
fot theiif, tn March or April.* But where
early frrors, and late spells of warm weathcr
between thom, late planting, <5cc. have
caused a considerable quantity of unripened
wood at the extremities to remain at the fall
of the Lnf, all this' unripened woo I should i
!?*? nmt nfFht'form the s were cold approaches
?say immediately after the leaves have!
fallen.?and buried in the ground as follows: j
select the highest and the driest situation in
field or garden if possible on the north
side of 9 house, barn, or high board fence,
(but not nnder trees,) where the sun never
shines in winter. Lay the cu'tings on the
fop of the ground, side by side, near together
but not touching, cover the first layer
with loose fine earth one inch. Then
lay on another layer of cuttings, side by
side, as before, and then another layer ofj
earth, and so on Mi you have laid ail the
cuttings down, taking care to press the earth i
firmly. Then throw on earth, covering!
the who! * about one fool deep, and packing !
the surface firmly, and forming the top of j
* * *1 ?1 !%** if nf U '
tho pile into me s'?aj>c v?? iw.#. house,
that if may throw off iho water. If
you have one thousand branches you wish
to preserve, Jay down one hundred in each
layer, and thus you will have ten layers.
The earth which you use should bo taken
from a ditch which you w il dig around the
pile ; and this ditch will serve us n drain to
draw off the water from the pil" ofcu tings.
Cure must be taken that no inters:ices be
left among the cuttings, as the confined air
in them will cause mildew, and of course the
loss of the cuttings. The situation should
bo protected from the sun as much as possible,
that the pile may remain frozen all
winter, as it is the occasional freezing and
thawing that injures unripenod wood. It
should not bo exposed to the dripping from
the eaves of the house, or from trees, as ihnt
saturates die pile with water. This unri
pened wood, thu9 preserved, if taken from
tho pile in the spring and immediately
planted, without unnecessary exposure to
the a >, will grow and make as fine trees as j
tho best matured wood.
Where trees must neccens?>rdy be taken
* ~?1 />!!? r?f it?o crroiind dunni? w 11. J
vp anu acjit ?. ..? b o
ter, the bust mode of preserving tltem, is to |
bury their roots in the ground in an erect j
posi;ion, in some situation perfectly protec-1
ted from the sun. Where a large numb?r
fire to be protected, a long shed that will
shelter them from the sun, should be erected,
open at the sides and ends, that a free
passage may be afforded for the air. The
m< un lion should bo the highest and driest
ut command, and the more open to a northurn
exposure the better.
Once for nil, let it be said, that the morus
muliicaulis is never injured by cold, however
intense it may be ; that they are only in-;
juird in winter by the sudden application j
ofhent while in a frozen stcte ; and that the j
only pro'ectioo they require during winter,!
is to be protected from H?AT,,at all times.
Supposing that a shed, as*above mentioned,
has been erected for the purpose,
tlf& trees may be set as close ns jiossibie,
merely throwing a lililu earth between the
rocrs, and when ull are sot, the trees left
standing at if they had grown there. If
any part of the roots appear above ground,
they should be covered by the application of
a shotfcUull of earth. If the soil be of a
sandy ^Uality, it is' the bust. Clay soil
*
Farther Soatb it should be earlier, say when
the bads begin to swell, which in this neighborhood
it commonly in February.?Eo. Cm.
should be avoided, as it cannot be placed
about the roots whhout leaving cavities,
which w iil cause mildew.
Collars, open at the north and south
sides, will answer a good purpose, provid d
they are on high situations ; but if at tho
foot of hills, they will not do, unless on the
north side of the foil, as th<y nro apt to be
too damp, and thus in w irm spells of weather,
to engender mildew.
Tne next best plan for the preservation
of trees. is that laid down for the preservetion
of unripe wood, at the beginning of
this paper. It is a very lalorious plan
whpre a largo number of trees are ;o be preserved,
but is worthy of ull the labour ro?
quired in the present state of things?where
the tree is so valuable.
When trees have been preserved by burying,
as in the case of unripe wood they are
in so delicate a condition in the spring as to
be incapable of bearing much exposure to
the dry atmosphere without injury, and.
therefore, should be planted as soon as possible
after being tuken our of the pile.
When tr< cs are preserved in close eel
lars,in sand, they are apt to become mildewed,
and of course killed. If they are
entirely buried insand in a close cellar, they
are often preserved in perfect condition,
but are liable to grow, from the warmth of
the cellar, and thu3 become injured. In
such cases the only remedy is to ventilate
ihc cellar by opening windows on the i orth
orc?:,!h sides, and keening ice in there?. |
lr, and thus cooling it. Take it for granted,
that you cannot hurt tin trees by cold
in any situation where the sun cannot shine
on them.
B ; careful of the roo's of the trees, when
taken up from the ground where they grow,
the roots should no: be expose to the sun,
n'?r to frcs* i t th" open ar. For ift'ie root
be injured by drying or by frost, the whole
tree may be lost. The root is the most
delicate part of the tree, and when that is
injured, the whole tree is almost certain to
be lost. If the root be frozen, and suddenly
exposed to the sun. the tree is inevitably
destroyed. We have seen trees that presented
a fine healthy appearance, thoy looked
plump, the buds sound; but on examining
the roo's we found tbem shrivelled, or mildewed,
in spots, the bark ro ten and easily
removed These would generally be taken
for good trees for cuttings, and we have
seen many such sol J for propagation. But
on cutting up those trees into cuuings there
will npp-'ar a dark coloured ring around the
wood under the bark, showing that lias decay
has commenced. Toe buds of ;he
cuttings will generally gro.v an nch or two.
but then, not being cap ihleofmaking roo'f.
;h'y wither end die. We have soon mil.
lions of cuttings fail from tnis cause, and in
this way the past season. The cause of
the injury wa9, probably, the freezing of
the roots and their exposure to sun or air
while so frozen ; or the roots may have become
shrivelled and dry from exposure, and
thus lost their vital cirru! t on.
The mtilticauhis may be k *pt in peifi'Ct
condition from the fail of the leul in tae fall,
till late planting lime in the spring ; may b<transported
from country to country, and
passed from hand to hand with proper care.
From the time it ceus* 8 growing in the fall,
till the proper season for its commencing
growth again in the spring, it may witn
proper attention be used as an article of
merchandise, with perfect safety. But it
cannot stand every thing.* The roots
must never be allowed to become dry, nor
will it do to keep tiiein moist by the application
of water. They must be able to take
up from the surrounding medium, whether
thai be earth, moss, or sand, that peculiar
moisture, (or water in an extremely minute
division of its panicles,) ad ?p:ed to the extremely
small absorbent vessel of its routs.
You will drown n tn-e by a long combined
immersion in water, as well as an animal ;
whereas, if the roots had been surrounded
by moist earth, or moss, it could have imbibed
a sufficient d gree of mois'ure to preserve
i'. Keep the roots from becoming
dry by exposure to the air, light, or sun, and
from being froz *n ; or, if frozen, from exposure
to the uir, light, or sunshine, and you
may rely upon the trees bring preserved.
Purchasers op trees are cautioned
against receiving, either in the fab, winter,
or spring, any tree as sound, the bark of
which has become shrivelled. It is as much
a sign of death in vegetal ion, hs is the recession
of the blood from the surface of animals
a sign of death in them. It is true that
the multicauiis is se tenacious of life that
we can sometimes resuscitate a tree after
the hark has become shrivelled and dry ;
but it is difficult, and not often accomplish,
el. At all even', purchasersahoul i uev?t
receive trees in that condition. We attri.
bute most of the failures of cuttings the past
season, to the bad condition of the cuttings
planted. We saw many trees sold, and
planted too, the bark of which hud become
perfectly shrivelled and dry, and were greatly
surprised at the singular delusion of both
seller and bujer. Let purchasers also examine
the boots ofthe trees they purchase.
If they are shrivelled and very dry, or if the
bark be rotten to any extent, reject them ;
for, though the tops be plump and fresh, the
injury to the roots will have extended to the
whole top under the b rk, though it cannot
!>es'*en. As above remarked, on curing
the body of the tree, a dark colour will |be
observed around the surface of the wood
under the bark, and the cuttings will not
make roots. g. b b.

We lea-n from a gentleman in this city,
who is deeply interested in the silk cubure,
that a Convention to promote the cultiva.
tion and manufacture of silk in the United
States is to be held in this city on the 10 h
of Deoember, next at which it is expected
that there will be an attendance of delegates
from every Congressional district in the Un.
ion, as well as from the Territories and the
District ofColumbia. This will be the most
important as well as :ho mqst numerous assembly
ever known in this country?silk
culture being destined to become one of the

It has b^on suggested that the distant

members of this Convention, as tiiey will ' c
necessarily be in Washington at ihe time, r
andean then attend tho sitting of the Con- i
vention without prejudice to as public busi? t
ness. ?
Arrangements are being made to accom- \
odato as many as 1,000 delegates, and for
the exhibition of the many specimens of Am- t
erican mauufactured silk to be brought in I
competition for the very valuable prizes so i
generously offered by the American Silk c
Society. t
It is desirable that the various silk com- i
panies in ?he country immediately appoint t
their delegates, and announce their names, ?
in the agricultural or siik papers, and for- I
ward a copy of the paper to tho Society at
Washington, so that a correct lis' of the tie- 1
legates may be made in anticipation ofthe r

in tho country favorable to silk culture J
should publish this or some similar notice

that an umple quantity be preserved, in orI

8USPENST0N OP SPEC IB PAYMENTS.
New York, Oct.
There was gre ?t exci emcntin Wall sireef
in Wednesday, in consequence of an snlouncement
of the U. S. Bank of Pennsylrania
would no longer he paid at their counor.
Post-notes to the amount or40 or
>0,000 dollars were due on that day, and
vere protested for non payment. On
Thursday morning intelligence was receiv.
d from PhiladHphi ? that the Bank of the
J. States, and nearly all the other bank9
n that city, and in Baltimore, had suspen.
led specie payments. It is supposed that
he banks generally in the Middle and South?rn
States will follow this example ; but that
hose of New York, <ew England, and
some of the Western States will continue
0 fulfil their promises.
The best account and explanation we
iave been oble to find of this mortifying
novemcnt, are contained n the following
:.\;rucU from Philadelphia letters and p t
jers.
A letter dated Philadelphia, Wednesday,
Dot. 9 h s iys; 4,Our B inks have this day
wspend? d specie payments. Tim drain
jpon them for a few weeks past has been
mormous, and nothing is coming in from
lie West. A meeting was held yesterday
jpon the subject, at which five, including
United States and Girard, voted for a suspension,
and nine against it* This morn,
ing the U. States notified others that they
nad determined to suspend, and of course
[he ot ters, who had opposed it, were then
forced imo it. They pay for the present
their five dollar bills. The Baltimore Banks,
1 learn, have determined to do the same
thing to day.
The Farmers' Bank at Reading, in this
State stopped payment yesterday.
S ocks advanced somewhat to-dav;
Vicksburg wont up to 38; Kentucky to 75;
U- S. Bank to 101. The Bank of Pennsylvania
extended tier discount line. Now
they have stopped, they must ail do the
same.
The (Philadelphia) National Gazette ol
Wednesday evening says:
"A combination of adverse circumstances
has reluctanily compelled the Banks ol
this city to resort to a temporary suspension
of specie payments. The failure of thu
harvest in England last your, oaus -d a demand
upon the Bank of England f?r more
t >an six millions of pounds sterling, abou
thirty million of dollars, wide i was drawn
and silver from i:s vaults and exported to
the continent to pay for grain.
This wi hJrawal of so large an amount ol
specie, produced at once a depression in
the value of cotton and other American produce,
and of course lessened our means in
England of paying for the lar ?o amount of
importations of foreign merchandize.
There has therefore been a continu"d
drain upon our Banks for specie to ship to
Europe to supply this deficiency* * Nothing
can be more honorable to the character of
our merchants, than the sacrifices they
have made to support their credit both at
home and abroad, lu this honorable strugglo
to maintain trivuJalQ the OQWnVTCial
character of our country, thv>y have received
every support which was in the powtr
of the Bank* 10 render ih< m. There is
However a point in human tiffiirs, when
Hfpr servution is the first law of nature.
That period is now arrived ; every effort
lias been made by our Banks to sfem the
orrent, hut in vain.
In support of this declaration it is only
necessary to siute, hat since the late resnm.
ition of specie payments, the Bank of the
Uni ed States hus paid out in specie up.
wards of twenty millions of dollars. In adJl.itm
to till*, iliu Lbiok lmm made great hocntices
to support lite cause of internal imrovements,
not only in Pennsy vmia but
Is*; w lie re,
Ol the ability of our Banks to meet all
heir engagements, no one can doubt. The
>afoty of a Bank does not consist in the
unount of specie idle in its vaults, but in
he ample security which it holds of its debt,
jrs. All that the Banks require, is, tune
o collect the debts due to them, to enable
hem to resume specie payments."
The Philadelphia Gazette of the same
lale says :
The affair is not one of choice, by the
Banks, bur?a mvessity not arising out of
. lack of power to continue specie pay.
nents, but of self preservation, under the
orm of keeping the specie from being
irained out oi 'he country.
This necessity has its chief c ?uso in the
'evulsion of the opium trade wish the C'bin*
ssf, a trade of, say fifty millions! The inurument
of this trade is known to be opiam.
Tins drug can no longer be employed
is an article of'exchange with the people.
Specie, therefore must take the place of it.
I' m Bank of England fairly reeled under
ihese liduigs from China?and was forced
to make a loan of the Bank of France, and
into the issue of two pound notes. The balance
i?f trade being against us demands
came over here for specie, and every packet
ship went out carrying uwuy from a half 10
million of dollars.
This was the great cause of the late striclure
in our Banks' discounts?he Binks
ould not discount paper, because their is*
sues came back upon them directly, for spe.
cic. Tue merchants were bleeding at
every pore. Trade and commerce wore
literally stopped. To aid as, far as possi.
ble the Banks, (or some of (Item) gave their
credit to the merchants under tho form ol
Fust-notes, payable four, or six, or eight
months ahead, hoping by tho time they arrived
at maturity thut tho pressure might beconic
relaxed. But this d;fi not afford tho
relief. The merchants, manufacturers find
mechanics, were yet suffering. This suffering
was not confined to this city. New
York felt it under all its forms of severity,
?as indeed did all our cities, and .he whole
country.
What, uuder such circumstances was tc
be done ? The Banks are just as good
and better, and more solid under a sea sot
of suspension, as under its opposite. The
obligation to pay out specie, to be taker
out of" the country, no longer existing theii
sp .cie remaining secure in their vaults, anc
| the cause that forced them to suspend d:sI
counting, bring removed, a relief cun now
be extendi 10 a suffering people, by relax.,
ing their o*ders for curtails, as well as by
suitable aids through discounts.
But besides the foreign demands for spe.
cie, the recent fires in New York and in
this city have made a call for the relief of the,
sufferers, under all their terms, for at least
one miiiion and a half of dollars. This is
j an addition to the previous pressure. The
j calamity required to be met?but the Banks
j could not meet this additional demand, except
at the loss of just that much of specie
to the country.
There is great relief at the bottom of this
suspension. Let the people regard it in its
irun light, and it will be every where applau*
dud.
Tne means required for rebuilding our
burnt districts, both here and in New York,
can now be had?and this will be to set
thousands of mechanics and working men
to work, who must otherwise have remained
idle."
The question will naturally be asked,
What effjet will the suspension in Phi adphia
have upon the banks in this city and
State and in New England ? There is o
difference in op'nions on this point. A
correspondent of the Journal ol Commerce
says :
** The natural and necessary effect will i
be relief to all othor places, and especially
to Now York, whence Philadelphia has takken
large sums for export and otherwise by
? 'l? "f P?ct Vnlp<. wliir-h n.iwt nnw
i t IU O'UVrf VI V*l? AlVlvwy ff B0Vr,
ceas?.
44 The effect his been to cornel the
Banks of New York to contract their engagements
and place themselves in a position
of positive safely, and tlietr deposites
und circulation are so reduced that with
about four million dollars in specie they are
beyond the reach of any contingency.
44 The export demand for specie has been
more for the wnnts of the Bank than *or the
regulur trade, and as our crops ore near at
hand, anu the amount due abroad small, we
look fora gradual amelioration in the mon^y
market, and a feeling of increased confidence
and security."
In its notice of tho suspensions by tho
Philadelphia Banks, the Philadelphia Sentinel,
an Admiuis:ration paper, makes the
followiug remarks :
44 The opinion has been gaining ground
for some weeks past, that it was expedient
10 resort to this measure, in order to prevent
ex emive failures on iho part of our mer.
chao s and trudurs, which would uliimately
prove disastrous to the community as well
as to the banks. Experience seems to
have shown the correctness of the opinion
entertained by the directors ofseverul of our
bunks, ti.Ht the resump ion of specie payments
was premature, and that tlie countrywas
not prepared for it. The consequence
has been another suspension in Philadelphia,
winch wiil probably be followed by a!! tin*
bunks in the Uni n." 44 The situation of
h se corporations is truly emburrasng.
They had co course left but to ruin many
of their customers, and oppress the wholu
mercantile community, or suspend specie
payments and throw themselves on the mercy
ot the Legislature. They have chosen
the latter alternative, and if they act in the
sp.rit of liberality they may rest satisfied that
while the representatives of the People will
assuredly embrace the opportunity now pres*
ntcd radically to reform the bunking system,
and correct existing ubuses, they will
not wantonly do any thing to injure fair and
well-conducted institutions-"

To which Mr. Clay returned the following
reply t
Ashland. Sept. 23,1889.
Gextlkneiv : In acknowledging the receipt
of :h?? note which you did me the honor
to address to me the 2lst inst. transmitting
a copy of the proceedings of a large meeting
of my fellow-cit zcns of Tennessee, assembled
at Nashville on the 9ih instant,
tendering the hospitalities of that city, and
inviting me to visit Tennessee this Fall, 1
assure you, with the most perfect truth and
sincerity, that I have never received a aimi.
lar compliment with more heartfelt satisfaction.
Considering the place whence this
gratifying testimony proceeds, the high char*
acter of those who have concurred in rendering
it, and the distinguished manner in
wh;ch it ha9 been borne 10 me by personal
and political friends, it demands the expression
of my profound and great ful acknowledgments.
It occasions me pninfui *md inexpressible
regret not to be able ?t once and
without hesitation to accept an invitation
which has coine to me under such flattering
and friendly auspices. But I have just ter
minated a long and arduous journey, nnd
my health is not good, as you must yourselves
have perceived. My private affairs,
too, and the preparations for another jour,
ney which I must shortly undertake to
Washington, require the constant application
of all my at.eniion during the intermediate
time. Under these circumstances, I
cannot venture to make a positive engage,
mem to visit Tennessee the present Autmn.
Ail, upon that subject, that I dare promise
is, that if, contrary to my expectations, I
should be able to make the necessary arrangements
for my journey to Wosington,
and I should find my health sufficiently ree>tahlislied,
I u ill, with the greatest pleasure,
visit Tuonessee prior to the approaeiiiog
session of Congress. But, if i should not
be able to do so, I will certainly, if my life
and health are spared, after my return from
Congress, avail myaclf of that opportunity
of making your State a visit.
1 request, gentlemen, that you will convey
:o my fellow-citizens of Tennessee
whom you represent, my deep sense of the
kind expression will) which they have been
pleased to honor me. Nowhere, during a
long public career, huve i been more misL
u.ideis ood or misrepresented than in your
Stote. From no St ate therefore could such
iMBtiiiig language come to me with more
sincere satisfaction, i am truly thankful
for being permitted to live down the culumnies
of which there and elsewln-re 1 have
been iho object. And it should be encouraging
and consoling to public men, who
strive honesily and faithfully to serve their
country, that if a wrong verdict is sometimes
precipe ately rcnderred with erroneous
views, and under the operation of passion
or prejudice justice is finally administered
with absolute certainty.
1 hope, gentlemen, that you will assist
me in makirg acceptable the reasons which
constrain me to torcgo the pleasure of an
immediate acceptance of the invitation
which you have had the goadoess to deliver.
And 1 cannot conclude without tendering
to you, collectively and individually, my
respectful thanks and my great obligations
lor the kind and friendly manner in r Inch
you have executed a commission involving
necessarily much personal inconvenience.
I add, also, assurance s of the cordial esteem
and regard with which I am,
Your friend and obedient servant,
H. CLAY.

time that the house of Hottingeur had come
to so extraordinary a determination as to
refuse the bills of an establishment from
which they have derived so very beneficial
an interest during an agency of twenty
