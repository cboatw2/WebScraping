EDGEFIELD.C. 11.
TauRSDAY, F.BRUARY 27. 1840.
A change having taken place, in the de
parture of the horse mail from this place,
our next number will not he published un
til the 7th of March next, which will be
on Saturday week. Our' paper will here
after he issued regularly, every Saturday.
We have made this change in our day
of publication, for the benefit of many of
our subscribers, who will thereby, receive
their papers at an earlier time, than they
do at present.
To CoRREsPONDENTs.-We would re
commend to our correspondents. the ob
servance of the following rules :
Write your communications in a plain
legible hand. Carefully puctuate every
sentence, and be particular in spelling
every word correctly.
Do not write on more than one side of
.a leaf of paper, in order that your article
may be divided out to two or more coin
positors, if necessary.
The comnuunications of all. who do not
observe the two first of these rules. will be
considered OUT OF ORDER. and will be
laid en the table, perhaps, not to be called
up again.
We will continue the publication of the
acts passed at the last session of the Legis
lature, when we receive a copy of them.
. The Charleston Courier, in a recent ar
tiele. complains that Gen. McDumie in his
eulogy on Gen. Hayne, spoke too much,
and too strongly in favor of the doctrineof
Nullification, as a large tumber of those
who had assembled to do honor to the il
lustrious deceased, were Union men, and
of course, opposed to Nullification. The
'iercury thinks that the orator did not
speak too strongly on this subject. We
refer our readers to the extract from this
paper, which we publish. When the eu
logy is published, the public can decide.
The present number terminates the con
inexion of the subscriber, with the "Edge
field Advertiser." Ill healh,under which
ihe has labored for some tinte past, is the
principle cause which induces him to take
this step. lie hates formal leave-iaking,
and is not disposed to use many words on
parting with his readers. He will not,
like some editors. boast of his great devo
tion to State Rights,Democracy, his untir
ing zeal in their support. and of his un
ceasing efforts in the cause of every thing,
that is good and noble. It is sufficient to
say, that he has endeavored to do his duty
towards his readers.
le would have been delighted to have
given the Advertiser, a more literary cast,
had circumstances permitted. But in ihis
utilitarian and political age, and in thic,
his beloved State. Belles-Lettres are at a
discount. The terminitation of the South
ern Review, and the Sotuthern Literary
Journal, Periodicals which would have
beeni the pride and ornament of tay coun
try. .bear sad attesmatioun to the truth of
this remark. To the amass of readers in
this hust ling generation, disguisitions upon
cotton bags, or partisan remarks upon the
ptretenlsion~s of candidates for the high offi
ces of the General,and State Governmets,
are of more interest, thant the linest essays
by our native writers, or the choicest ex
tracts from Europeani authors. Suo well
contvined are many of our men of talent,
of the truth of this, that they spend their
lives in writing andl speaking about mat
ters, which only temid to inicrease the mere
twealth of the community.
W1ho has not smiled ots reading the elab
orate essays of some of the ablest writers
of the day, uipon the prce of cotton. thec
building of Rail Roads, andl other thaing;
of the like perishable nature? It is certain,
that the intellectual energies of nmatny of
our great man have been employed on
these matters which are comparatively
low, to the exclusion of nohler purstits.
This is not the age of poetry or romance.
truly! These are the days of dollars andc
cents. Men are now, very much like those
described by Horace, in his age.
At bona pars hominuns decepta cupidine
falso,
Nil satis est, in quit ; quia tanti quantum
habeas sis.
But why write a homily? The subscri
ber promised to be brief. To his editorial
brethren, lie has ever been courieous. H eo
has never inidulged in ill-feeling towards
those of either party, though lhe has never
concealed his political principles. in their
maintenance, he has been open, and de
cidled.
To the State Rights branch of theDemo
cratie party, hewould say.
Macfe virtuate esto.
Go on. Assert your doctrines boldly.
They are founded on truth, and must pre
vail.
-The Advertiser will still he publhi.hed by
the Proprietor, Mr. W1m. F. Duriso.
There will lie no change in its political
principles. The subscriber trusts thai it
will receive that support, which the exp'e
rience and long connexion of the Proprie
tor wvith the press. utnder wvhose control it
will be placed, will doubtless deserve.

THE NEXT GOVERNUR.
We recommend to our readers: a careful
perusal of all the articles, on this subject, which
appear in to-days paper. Three of them are
written, by gentlemen of great ability and dis
tiunction, and of decided influence in this sec
tion of the State. We hope that our readers
will not be deterred by its length, from reading
the very able communication, signed "The
Nullification Party," since it contains a clear,
candid, anad full explanation of the claims of
Col. Richardson, to the office of Governor.
By particularly recommending this article to
the attention of our readers, we do not design
instituting a comparison between it and the
others. They are all ably tcriulen. And we
recommend the one alluded to, simply because
it contains a thorough discussion of the subject.
We feel convinced that no one, who is open to
conviction-who will go for measures and not
for men-who will act frotm principle and not
from prejudice. can, after a careful perusal of
that article, doubt, we will not say the propri
ety. but the necessity of the Sub-Treasury party
supporting Col. Richardson. The necessity
of placing a Sub-Treasury Union man in the
Gubernatorial Chai-, and thus uniting, the
Sub-Treasury party in our State, and enabling
ourselves to sustain that great chaipion of our
principles, John C. Calhouti, and through
him, the meansres which lie advocates, and of
which our State ap proves. is made so manifest
in that article, that we deem it unnecessary to
say more, than to recommend to our renders, a
careful perusal of it.
Though we were fully convinced that the
opinions, of the people of " Edgefield." and tile
- Up Country," were not expressed by those,
who assunied to speak for them, we thuught it
maore becoming, to let them answer for them
selves. T11EY HAVE ANSWERED! And
we are gratified to find, that in advocating the
claitms of Coil. Richardson, we are but express
ing the sentiments, o. (his entire section of the
State. Those who could say nothing else, a
gainst the nomination of COL. I., by the Mer
cury. have accused its honest and able editor
ofattempting to force all public opinion. We
desired not to render ourselves obnoxious to
that charge, and therefore, though, approving
of the nomination, we simply expressed our
opinion, and declined further discussion. The
number and character of the communications,
however, which we, io-day publish. relieves us
fron all feeling of delicacy on this subect.
But, indeed, if h y did not, we would be um
willing, longer, to permit mere notions of pro
priety, to interfere with the serious discharge
of our ditty.

GENERAL BANKRUPT LAW.
Several of the leading organs or the
Whtig party in New York have recently
coime Out st ronigly ini favor of a general
flankrupt Lawv to he enaicted by Congress.
Other presses of the parry here anud thenre
have seconded lihe move, wvihh an- appa rent
disptosit ion to aphproplrialte the credit of thme
stWgestion to the pat.They aewl
come to it. W.e are sorry indeed that they
h ave not the enitire- merit of it to rhemselves.
It will be remnermbered that the propriety
of such a law was sugges~etedl by the Presi
detnt in his Mlessag.e to the muemtorable
extra sessiot nl of 137. ft was recieved
wvihrtearkedl dislike by the Whig party
generally, and by their great leader, Mir.
Clay, wahrl vehenment inidignaitions. It for
meal one of the mtost imtportant links in that
chain of dnesperatte msetsures by which lie
said the Admniistration~ designed to over
throw the baniks,. abolish paper money,
destroy caommerce, raise the deuce, and
sow the whle coumtry with salt that it
might grow no more grass or bull calves
forever. We reher to his speech with the
etnormioaus big title page-, hrokrng like a
Gourd or a roaid stool-a stem with, armost
extenisive cap ont the tolp.
PTerh'ips Gen. darrison tinks dif'erently,
and Mr. Clay being now put ont to grass,
it amatters not what lie tnighit when lie
was otn the course. But this only by the
way. Several journals -with whoma we
like to agree whent we catn have mnan:

authorities.
Fair the definitioni ofbankrutptcy. it must

w'hich is thte bcst rule ever established on
the s'ublect. and there cant be no shadow
of doubt that among the acts which must
be classed iu that definition, as amounting
to bankruptcy, will be a deliberate decla -
ration of any man or company, of an in
teiion not to pay their debts-in short,
that a suspension ofcash payment will be
set down as an act of bankruptcy.-And
ihe conspiracy ofseveral men or companies
so to deny payment, will, or ought to be
defined, fraudulent bankruptcy. The law
must embrace corporations as we! as in
dividuals, otherwise it would be a very
poor and partial thing' tending rather to
increase than mitigate the evils ofthe pre
sent conf'usion. It must embrace banks
and ierchants, and the administration of
it in all its mighty power over commerce
and currency mtst he entrusted to the of
ficers of the Federal Government. Does
any one believe that in periods of great
deraugenient in trade, when merchants
are falling like autumnal leaves, and banks
are taking universal relfuge in dishones
ty, the Federal Government would firmly
and honestly execute such a law, that they
would take into their possession the effects
of650 banks aid teii thousand traders,
drawing into the great garner of their
courts the whole complicated affairs of a
nation, and undertake t lie office of distribu
ting the vealthi ofi he world anew? But
the effect of:his sudden and forced settle
nent of the disordered business of a hun
dred cities at such a time as the revulsion
of 18:37, would, itseems to us he disastrous
in the extreme. It would be especially -o
as it wnuld involve the entire remodeliig
of tl.e currency at the same tlie. But we
only wished to pointout the extent of power
and of interference with the institutions
;il(n private husiness of the States, which
must necessarily lilow from the estab
lishnent ora general hankrupt law.
The ieasure is urged as a relief to insol
vent merchants, pi oviding for the final
adjustment of their affairs with every body
so that they may lie troubled with past
debts no more. Something might perhaps
be gained ini this respect, bit the present
tmode ofrelinquishiment on the part of cred
itors. is in general satisfactory, and in
nine cases out orien, frees all honest ner
chats from subsequent persecitioi-for
the dishonest, it is scarcely worth while
to legislatc any more inl 'heir favur.

THE 1LOOD HOUNDS.
Thitnking it quite prohable ilint the
newspapeis would soon nainily the blooi
hounds broughit from Ctba, into creatures
about the size of an eiephant, with teeth
like a shark's., and jaws longer thnn an
alli21ntor's, I galloped over to -1iagiolia
yesterday, anti passed the day with the
attiable animals.
. So various are these dogs,in color,shaipe,
size, anI age. that -it first sight they appear
like ain ordinipry ptck barking about a
planter's dwelling, but examtintion proves
them qiuite another thing. To describe a
dog so as to lie onderstood, is difficult. I
must therefore convey a general idea by
requesting you to imruagine a short-haired,
lack, red, yellow, briedlcdor spotted dog,
or any color that ever liedecked the spe
cies. 21 inches high, and 36 inches long,
(or thereabois) viith a head, breast, fore
head, and shoulders like a light- made nus
tiT, and snout somewhat elotigated, cars
erect like a grey-hotind, (mostly cropped
where they betid) and loins, croup-hauu
ches.and tnil, like a gray-houd,only thick
er set. This combitiation, you iay cont
c i 'e, produces an aniial of great nerve,
strength andt agility, and such to all ap
peararce. are these blood hounds.
They are thirty-four in number-5 or 6
old dogs, well trained-the remainder
are younger-some I should think not a
year old; one otf these, a lady blood110-hottnd,
wI lked about tlie % illace with toe as fa
tmil iatrly aiid lovingly as a spa niel; buit her
kindniess was inoperautve upoti the rest or
her clani, for sucht a set oif feroicious beasts
I tnever before sawv. That modertn Daniel,
Van Aiimhurgh, who goes among the lions,
would stand no chanice atmong them.
Whleni any older tiing approaches one of
the tlder dogs, his eyes lasht, lie roars wit h
ratge,. t twists like a serpetnt to escape
from his chaiin, the keepers have them ult
der' subjectiotn, but htave frequenitly to
mnaittain quiet order by inflicting heavy
blows with a cudgel, whtent the- dog lays
dow i with an tiir, which seems to say, "'I
will lie civil to taccomooatte you; but
d-tn your stick," fur they neither wince
or howl.
A few dlays sice, as an experiment, a
negroavas sent a mile into the wvoods to
climbih a trce, and in an. hour tifterwardls, a
dleg was pit, upoa the trta--he followedi
it directt, hr-ouigh til thre- winlings of the
btushes withlouit fan in tg. The1 only ques
tion is, will t hey follow the trtiil of an in
dian iIf they will, they will lie a great
acqluisitioin, to the cunttry, for as to fight
ing, I am satiafied they wol grapple
with any thing. Thle waynwo or thi ree of
ihetmvwould r'attle a dozen I idiants out of
a sernbh, er a bay-gnll,. woulhd be tntbody's
business. 1 cati only achr rhat I aim very
much pleased with the blood-hiomtwda, anid
would like no better fuu than taking a

Explo-ring Exrpeditio.-The New York
Jourtnal of Cortmmerce states that Mr. B.
U. Ctuttler, of Brrnoklyti, htas received a
letter from the Exploring Expedition, da
ted Matavai Bay, Island of'Otaheiie, Sept.
1st, 1539 ndptn-marked Woods' Hole,
Mass. 261b Jan. -1840. It is from Camden
lludson,ofthe U. S. ship- Peacock. He
speaks of Capt. Wilkes and the officers and
crews being on shore. Nothing said of
the mission vessel. The expedition, at
the date above ientinned, wns on its way
to the far south, being lst froim Callao
and (we-presutne) the Sandwich Islands.
From the tenor of the letter it is. itiferred
that tho health of the squadron was good.
The Rerenue-the Tariff Silk.-It was
stated recently, by Mr. Buchianan,ofPenn.,
in presenting to ihe Senate a petition fhr
duty on imported silk, as a matter beyond
doubt, "that before the close of the present
session of Congress, we should be com
pelled to raise additional revenue to meet
the necessary expentitures ofGoverment;"
and lie added, that upon no one article of
imports, could a duty be laid, with more
propriety, than upon silk, which is now
free.
It is manifest from this indication anti
olhers, that the Tariff' question will, anti
mist lie broached before the adjournment
of Congres, for io one duty can he touched
without bringing into discussion, the whole
question, Compromise act and all.-Alex
Gazette.
The debts (e to a newspaper establish

Landl Land!! Land!!!
5,00 Acres of Land at Sheriff's Sale.
'ILL be sold on the 1st Monday in March
next, at Edgefield, C. 11. S. C. by the
Sheriff of said District, to satisfy diveri Execu
tions, Mortgages. &c. Five Thousand acres o'
hInd, more oi less, lying on the waters of Big
Horse Creek, four Miles from Haiburg, and
within two miles of Savannaih River, and ex
tending fonr miles on the Rail Road, known as
Milton's Mills. On said place is an excellent
set of mills in good order. consisting-of'four run
of saivs. and one Grist Mill. The saws are ca
prnble of cutting from twelve to fifteen hundred
feet of luinbei each, per day. A never failing
stream of water, snicieent to propel ten saws
at all times. It is navigable for Petersbnrg
boats, to the M ills, and can easily he mande so for
nuch larger nes. There is sawing lumber
enough on the land to run the Mills 10 or 1,
years, allowing each saw to cut 1200 feet per
tIy, and has the great advantage of Hamburg,
Augusta and Savannah markets, all by water.
One hand will, in two days, make his raft, run
aInd deliver two thousand fet in Hamburg or
Augusta. and two hands will. in twelve days,
rall, run and deliver 40,000 feet in Savannah.
These Mills have also annually furnished large
bills ofiunber fir tie Chareston Rail Road,
which passes within 150 or 2100 yards of the
Mills. -
There are 150 acres smider cultivation. and
2000 more suitable for cultivation. There is
otn the place. one good well finished dwelling,
pleasantly situated, together with Kitchens,
Smoke louse, Store Houses, Stables, Black,
stnith, Wheelwrights. and other shops. Also,
12 or 15 other small dwellings, in the viciiity
of the Mills, suitable for small families, and
here, at no very distant day, (with the perois
sion uF the proprietor) will be erected numerous
summer seats, where tie busy inerchant of the
city may retire. after tie labors of the day, in
twenty-hive talinutes. to a pure attnosphere, free
from the fatal umiasma Inusqtuelocs and dust, and
refresh himselfaniong the niumerons springs of'
as puro water as ca bo found in tie United
States. Nor is there aiy placein the Southern
country better calcuhited fur an extensive mann
factoring establishment, there being no want of'
watern and for helhh unrivrlled.
Their is tineh Pine Timber in the vicinitv
adjoining this tract. which must be sawed at
these Mills. We will now suppose that the
four saws cut but 1,200,000 feet-aainunlly, anI
after deducting all expenses, you have hut four
dollars per thousand. You will then have
$4,800 per annum, or the sum of $48,000 in
tei years. Yon mny also employ one lenin
and three hands, Which will deliver in twelvo
nionths. fifteen hundred cords of lightwood on
the Rail Road, for which they pay $2 121 per
cord; which will make 3:U87,-5900 out, for
team and hands, leaves $2287,-or, with the
same hands and team, deliver on the bank of
the Savannah River. twelve imudred cords of
lightwoml, for which the Steamboat Company
pay $3 03 per cord-which will make $3,600,
$900 out, leaves $2.700-or, in ten years, $27,
000. You may also emplov three more teams,
and five hands, which will deliver in lamburg,
or Angusta, (as the Bridges are now free, both
for NWood and Lumber.) one thousand cords of
hard wood, which brings from S3 50 to $6 00
per cord, say $400. You will then have $4000.
Haitis and team, say $i.00-it will leave you
$2500 per ainunt or $25,000 in ten years.
Thus, you see, that in ton years. sccording to
the above calculations, (which no experienced
man will say are large,) you will take from thie
land, one anndred thousand dollars, and still
have yonr laud andi mills left.
It is estimated by good judges, acquainted
with the land. that it will average, at least, four
cords of litzht wood, and four ol hard wood,
per acre. And those best acqnated with the
rapid growth of hnrl wood, and the production
oflieht wood, from Ole bodies of falen Pines,
will'rendily perceivetlhat the above natmed teams
could never divest the land of wood. And
while it continues fashionable. to have good
fires in cold weather, and fir Steamboats and
Loconotives to birn wood, so long this land
utist remain valuable. The Rail Hoad Cotm
patny, by purchasing this place, may supply
this end of their road with sawed luinmer Rang
ing timbers al lightwood anad ihereby save
their thonsands annuallv. And let them and
other Capitalists, refleci, that five thousand a
cres oflanil in a body, with a Rail Road passing
through it, on which, is one of the finest
1ill streams in the United States, with a sn
perb (laim ail mills, all ini order, within a few
mile's of onie of the best Lutmber and Wootd
tmarkets in the Soitth, is not to be found every
year at Sheritih' Sale.
