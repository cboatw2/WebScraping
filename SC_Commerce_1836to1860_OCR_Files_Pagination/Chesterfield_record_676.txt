others not even your enemies. Rejoice 1
in the triumphs of justice, hut retain your
pity for the meanest sinner. Is lie not a
man, and still susceptible of reformation ?
Does not God bear with hiui; and should ;
not we ?
4. Envy not others their prosperity.? ;
This is the mmk of a Isttle mind. When !
we fail of the objects wo aim at, we
should rejoice at tho success of others.
5. Let your aims be high : this w ill excite
to effort.
ft. Be moderate in your expectations: J
this will prepare you for defeat.
7. Never despair. How often has the ;
* i p if -t k? i
J Hot struggle brought reuei. n iiutu ue ,
but one chance of success in a thousand, I
it is worth a thousand limes too much to I
be thrown away.
8. Consider how many are less favored
than you are. If yon cannot gam the
heights, be satisfied with a mediocrity, j
which is always the safest, less subject to :
changes, and of more equal temperature.
9. Bear yourself humbly in prosperity
A proud spirit is the product of native
meanness.
10. Maintain a thankful temper.?

admirable repert by Horace Mann, Esq.
Secretary of the Board of education of j
Massachusetts, the following striking ex- i
implication in introduced of the maxim j
that '-knowledge is power:"
"M. Redelet, in his work, vSu/r" Art r!e '
ftatir',1 gives the following account of an
experiment made to test the different
amounts of force which, under different
circumstances, were nec< ssarr to move a
block of squared granite, w eighing 1,050 i
lbs,
"In order to move this block along the ,
floor of a roughly chisstled quarry, it
iequircsa force equal to 753 lbs.
- . _ n ....
" rocraw me same moiiu u?i r ? m?n
of planks it required a force equal to 652
lbs.
''Placed on a platform of wood, and;
drawn over the floor, it required K06 lbs.
"By soaping the two surfaces of wood, |
the requisite force was reduced to 1?2 !
lb??.
"Placed on rollers of three inches di- j
ametcr, and a force iqual to 24 lbs. was !
sufficient.
"Substituting fx wooden for n stone
floor, and the requisite force was 26) lbs.
"With the same roller on a wooden !
platform, it required a force equal to 2*2
lbs. only."
"At this point, pjjvs Mr. Mann, the !
experiments of M. Rudelet stopped. But,
by improvements since cflccted, in the j
invention and use of locomotives on railloads,
a tract on of eight pounds s sutti- i
cient to move a ton of ?,*240 lbs-; so that '
a force of less than four pounds would j
now be sufficient to move the granite
block of 1,0S0 lbs. ; tnat is, one hundred ;
and eighty-eight times less than required ,
in the first instance. When, theiefore, ;
mere animal or muscular force was used j
to move the body, it required about two- j
tiiirds of itsown weight to accomplish the
object ; but, by adding the contrivances j
of mind to the strength of muscle, the i
force necessary to move it is reduced more J
than one hundred and eighty-eight times, j
Here, then, is a partnership, in which
minu contributes one hundred and eighty- 1
eight shares to the stock to one share con- j
trihuted by muscle ; or, while biute j
strength represents one man, ingenuity f
or intelligence represents one hundred
und eighty-eight men !

Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, and
t the perfection cf which is his chief happiness
| and glory as the lord temporal ot tii s planet*
1 Of this sublime art, all other art s and sciences
are but satellites, their business being to wail
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their muonfc'hine.
Consequently no man more man the
agriculturist needs Uie full use of his braros, 1
| and apeifoct command of all the treasures of
human experience. iSo the farmers of the
United Slates view the mailer; and in presenting
ihem with a translation of the c<*le.
brated .Unison Rustiquc, of the French, we
have no duuut of their hearty support. It ic
the work of ail works on practical agriculture
?the most scientific, clear, and ccmprehen- <
sive, France has long excelled in profitable I
I farming. This is lire source of her wca'th.
England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
agriculture is splendid, but sometimes costs j
more than it comes it). Those who have j
fortunes to spend may buy the vast works of!
Marshall, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon,J
&c., but there h ho wish to gel a fortune out,
of the soil will find the French writers better ,
able to chow them the way. The excellence }
| ol French elementary works is well known to j
all teachers. For centuries, the ?#/aisnn J
Rustiqiie has been, in France, the standard ;
