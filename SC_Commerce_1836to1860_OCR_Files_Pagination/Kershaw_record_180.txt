PROSPECTUS
OF THE
Camden Commercial Courier.
THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL
COURIER was rendered necessary by the inconvenience
to which our citizens have been subjected
for the want of a public channel of communication
which in a commercial community like Camden, is
essentially necessary, and consequently the COURIER
S claim on the public is such as should ensure
a liberal patronage.
The undersigned have spared no trouble or expense
in obtaiuing the best workmen in order to
render the Paper nil the advantages that it will
tdmit of, and affording satisfaction to its patrons.
In political matters the Courier will take no
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted
to the interest of all. which could not be effected
>y its entering into tne arena of Politics?it will
ie confined principally to such matter as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday

PEDIGREE.
FLATTERER was got by Muley (son of Orville
and the famous marc Elcanour) and is, there-!
fflfp. hiilC ltrr?lKr*r aI *?l J *
, vi inn (.cicmaieu iui]Hirit'u LiCViathcn,
of Tennessee, and of imported Margrave,;
winner of the Doncaster St. Legcr in 1832; his dam i
Clare, bred by Lord Egremont in 1834, waa got by i
Marmio'n, grandam Iiarpalice, by Uohanna, g gran 1
dam Amazon by Driver?Fractious by Mercury?.
Woodpecker?Everlasting by Eclipse.
Muley, tho sire of Flatterer, was the best bred son \
of Orvllle, the winner of the St. Legrr, and a most:
capita) Stallion, ha\ing cov. red at as high as jC52
Orville is the sire of Emilius, now covering at 50 ,
sovs., and grand sire of imported Priam, covering in '
this country at $150. Plcnipo,covering at 25 sovs., j
fall three winners ol'the Derby, imported Sparpedon,!
Oxygen, winners of the Oaks, imported Tranby,
imported Merman, &c. Muley is also the sire of
Vespa, winner of the Oaks, of Muley Moloch, imported
Leviathan, imported Margrave, &c. Muley is
out of Eleanour, the best marc of her day, having
won both the Derby and the Oaks. Eleanour (by
Whiskey, that famous getter of the stout sort,) is;
the grandam of imported Luzboiough, who?e get;
in this country, ran lart year with so much distinc-!
tion, and is sister to Crcsaida. Priam's dam.
Clare, Flatterer's dam, was out of Hatpalice by >
Gobanna, the best four mile horse of his day, and
as n stallion, equal to any of any age.
Flatten r, like his sire Muley, who was said to be
the largest boned, thorough bred in the kingdom,
in ml to be equal to 20 stone, (280 lbs.) is a horse of!
the largest size, full sixteen hands high, of immense
' power, large hone, great substance, good action, long j
stride, sound constitution, and excellent temper.? "
His color is a fine brown without white. It will he j
seen that his pedigree runs back to the famous old >
English Eclipse in an extremely short, and as rich 11
a line a* could be desired. i.
HISTORY AND PERFORMANCES.
Flatterci was bred by Mr. Noweli, in 1831, and i
run in England, by Sir Mark Wood. H was iinEorted
by Mr. Wadsworth, of Genceco, New York,
y whom he was placed in the stable of Robt. L.
Stephens, Esq., near the Untbn Course, Long Island,
who trained and run him in this country.?
His performances, both in England and in this country,
ore creditable to his nohle stock. His first appearance
in England was in his three year old form
(in 183d) fot the renewal of the two thousand guinea
stakes, at New Market, when he ran a capital second
to Glencoe, who has been imported iute this
country at a high figure. The following is the re- '
cord. I

Fiutierei was now purchased lor Mr. Wadsworth
and shipped for America. After an unusually long
passage, during wliich ho never laid down, he was
landed al JS?w York, the latter purt of July, 1835, j
was pi in training without the ixissibiiity ot pre pa-]
ration, but, notwithstanding, tan two very creditable
races, one of which, mile heats, he won, beating two
Eclipse colts and a filly by tlffe same horse in the
following spring, he was beaten by Mingo, three
mile heats, running second to him, and beating Cadmus,
by Eclinsc, Sydney, by Sir Charles, and the
Jewess, by Henry, in the first heat, when he wus
drawn.
Of this race the New York Spirit of the Times
contained the following account: "Cadmus bad
the pole, Mingo the out side. They got away in
a cluster, the Jewess making 'a sport between the
stand and first gale that quite used her up, when '
Cadmus and Flatterer took up the running, Mingo
and Sidney lying well up, the first under a hard
pull. Finding C admus disliked the pace, Willis
field him op after the second nnle and Mingo
headed the field witli ease. Flatterer maintained!
his stride to the end, running a very handsome
i % .: ?t- ~ r? - -2 1- -? *
bcuuiiu tu .tiiiijju, wuii, 101 a mngie mrce miles
can pull to the fastest horse in the country, and
come home ahrnd. Cadmus could not run in the
mud?and his friends did not expect much from
him, though he ran 2d the next heat, Flatterer
having hi en withdrawn alter a very creditable
performance. Sanford rode hint in tip top style,
and had he carried IGolb. would have flung the
mud in the face of the best of them."
Flatterer did not start in the fall nor succeeding
spring. He was purchased by W. L Corbin Esq
of Vu. and placed in the stable of J. 8 Corbin,
E q of Fairfield, who furnishes the annexed account
of his promise;*?'"In regaid to the promise :
Flatterer gave, while in training by me, of making
agool race-horse, I can with sincerity, and 1 think, .
truth, say that it was decidedly Hat ering. in his ,
mile triiil he beat "Whig" (a very fast horse) several
lengths, and exhibited very good symptoms at 1
"the finish 'of an ability to runs long distance sue- 1
cessivelj. I witnessed a race on Long Island,
last spring twelve months, between him and save*
ral other very sharp nags, two mile heats, in ,
which Flatterer was a good deal over "the foot" ol
-any of them. 1 considered him then a better horse
I than he showed tor, as he had had hot a po>>r chance
! to recover from the unusually long ana rough voy
age across the Atlantic, and the injudicious races
he had bt en made to run the Autumn previous,
vvry recently alter his lauding, Had bis frog been
sound, when he went into training this fill, be
would, undoubtedly, have made distinguishing and
succesful ioccs in the campaign I would as soon
breed from Flatterer as any untried Stallion in the
country. -His b'ood is aa pure as a horse's can be
and his family all run. Lie runs back very short,
ly to th Kngl:sh Eclipse, and is a horse of uncommon
speed Tiimaelf, and I think of bottom too.--*
His fine size, sho< Id ruconimend hini to breeders
who may have small or slight mi. res Hia action
is remarkably toot! indeed. 1 have ^iven the
Groom the requisite instructions, though from his
good temper none were ureded. His health and
appetite arc as good as can be- I turnc t him out
during the training on accouut of dikfratad frogs,
made so from standing in a foul eluhk at the Nortu.
W. L. L'orbin ?a.s of him, t!l am aire he will fulfil
the promise expected of him in Carolin.-."
Mr. White, ot Northampton county, who was
desirous of procuring Fiuttcrer to stand in that
county, aaya "I feci convinced that Flatterer would
be excellent Stock tor this section, as we have a
large number of Archie, flal, Tonsvn and Luzborough
mares. Such material, when built upon by

Variety,
Upwards of a hundred thousard persons
lately assemled at the Waterloo Dock at
Liverpool, to witness an extraordinary
feat by a man named Samuel Scott, a native
of Philadelphia. For a considerable
time before the event took place bets run
high, and much doubt and speculation
were abroad, the affair being considered
a hoax practised by the publicins, to get
together a croivd of npr?r?r?? in ?l?fl
c i ?v ,
borhood. At 12 o'clock, however, the
hero, for so indeed he was considered,
ascended the riggingfand amidst the shouts
and cheers of thousands, plunged head
foremost into the basin from a height of
193 feet. At half past two he announced
mother leap, which was accomplished
without accident. A considerable sum of
moucy was collected among the spectators.
It has been satisfactorily shown by a
writer in the " National Gazette, tnat
>-pbiiiiavcu ?/auuicn contain irom inrec to
four per cent of a poisonous Salt of Copper,
which is added by manufacturers to
give them a bluish white tint. It maybe
well that this be borne in mind by those
who occasionally use them in place of the
prepared Spermaceti of the shops" as
neclicities for colds and catarrhal affections
generally. In such applications*
this poisonous compound may prove other
than the sovereignest thing for an in
ward bruise."?Bait. Republican.
