Bradford, Wills Circuit, with Mr. John Pool.
Himself told me the following anecdote. Mr.
Pool was well known to Mr. Whitefield;
and having met him one day, he accosted him
in the following manner: .
Whitefield. Well, John art thou still Wesley
an?
Pool. Yes, sir, and I thank God, that I have the
privilege of being in connection with Mr. Wesley,
and one of his preachers.
Whitefield. John thou art in the Tight place.
My brother Wesley acted wisely. The souls
that were awakened under his ministry, he join
ed in class, and preserved the fruit of his labor,
This I neglected, and my people are a rope of
sand. ,
And what now remains of this great maws
labor? Scarcely anything. Multitudes were
converted under his ministry, and are now gone
to God, but there is no spiritual succession.
The Tabernacle near Moorfields, the Tabernacle
in Totten-ham-court-road, and one in Bristol,
with what is called Little School in Kings wood,
are all even of his places of worship, that remain;
and these arc mere Independent Chapels.—See
Clarke's MSS. Works.
Aftersuch testimony as this, from John Wesley,
George Whitefield, and Dr. Adam Clarke, con
firmed by the experience of a century, let no one
presume, for a moment, that the Methodist
Church con do better without than with class
meetings.
MISSIONARY
WATEREE MISSION, SOUTH CAROLINA
CONFERENCE.
To Rev. W. Capers, D. D., Superintendent ofSouthern
Missions:
Rev. and Dear Brother.—Through the South
ern Christian Advocate wo lay before you our first
quarterly report of this mission. We are encoura
ged to hope, that there is, to some extent at least,
ahealthful state of religious feeling in the church
here. The owners also appear to feel a deep and
abiding interest in the religious instruction and
training of their people. At most of the appoint
ments, the congregations have been very good, and
the most marked attention to the preaching mani
fested ; and also good order observed. We have
admitted 36 on trial, expelled 6, DroppeJ 2 ; ad
mitted 11 iuto fellowship, baptised S, and 3 have
died. During the third round vve administered
the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper at all the ap
pointments. The children are receiving catechet
ical instruction regularly ; and the aged, the in
firm, and the sick are visited at. their houses by
your Missionaries. We greatly feel the impor
tance and difficulty of the work assigned us,and
are often ready to cry out ‘‘who is sufficient for
these things ?” and yet, when we behold what
God has dune, and is still doing, for the coloured
population of the South, through the instrumen
tality of preaching, we “thank him and take cour
age.”

FERENCE.
To the Rev. W. Capers, D. D., Superintendent of
Southern Missions:
Dear Brother,—On this mission to tho coloured
people, we have no right to complain, so far ns the
members of the church are concerned. They are
endeavouring to lead a peaceable and godly life,
according to the word of God ; and are regularly
supplied with the ordinances of God’s bouse, and
the preaching of bis most holy word. Our increase,
indeed, is not what we could desire ; nor
have we succeeded in correcting all the tenden
cies to superstition, to extravagance, or spiritual
inactivity, which beset the path of a faithful negro
missionary, amongst a people such as we serve. It
is howevor encouraging to know that evident
marks of improvement show themselves : that re
ligious truth makes a lodgment in their conscien
ces ; and that the “foolishness of preaching” is
able to save even these, who believe. May God
graciously assist us in our work, and bless the la
bour of our bands.

MR. MOFFAT’S RECEPTION.
Thu Rev. Mr. Moffat, the iittrcpid missionary
in South Africa, left his station tor a season, about
two or three years since, to visit his friends in
England. The following paragraph describes the
cordial welcome with which he was greeted on
his return to the people, for whose salvation he
still labors in that land of darkness.
At length, at three o’clock on the morning of
the 13th of December, the long absent ones enter
ed their own habitation, and many of the people
had forgotten their slumbers, eager to see the
faces of their old friends. The daylight came;
and oh ! what shaking of hands! what beamiirg
looks of joy ! Some danced with delight, some wept,
and some silently looked up to heaven with heart
felt thankfulness. Every infant must shako hands;
grandmothers, blind with age, came, led by the
hand of a child, and though unable to look on the
faces they loved, they felt, with trembling fingers,
the well-known forms, and listened to the unfor
gotten voices. Wide and yet wider spread the
news, and large and larger was the glad gathering.
At one time there were twenty wagons on the
station, each with its full load of visitors. There
came the king’s brother, the haughty chief
Malturo—for haughty he hud been to his neigh
bors,—but. he had travelled ninety miles to wel
come the missionary and his wife to their long
forsaken home. And there, stooping with age,
came King Mothibi, and the old Queen Mahuto,
all motherly in manner and clean in attire. It
was sixteen years since she and Iter husband were
cruelly driven from the Kuruman, her eldest son
just cut oft' by death, and her spirit bowed with
sorrow ; and she thought she could never bear to
visit her old home again; but her mind has been
renewed, her heart broken once more, not by
earthly sorrow, hut by the power of the living God,
and here she and her husband come, with their
son* and daughters, to welcome back the messen
gers bt mercy.—Oh ! truly, “How beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of him that bnngetb
good tidings, that publisheth peace !”
Wesleyan Missions.—The financial state of
the Wesleyan Missionary Society for 1844 is just
published, and is as follows: Income £105,687
Expenditure £109,188, leaving a deficiency of
£3,501, which, added to the deficiency of 1843,
makes a total deficiency of £4,775. The income
of the6ocioty has increased during the year £4,045,
The reduced expenditure for the year is £3719.
Thus the Society has been increasing its income
and reducing; its expenditure. This statement ex
cludes the extraordinary debt on account of Afri
can missions, for which a special effort is making.
SOUTHERN CHRISflAN ADVOCATE.
FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1845
EQ—The proceeds ofthia paper will be equally divided among all

in aiiiing distressed and superannuated preachers, and the widows
and orphans of those who have died in the work.
THE WORLDLY SPIRIT.
Tithe has been in the history of Christianity
when the spirit of persecution opposed the chief
[ obstacle to the progress of religion, and invested
a public profession of the faith of Jesus Christ
with formidable difficulties. Open war has been
waged against the mild and peaceful faith of the
gospel; and tyranny in its varied forms has set
| itself to exterminate from the earth the very name
| of Christ and the last of his followers. A poli
tical espionage wielding the terrors of law, und
the force of opinion has grasped the scourge and
'brand; dug dreary dungeons, reared frightful
^scaffolds, kindled fires of martyrdom, and invent
ed instruments of torture, tor the men who held
fust the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus.
But the thrilling story of the church of Christ
tells us of the failure of all such means of vio
lence. The spirit of persecution, whether politi
cal with its hundred-eyed police and its legal en
actments, or pseudo-religious with its inqui
sitions and faggots, its chains and its ana
themas, has been foiled. The true religion
of the cross has, in the end, triumphed most sig
nally when the stress of outward persecution has
been greatest and most fearful.
In our day, however, the mode of attack is dif-1
fereut, and the danger lies in an opposite quar
ter. Persecution comports not with the en
lightened state of the world, and is abhorred
by the tolerant spirit of the time. Yet if we sup
pose that the hostility of the world to the spirit
ual, self-denying doctrine and discipline ol genu
ine Christianity, has been essentially ^changed,
we shall fall into serious error. Until the reli
gion of Christ converts the world, the latter will
always stand opposed to the former. And the
precise measure of the world’s hostility will be
found in the strength and purity of the organized
Christianity which denounces its frivolities or its
vices, its pride or ambition. This opposition
will of course be lessened on the other hand, just
as religion moves down from its high and ardu-'
ous position of rebuke and public testimony
against sin, into a mere meditative sentimentality,
and intellectual refinement,a set of decorous offi
ces and oratorial entertainments for Sunday, or
an imposing ceremonial for the vulgar, both
great and small. The ground of the world’s
quarrel with Christianity, is that it interferes with
the dominion of what is sensual; denounces the
thraldom of the passions; quickens the torpid
conscience to a perception of the eternal rules
and distinctions of right and wrong ; levels its
force against injustice, impurity, covetousness,
malignity ; demands humbleness of mind, purity
of heart, rectitude of life, faith in God and in an
unseen world ; and an absolute reliance for par
don and inward peace, upon the provisions of
grace through the death of Christ; and backs
all these denunciations and requirements with
announcing a day ol future retribution when
men shall be judged according to the deeds done
in the body. The unbending law of inward
holiness comprizing a practical belief of our im
mortality, a serious concern to prepare for it, a
communion by daily prayer and thanksgiving,
with God, and the governing purpose of pleasing
him, is utterly distasteful to the depraved propen
sities of the unrenewed heart. And where this
law is enforced by the dread sanctions of hereaf
ter, it is not wonderful that men evade, deny,
contemn its authority.
INow, no matter what torm tins hostility may
take, it still exists and operates. It is an active
element whether it wears the guise of seductive
pleasure; of thrifty, gainful, worldliness; of ac
tive antagonistic pride. Where is the harm of
being fashionable, asks one, provided we go not
to extremes. Good society sanctions this or that. |
Religion surely could not have been designed to
make our pleasures less. And thus upon the
credit of such saws and truisms, the frivolities of
fashionable life are turned in full flow upon the
unfortunate religionist. The world smiles con
descendingly to find him in the train of her vota
ries, and the palsy of her touch steals gradually,
but family over the moral sensibilities. lie is
brought to live more and more, for the present,
less forth e future. Sensual objects once more
assert the ascendency, Simplicity of character,
strength of piety, spiritual perception, power in
prayer, communion with God—all these are sup
planted one by one; the foundations of moral
principle are at length undermined ; and the ruin
of the soul is the result. The process has per
chance, been so gradual, the approaches of* the
foe so insidious, that no danger has been appre
hended. When at length a day of trial comes
on, and the soul casts about for means of resist
ance or grounds of support, it is astonished to
find that every thing is not right and sound.
Then it learns from a fatal experience that when
religion has once yielded to the levities and fash-'
ionable frivolities of the wordly spirit, that supre
macy which of right belongs to conscience alone,
it soon fades into a shadowy phantom, and ulti
mately loses its very being.
Then again, there is the vitiating and enfeeb
ling influence which the spirit of worldly gain
md secular craving, spreads over energetic and i
intelligent men, who are not awake to its tenden- t
cies. They despise the puerilities of the fash
ionable drawing room ; and look with contempt i
upon the stolen fopperies of costume andthelike,
with which weak-minded professors exhibit the
“vvould-if-I-could” of a silly hankering after the
world. A more substantial temptation assails
them, and solicits their vigorous endeavours,and
nrdcht pursuit. The worldly spirit assumes the
guise of a prudent provision for the future, a lau
dable desire to provide against the wants of ad
vancing life, the increase of our means and abili
ty to be useful, the additional influence which in
creased wealth may bring to the cause of reli
gion ; these and many such-like considerations,
plausible in themselves, have operated with fatal
force to destroy thevitulily of in ward religion,and
to sap the foundations of faith, hope, and spiritual
excellence. The good seed is choked by thorns,
briars, and weeds. The calm, trustful, simple
spirit, is overwhelmed in the vortex of worldly
anxieties, instead of growing strong by conflict
with and endurance of the trials of life—its de
pendence on God, its communion with Christ,
and its noble aspirations, after immortality hav
ing been first vitiated by the desire of wealth. -
That our country is peculiarly endangered at
this point, is past all denial. Of what advantage
is it that we possess improved mechanical con
trivances, and richer fabrics if our men ore pro
portionably deteriorated 1 Talk of the progress
of society, what is it worth if instead of giving
moral strength and elevation, it only rolls the
elements of degradation and corruption in its
flow. If we learn only the vices and follies of
continental Europe, the benefits of Atlantic steam
navigation are converted into a deadly curse to
this country. Better a thousand times the rude
manly virtues of a simple republic, than the fash
ionable courtesies, the refined sensualism of any
metropolis of the old world. Let France keep
her Paris, and England her London. We want
none of their polished degradation, none of their
conventional rerineinerits, none of their gilded
chains which enslave the moral to the sensual
element of human nature, and fasten to the earth
the soul which God made for immortality. We
repeat the eloquent and indignant words of one
of the ablest of our American writers. “I con
i less l look round on civilized society with many
fears, and with more and more earnest desire
that a regenerating spirit from heaven, from re
ligion, may descend upon and pervade it. I
paiticularly lear that various causes are acting
powerfully among ourselves to inflame and mad
den that enslaving and degradingfprinciple, the
passion for property. For example, the absence
| of hereditary distinctions in our country, gives
I prominence to the distinctions of wealth, and
holds up this as the chief prize to ambition. Add
to this, the epicurean, self-indulgent habits which
our prosperity has multiplied, and which crave
insatiably for enlarging wealth as the only means
ol gratification. This peril is increased by the
spirit of our times, which is a spirit of commerce,
industry, internal improvements, mechanical in
vention, political economy, and peace. Think
not that 1 would disparage commerce, mechani
cal skill, and especially pacific connexions
among states. But there is danger that these
blessings may by perversion issue in a slavish
love of lucre.”
j We ask for this subject an earnest and favor
able consideration, particularly on the part of the
young. While they are bound to consider the
peiils to which their religious principles are ex
posed, especially if their outward circumstances
are felicitous, they should at the same time pon
der well the results of their influence and exam
ple on others. To the members of our own com
munion we may speak freely. We bid them
remember the ancient glory ol Methodism which
stood in its simplicity, moral energy, lofty superi
ority ,o the frivolities of fashion, in plainness of
mess ana manners,as well mils strength ofpiety
and restless activities of zeal. The history of the
first three or four centuries of the church will tell
us that the forms of Christianity are not its es
sence; and that it is entirely practicable to pre
serve the circumstantials of religion while its
living spirit, its vital power, may be gradually
lost by a christiancoinmunion. Warned of such
dangers, let us cleave to the old paths. Let us
beware of the pride of sect, of the boast of our
numbers and increasing popularity. Let our
men of wealth distinguish themselves by the in
creasing largeness of their views, the advancing
liberality of their contributions to the noble cau
ses of Christian education, Christian missions, the
spread of the bible, the multiplication of church
es, and the efficient action of our ecclesiastical
machinery in all its departments. Let them re
member that while the life of the individual is
brief and fleeting, the existence of the church is
to be perpetual: and that all of us, each in his
measure, must needs advance or retard the opera
tions of the church, must needs add to, or sub
tract from its vital energies. Its prosperity stands
not in its popularity or respectability in the world
ly acceptation of that term ; but in its virtue : its
virtue is the outward expression of the holiness
of its individual members : and true holiness in
volves the consecration of the whole heart and
lije to God.
THE PHILADELPHIA CONFERENCE.
This Conference at its session just closed,
voted against changing the sixth Restrictive
rule: there being 104 for non-concurrence, and
12 in favour: 21 members were absent. The
real intentions of the North now begin to ap
pear; and this is a specimen of the Christian
pirit nnd equity with which the emergency is j
o be met. ;
We perceive from the “Repository” thnt the j
esolution in favour of the Christian Advocate
Sc Journal which appears in Dr. Bond’s letter
)f the 9th inst., elicited considerable debate, in
which Dr. Bond (proh pudorl) and Dr. Cooper
and others participated. The resolution was
not unanimously carried. The South has some
friends yet, in Philadelphia.

Omission.—We regret to discover that in the
list of delegates to the Louisville Convention, the
name of the Rev. Elisha Callaway, of the Alaba
ma delegation, was omitted. This was overlook,
ed in reading the proofs, and was an error wholl)
unintentional, which has caused us much chagrir
since our attention has been called to it.
Spread of Christianity.—We have says the
Commercial Advertiser, the most distinct and em.
phatic assurances in prophecy that the Christian
faith is ultimately to prevail throughout the whole
earth; that “the Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
preached in all the world”—that Christ “shall
have dominion from sea to sea”—that “all nations
shall serve him”—that “the mountain of the
Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the
mountains, and all nations shall flow unto it.”
What progress has been made toward the ful
filment of these sublime declarations we need not
undertake to show; our business is rather with
the means employed in their verification. It may
be well, however, to remark, in brief, that of
1,000,000,000 which may be taken, ii» round num
bers, as the population of the globe, the Christian
religion is now professed by 200,000,600, showing
a progress at the rate of more than 11,100,000 in
every hundred years, and of nearly 4,000,000 in
every generation of mankind.
But the inference deducible from what has been
done is of minor authority when compared with that
arising from the causes which are in operation.
We see and know that, whether as cause or con
sequence is not material at present, the Christian
nations are every where the possessors of power
and supremacy—that they are every where plant
ing themselves and obtaining dominion_every
where establishing their Bible and their faith—
every where the extirpation of idolatry is in pro
gress, with a power to which there can be no efTee
tual resistance.
Public Worship in London_1. When they
enter their pews, they at once engage, for one or
two minutes, in prayer. Episcopalians knelt for
the purpose. Dissenters bowed their heads
against the front of the pew. This gave to the
whole scene an air of solemnity befitting the day
and the place.
2. They have their pews as well supplied with
Bibles as with Hymn books ; and wheq the Scrip,
tures were read from the pulpit, each hearer took
a Bible and followed the reader.
3. I saw many persons, mostly young, taking
notes of the discourses, and, therefore, giving a
fixed attention, as if unwilling to loso a single
thought.
4. The congregations were remarkably quiet
wd attentive. Preaching of moderate worth was
listened to without any indication* of restlessness
>r contempt.
5. When the benediction was concluded, the
minis*er and people remained half a minute in
silence. Not a.pew jdoor was opened, not a hat
or glove taken, not a.foot-moved. % ...
G* I hey were exceedingly moderate in leaving
the house. In no instance did I see the aisles
crowded. They seemed willing to wait for one
another.
7. Gentlemen retired Irotu the house of God as
respectfully as they would from the house of a
friend they did not put on their hats until they
reached the door.
8. After retiring from the sanctuary, gentlemen
as well as ladies went home. The Host Office
was closed, and no letters or papers wore delivered
oil the Sabbath.—A. Y. Evangelist.
MifiHTY in THE Scriptures—The Canada
Christian Guardian has the following judicious
remark, which we commend to our clerical read
ers, in particular. “ Rev. George Gary, present
superintendent of the M. E. Mission in Oregon,
read his Bible through twice, by course, while on
his way to Oregon, between the first of December
1843, and the 27th February, 1844; or, in less
\ than three months ! An example of love to, and
diligent perusal of, the Scriptures worthy of imita
tion by Methodist and all other ministers of the
| Gospel. To be ‘ mighty in the Scriptures ’ was
the object to which the first race of Methodist
I preachers almost confined their studies. Let the
day come not when Methodist preachers will
make the study of the divine oracles a secondary
object. Let other ministers excel us if they can
in those branches of learning in which the Apos
. les were not versed; but in the knowledge of the
Word of God, let us be truly apostolic, and suffer
none to exalt themselves above us. The incident
spoken of brings to reinemorance that prodigy of
Biblical knowledge, that walking concordance, that
holy and useful minister, the Rev. Thos. Walsh,
one of the first of the Irish Methodist preachers.'
llis Hebrew Old, and Greek New Testament was
his daily meat. That noted Methodist preacher,
the Rev. John Smith, usually read twelve chap- i
ters daily, besides committing a portion to memory,
and which he would repeat while travelling from
one appointment to another. The best Missionary
ever sent out by the Church of England to pieach
the Gospel to the heathen, the Rev. Henry Mar
tyn, resolved at one time to spend as much time
daily in the perusal of the Bible as he spent in
other reading. An excellent example for a Min
ister.
Desighof the Apocai.yi'se.—Professor Sluart,
in an elaborate Commentary on the Apocalypse, re
cently published,, thus describes the design and
character of the book.
In the Apocalypse, “ Christianity is in a manner
personified, and it appears on the scene of action,
engaged in a contest with the powers of darkness
bo violent, that the struggle must evidently end in
the extermination or utter subjugation of one of
the parties. Successively one and another bitter
and bloody enemy of the Church is overcome ;
then follows a long period of peace and prosperity,
during which the influence of Christianity is bo
widely difiuseo, that no apparent hostility disturbs
it. Alter this the powers of darkness renew their
assault with exasperated malice and rage ; but the
• interposing hand of heaven smites them down,
and puts a final end to the contest. The peaceful
and universal reign of the Christian religion then
succeeds, and continues down to the final con.mm
mation of the Messianic kingdom on earth, when
the resurrection and the judgment day introduce
a new and perfect order of things, which is to
| continue through ages that have no end.
Such is the simple and perspicuous outline of
the Apocalypse. Tike all or nearly all particular
prophecies of the Old Testament and of the New',
it has one, and but one, main object in view, to
which all its various representations are subordi
nate, and to which also the particulars of each
several part are more or less subservient.
Nothing could be more appropriate to the time
and circumstances in which the book before us was
composed, than the theme which the writer has
chosen. Christians on all sides were agitated by
bitter and bloody persecution. Many professed
disciples of Christ were driven by fear, or allured
i by the hope of favor and worldly good, to renounce
their allegiance to the Saviour; while others ab
stracted themselves from his service and shunned
his followers, in order that they might avoid the
horrors of persecution. The author of the Apoca
lypse possessed Christian sympathies of too high
and holy a nature, to look on such a scene without
deep emotion. To prevent an evil of so great
magnitude, he was directed by the Saviour to
write the book of Revelation, and to publish it by
sending it to the seven churches of Asia.
It is filled, from beginning to end, with encour
agement and admonition and consolation to all
who were engaged in the great contest then going
on. Victory—victory—a final and universal and
eternal victory of the Church over all her enemies—
is echoed at every pause ; and a crown of glory is
held forth by the God and Judge of all, as ready
to be placed on the Martyr’s head, amid the joyful
assembly of the first born in heaven, the moment
he falls in the battle which he is waging. A most
fearful end, moreover, awaits the enemies of the
kingdom ot God. The worshippers of the idola
trous beast, the adherents of the false prophet, yea, i
the beast hiinsell, and the prophet, his coadjutor,
with Satan and all the powers of darkness, are
filially cast into the lake that burns with fire and
brimstone, where the smoke of their torment as
cends up forever and ever, while they are Buffer
ing the agonies of the second death.

Beautiful Picture,—The foreign correspond*
ent of llie Cbrisliau Observer, thus describes a
scene on the Rhine :
At four, P. M., meeting the eye at every turn of
the river, we reached Bingen, situated just on the
verge of the mountainous region of the Rhine. I
| found time that afternoon for a solitary walk to the
White Chapel of St. Roch, on the top of the high
lull above Bingen, and was rewarded by a most ex*
tensive and magnificent prospect, taking in toward
the South the broad, richly cultivated valley of the
Rhine, and to the North affording glimpses of the
grandeur and wildness of the mountain gorge be
low. The valley, a perfectly level plain, extends
along the river some two miles, and back from it
porhaps eight or nine; not a fence to be seen ; the
deep green of the vineyards, alternating with
squares of yellow grain, the flourishing orchards
scattered here and there, the winding road, border
ed with trees, the river, expanding here to its
greatest breadth, (about 2,000 feet, twice its width
below Bingen,) and studded with islands, present
a scene of uncommon beauty. Wisely does the
Roman Catholic Church select such spots as the
scene of her devotions, for who, with such a land
, scape before him, can be wholly insensible to re
ligious influences? The 16th of August is St.
loch’s day, and then thousands of pilgrims assem.
de at this place to offer their devotions.

towards Christians of other Churches, exhibiting
a fine character of active zeal tempered by pru
dence, of firmness and gentleness. His death was
sudden, and his memory is justly cherished.
Death of Dr. Sewall.—Dr. Sewall of Wash
mgton city, died recently by pneumonia. He was
an eminent physician, a gentleman of the highest'
fimsh of manners, a Christian of the puresf and
most lovely character. For many years he acted
as a class leader m the Methodist E. Church.
The Holy Land.—The influx of Jews to the
Holy land, has been very great of late. There is
no more room in Jerusalem for them ; they have
already passed over a part of the Turkish quarter.

SABBATH REFLECTIONS.
There is a King who reigns amidst the hosts
above, a spirit filling immensity with his presence,
and a Moral Governor also, dispensing gifts to
mortals, punishing vice, and rewarding virtue;
while with consummate shill he directs the hosts
above, and dynasties of earth. Jesus is the eter
nal Sovereign who reigns over the hierarchies of
heaven. Angels pure in nature, and spirits re
deemed from earth, are around the throne. No
discordant voices mingle in praise there. All
hearts are in unison : they are all intent but to
praise him, and speak and act to glorify' him.
There is from the light of Jesus’ face, a radiance
that disperses sorrow, satisfying the inmost desires
of the soul, causing extatic pleasure. The glori
ous champion, the mighty minister of man, pours
peace and joy in every breast. There love pre.
vails over fear, and timorous doubt gives place to
i joyful confidence. The moral and spiritual nature
l A8 purified : the soul no longer cold in its affections,
I or sluggish in its duties, perforins its ceaseless

known, so wantonly neglected? Why is it that
thousands depend on human approbation for hap.

forever sounding the kneli of time? .Why tread

their immortality, and place death in an obscure
and undefined distance?” Why not always iu

eyes. It couceals Christ from their view. It
produces unbelief with all the withering evils of

But Christ is the fairest among ten thousand, the

sketch on canvass the figures of a Raphael, and
Rubens, or chisel the forms of a Phidias: because
the hand is as unskilled in the one case to do the
work, as the heart is impotent and disinclined to
attempt the other.. “ Without me, says Christ, yo
can do nothing.” The heart is depraved; the
will unsubdued ; the understanding dark ; and tha
unronewed mind loves to remain so. They wilt
not go to Christ that they may have life. He

they gave it to the world. He says, “follow me:”
but they follow false gods, to honor and worship

in the Saviour of men, that they should desire him
to reign over them. A man of sorrows and ac
quainted with grief, is no object of love to the
sensual mind. The wurlding loves gilded palaces,
sumptuous feasts ; splendid attire ; and flattering
triends; for these the Lord of life and glory Is ne
