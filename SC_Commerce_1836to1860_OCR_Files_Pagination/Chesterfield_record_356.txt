Others had got a bad hewiach from tiic !..& 1

he would come if ho would send a

while one very cavulierly informed the

his fee of arrest.) One hatch having thus
been disposed of, the officer was despatched

North Eastern Boundary.? "he President
has sent to Congress a continuance of
the correspondence between Mr. Forsyth
and Mr, Fox, the aspect of which, is rath"r
belligerent. The Bri is!) Mi-lister complains
that Maine occupies a part of the disputed
territory, which she is not au:horis<HJ, under
the arrangement of last year, to occupy.
Strong threats ure made of exp ll ng fh"
citizens of Maine by military force. Mr
Forsyth on the contrary, insists that M i in",
^ has a right un ler the agreement to occupy
the territory, with a posse to protect the tmi.
Mr,* an I expresses the deternma-ition of the
:'Fcesident to support the sta'effihe exercis
^ ?fher rights. We cannot however, c nsid.
?r it posibln that the two governments will
go to war for so slight a cause.
9 make the following extracts from
he correspondence, which shew the pros
en* attitude of the parties.
Extract from the letter of Mr. Fox of
March 13.
Her Majesty's G vernment claim and
expect from th-> good faith of ho Government
of: he United Stat^, that the p>oi?lof
M <?ino shall replace themselves in the
situation in which t ey stood before th<*
agreements of hist year ivi-re signed?i n?t
they shall therefore retire from the valley of
the S*. John, and, confine themselves to jhe
valley of th" Aroosook ; that they shjll o<*.
cupy that valley in a temporary m inner
only, for tlie purpose, as agreed up, of pre
venting depre iat ons ; and that they shall
not construct fortifications, nor make roads
or permanent settlement. - 1
Until this be done by the people of the (
State of Maine, and so lohg as that people '
shall persist in the present system of aggression,
her Majesty's Government will ,
feel it their dury to mak? such military arrangements
as may be requited for the pto- |
tection of her Majesty's rights. And
her Majesty's GovernmerFt deem it
right to declare that if th?? result of the
unjustifiable proceed ngs of the State o*
Mane should be collision between her. Ma

tbe responsibility of air the consequences
that may ensue 'h refrom, be they what they
may, will rest with the people and Governmen*
of the United Suites.
^ The undersigned has been ins ruetcd to
mdd to this communication, that her Maps,
ty's Government are only waiting for the
detailed report of the British commissioners
recently employed to survey the disputed
territory, which report, it was believed,
Would bo completed and delivered to her
Majesty's Government by the end of the
present month, in order to transmit to the
Government of the United States a reply to
"'their last proposal upon the a^pci of the !
boundary negotiation. w .
From Mr. Forsyth's reply, dated, March
4 gbtk.
*'- :y As to possession and jurisdiction, they
weroto remain unchanged, each party holding,
in fact, possession of the disputed ter.
ntory, but each denying the right of the
other to do so. With that understanding,
Maine was, without unnecessary delay, to
withdraw her military force, leaving only,
under a land agent* a small civil posse,
armed or unarmed* to protect the timber
recently cut, and to prevent further depredations.
In the comphin's of infractions of the
agreements of tho State of Maine, addressed J
to the undersigned, Mr. Fox has assumed j
two positions, which are not authorized by
lite terms of those agreements: 1st ad.
muting the right of Maine to maintain a civil)
posse in the disputed territory for the pur. i
poses stated in the ngrernvnt, he djps so j
with the restriction that the action of the
nn?sn wn? tr? be confined within certain lim. 1
its ; and 2J, by making tho advance of the
Maine posse into the valley of the Upper
St. John, the ground of his complaint of
encroachment upon the Madawaska settle,
meat beyond those it occupied at the date of
the agreement.
The United States cannot acquiesce in
either of these positions.
In the first place, nothing is found in the
agreement subscribed to by Governor Fairfield
and Sir John Harvey, tiffining any Inn
its in the disputed territory within which the 1
operations of the civil posse of Maine were
to be circumscribed. Tno taskfof preserving
the timber recently cut. and of prevent,
ing further depredations within the disputed
territory, was assigned to tho State of Mum-;
fier her military force should have been
withdrawn from it; and i: was to be accomplished
by a civil posse, armed or unarm* d.
which was to continue in the territory, and
to operate ?o every part of it w here its agen.
cy might be required to protect the timber
already cut, and prevent further -Jepredaf.

As S' me of his distant friends aro probably mai
the readers of y?ur valuable p per, it is desired ancJ
that you p-rurit this notice to occupy a pi ce in
your obituary column, that the unwelcome intclli
guiie* may per chance be borne to some fond
school-tellow ofejrly days, some admiringasso.

Un.ve'romo us such intelligence may bo, to ~mr
know the worst w moro tolerable than susp?Mise.
The subject of this notice had sufT.tr- aro
ed for many mouths, perhaps for years, from a ant
chrome d-rang iiu nt of the functions of the
iiver. which could not be reached by the means
of the phy.Mci tii; for which he travelled the
la?t summer toth ? North, with thp hope that a I
change of air and so<"i ?iy, and mineral waters, ' Jot
might afford relief. Bat vain were his hooes ; prt
and the hopes of his friends. Me wan gridu. ?
ally sinking, till at last he has sunk into the still
silent grave.
The deceased left a widow and eight chaldron, }\
who. though they aro provid d with the means W
of a comfortable living, have to mourn this dire
misfortune. However great may socm to be the
privation of other friends, to these how much
mare thrilling t.ie sense of this irr parable calamity.
The friend above ail friends has lof them
I'orev r. The ties of corisangoinity, riveted by
a thousand associations, arc scver< d forever?
Tho ties of matrimonial affinity, endeared by a
thousand and ton IhtHisind sympathies and af.
factions; are sundered fmovcr. The pressure of
the culd hand, tbo quivering blue bps that essay,
t.d to pronounce tho last t.enediction. have left
their chilling impress on the heart?a perpetual
memento of sortow and grief.
But while it is melancholy to recount our
sorrows for the loss of a friend, it is cpnsolingto
contemplato his character as a good man. Th*

philosophic tnind,constituted by nature,and qualified
by *olf diciphr.o for a happy equan^r.ity, and
