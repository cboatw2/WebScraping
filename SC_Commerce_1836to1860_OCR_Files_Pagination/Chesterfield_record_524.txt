recommended.

It will be remembered that in our last ad*

Would test the sincerity of Kaleek*?those
eight days have passed and he has not

readers with surprise, that orders have not
been issued by the comanding General

warriors whenever opportunity offers.
The time has passed for negotiation with
these savages, or rather to use a legal

phrase, it hat expired by the statute of
limitations. It it to be regretted that the
gallant Col. Riley had not orders to catch
and hold on to these fellows, and it is
perhaps stil! more to be regretted that
voacoochee and twenty six of his warriort
who were with him at Fort Pierce,
were not detained and furnished with
quarters at that post.
The upshot of all this will be that the
Indians will take the field again, although
lliey are evidently so tired of fighting, that
if they had any enoouragoment to act in
good faith, by - the application of a severe
rule on ourv part, they would be more
punctilious in the performance of their
promises. Our troops will doubtless have
Mother summer campaign. They are
now so well acquainted with the country,
that they will burn up all the crops of the
Indians and distress them exceedingly,
which will lead, in all probability, to their
surrender in fhe ensuing autumn.
Our informant states that of 165 men

to the above items of intelligence, we may
add tbat several rumours have reached us

as we have heard it. If it he true,
we are prepared to say that a better selection
could not well have been made.

WEDNESDAY, Jcn? 16, 1841.
The Editor is -again at his post.
The dwelling and office of Dt. Hopton
of this town were both struck bv lightning,
during a thunder storm, last Thursday
evening. The dwelling was set on fire,
but the fire'was extinguished before it did
much injury. Some of the office furni.
ture was also broken, but the damage
was not grpat. The house was not protected
by .a lightning rod. The house of
Col. McCreight was also struck during
the same?tc?m, but no injury donei It
has a lightning-rod which is isolated with
horn* The wateb absorbed by the horn
may possibly have acted as a conductor
of th^-electric fluid to the iron ring
which surfobnded it. There is perhaps
no town or' village in the State in which
so many houses and trees have been
struck by lighting as Cheraw. Owing
to some unknown cause, there is probably
here a greater accumulation of the electrie
fluid than in most other places which
renders it very important that houses
should be protected by lightning rods;
especially wh( r? there are not trees near,
of rrealer he sht than the houses.
^ Documents Accokpaxying the Prrsi^
Dit.vr's Message.
These documents are free from the
prolixity of most American state papers.
They ire brief, practical and to the point.
They of course advocate the political
doctrines; and the favorite measures of
the party now in power. The greater
part of the report from the head of the
Treasury Department will be found in
our columns this week. In future numbers
we shall furnish such parts of the
other reports as shall give those of our
readers who see no other paper a view of
the state of the country, so far as it is
exhibited in these documents.
The National Gazette states that the
mission to England lias been offered to
Mr* John Sergeant, member of Congress
from Pennsylvania. It is not yet known
whether he will accept it or not.
We spent a day or two in Washington
the early- part of last week. There
seemed to be a very general disposition
among the members of Congress to enter
promptly and efficiently upon the business
before them. This the Senate Mas
likely to do; but the House of Representatives,
which is a more unwieidly body,
and contains some intractable spirits,
was more slow in its movements. The
general expectation was that a bank bill
I J L . I L a! I I I
wouia oe passea in doii nouses, ny decided
majorities; and it was hoped also
by the friends of the measure that one
might be framed which would he approved
by the President, liut nothing more had
^ transpired in regard to the President's
opinions o* the subject than is contained
in his published address and message. It
was rumored that the subject was the
topic of consideration at successive cab.
inet meetings about the time we were
in Washington; hut such rumors we
thought entitled to little credit. The

Congress.
A joint committee, was, on the motion
of Mr. Adams, appointed, early in the
^L-stion, ta report on the death of G m.
Harrison. Their report recommended
that the chairs of the presiding officers
be shrouded in mourning, during the ses.
sion, that the members and officers wear
the usual badge of mourning for 30 days,
and that a copy of the resolutions be sent
to Mrs. Harrison. The resolutions were
unanimously adopted in the House. We
happened to be in the gallery of the Senate
chamber when they were taken up,
and heard a solitary no on the question
of their passage. It was in the back part
of the chamber, and every member looked
back with a suddenness and expression
of countenance which indicated surprise
more strongly than language could do.?
We did not learn tfho the Senator was
that thus attracted unenviable attention,
but we observed that he had not the
courage to raise his voice on the subsequent
readings of the resolutions.
The same committee also Reported a
bill to pay the widow of General Harrison
fblankl dollars. The sum contemplated
V J
by the committee was a year's Salary of
the President, or $25,000. The bill will
probably pass with this sum.
In the Senate, Asbury Dickens has
been re-elected Clerk, and the other of.
ficers have also been re-elected. The
following Chairmen of the several coin,
mittees were chosen by ballot on the
third day of the session, viz:
Foreign Relations, Mr. Rivet.
I Finance, Mr. Clay.
Commerce, Mr. Huntington. Manufactures,
Mr. Evans.
Agriculture, Mr. Linn.
Military Affairs, Mr. Preston.
Militia, Mr. Phelps.
Naval Affairs, Mr. Mangurn.

Private Land Claims, Mr. Bayard.

According to a vote of the Senate,
the President pro. tem. of the body subsequently
appointed the other members of
the committees.
On motion of Mr. Clay, the Committee
on finance was instructed to inquire into
the expediency of repealing the Sub.
Treasury act. The committee reported

June. The bill was taken up and discussed
on Monday and Tuesday the 7th and 8th,
and passed on the latter day by a vote of
30 to 16, all the Whigs and Conservatives
voting for it, and all the Democrats
against it, except Mr. Buchanan of Pennsylvania,
who stated that he voted for the
repeal, against his own judgment, but in
obedience to instructions from the Legislature
of his state.
On the 8th June, Mr. Clay offered a
resolution calling on the Secretary of the
Treasury for a plan of a Bank, adapted,
in his opinion, to the public service.
This resolution gave rise to considerable
debate in which Messrs Clav, King,
Woodbury, Wright, Calhoun, Buchanan
and Rives took part, and the resolution
was finally adopted, after being so moditied
as to call for the plan of a "fiscal
agent or bank" instead of a "bank" simply.
On the 7th Mr. Clay offered a set of
resolutions specifying the following as
the subjects to be acted upon at the pres.
ent extra session: 1. Repeal of the
sub-treasury ; 2. The incorporation of
a bank ; 3. Providing revenue by dutie9
and loans to pay the debt contracted
by the last administration; 4. Prospective
distribution of the proceeds from
the public lands; 5. Appropriation bills;
6. Modification of the banking system
of the District of Columbia. He said
it was not his intention, then, if at all, to
call for a vote on these resolutions. He
offered them only as an expression of his
opinion as to the business which ought j
to occupy the attention of Congress at !
the present session. They were, on his j
motion laid on the table and ordered to :
be printed^
House of Representatives.
On the first day of the session Mr. Wise
moved that a committee of nine be
raised to revise the rules, and that till i
their report be made, the House be'gov.
emed by the rules of last session. Mr.
Adams moved to except the 21st rule
which provides that petitions on any sub.
ject relating to slavery be laid on the
table without debate. Mr. Adams consumed
nearly ail the first week* and
Monday of the second week, in discussing
this motion which finally prevailed
on Monday June 7th .>y a vote of 112 to
104, being a majority of 8 for the repeal
of the rule which excludes the considers,
tion of abolition petitions. A few Southern
members voted for the repeal, for the
purpose of separating the abolition
question from the question of the right
of petition. The abolitionists will raise a
shout of triumph at this decision, and
some men at the South may be alarmed
at it. But there is no ground for either.
Nothing has advanced the apparent
strength of the abolitionists at the North
so much as confounding thei^cause with
"right of petition." The questions will
now be separated and the thousands who
hitherto signed abolition petitions merely
to vindicate, as they supposed, "the aacred
right ofpetition" will do'ao no longer.
Mr. Ingersoll, on the 6 th of June, i
that is, the day after Mr. Adam's motion I
was adopted, moved a re-consideration of i
the question. The motion was taken up i
the next day, and he spoke upon it till the
House adjourned.
Mr. Wise's motion, at modified byJIfr.
Adam's was adopted.
The following standing committees

This is the day for the meeting of the
27th Congress under Gen. Harrison's
Proclamation. The Alabama members
hare not arrived, and will not be here in
time to take any part in the organization
of the House. The Mississippi members
will not be here forsometime, and Illinois
has not held her election. There being
also two vacancies in Pennsylvania* The
House will hate* at present, only 230
members* Several of those too, will be
absent at the opening of the session*
WAsittaoToif, June 1*
The organisation of the two Houses of
Congress was effected yesterday* Mr.
Southard, President pro tempore of the
Senate, took the chair of that body, and a
quorum was formed and the usuai prelim*
inary business attended to. The Sena*
tors all appeared to be in good health and
spirits. ?
Mr. White was elected on the first bal*
lot, having 131 vdtwout of 221 that were
given. Mr. <Wiw received ? voies, .nr.
Lawrence of Pa. 6, Mr. J. W. Jones, 94,
and there were a few scattering* There
were six Whigs who did not vote at nil,
hut who would eventually have voted for
Wise, in case he obtained such a sup.
port as would have rendered their votes
avuilable.
The Caucus nominee for the Clerkship
did not succeed so well. Mr. F 0 J
Smith obtained 90 votes on the first bal.
lot, and the same number on the second,
[t was evident that his whole force had
been brought out and that he could not
get another whig vote., it appeared also
that Mr. Clarke, the otd.aod very efficient
officer, who was turned out by the Jackson
party, eight years ago, was the choice
of the non.content whig*, though he
could only raise 38 whig votes. The
locos had an invincible repugnance to going
for Mr. Smith, for two reasons?one
that he was a conservative, and the other
that he was the regular candidate of the
whig party# They would not give him
one vote; and, finally, they adopted Clarke
as their candidate, and gave him nearly
eighty votes, by which he was elect,
ed.
A resolution was adopted for the ap.
pointment of a joint committee to wait
on " the President," and inform him thai
the two houses were assembled and ready
to receive any communication from him.
While this was under consideration, Mr.
McKeon, of New York, moved to strike
out the words '* President of the U. S."
and insert ur Vice President of the U. S.,
acting as 'President." Mr. McKeon
went into an argument to shew that Mr.
Tylcb had nc claim te the title of Presi.
dent, though the powers and duties o'
that office devolved on him.
Mr. Wise resisted this view, and hoped
the House would.recognise Mr. TYLcnaa
President?he having become the Presi.
dent by the action of the Constitution,
by the votes of the people, and by the act
of God* The House was unwilling to
entertain any discussion of the subject,
and rejected the motion very promptly.
Mr. Wise moved that the rules of the
last Houss be adopted for the government
of this for the present, and that a com.
mittee of nine be appointed to revise the
rules forthwith.. Mr. Adams moved tc
amend the motion by rescinding the 21sl
rule, which rule was adopted at the be.
ginning of the last Congress, for the pur.
pose of excluding abolition petitions.?
Pending this motion, the House adjourn,
ed. Every one laughed when Mr. Adams
made the motion.
Domestic Silk.
Wecopy the following from the Ral.
eigh.Star of last week.
We had the pleasure of inspecting, a
few days ago, some articles of silk, which
casually fell under our observation, raised
in the family of Cyrus Whitakes, Esq,
of this country; and manufactured by Mrs,
Whitakeb herself, which are decidedly
the handsomest specimen of domestic*
we have yet seen. They consist of glove?
stockings and hanks of reeled silk, which
we believe to be equal in all, and superioi
in tome repects to the finest production?
