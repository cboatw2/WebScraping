TIE subscriber in lor.lis the p-iblic, Hint he has
just oo.ii|ilete<1 the mixture of this valuable me?
divine. He tnkes pleasure in stating that he has
made use of tins I* \ .NT A. " E A, succcssful'v in a case
of Scrofula, which lie has liven alHicted with more
than tiirke years. On several occasions he applied
to practicil Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
and received no benefit, lie was, at length, prevailed
upon hv numerous acquaintances, to try the
virtue of ccrt.iift R H)TS ami IIERBS; and believing,
'hat the Receipt would greatly benefit him,
he took it, togethc with an old P ench Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper here to ?iv, thnt the duality of some,
or u.i. the principal Roots are well known to the
Medical Faculty, hv whom they arc frequently used.
F ?r Scrofula or King's Evil, iT|cernted Sores. '
general diseases of the BLOOD, or the Gleets of
Mercury : it has a decided saluturv i-flect.
For Bowki. Oompi.aint he would also recommend
he use of I'm- VE IE TABLE PANACEA. ' hilfren
-ire frequently attacked wi'o this complaint :
specially when teething. .A few doses ot the PANACEA
will check the Bowels. and they become regular
again. It has l>eon tried by a great number of
espectable individuals, and pronounced a ' certain
sure." lie bus tried it at difterent tine s in his own
family, and it relieved the child im uedi nely.
This Vie Heine is simple in its operations; and has
a ple.is.u.t taste.
(live it a trial, and iu<lnc its worm.
The suliscihcr will keep a constant supply of the
Pavacka at the different IV.ig Stores throughout

IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs
the puMic that be has completed the mixture of
the VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is
eo.njioscd of Roots which grow in this State. It is
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) ns it is well
known that am. Roots have valuable Medical properties.
lie would also slate that there is not the
least danger ill the use of the Ei.ixir. Por the following
named diseases, there is no medicine made or
vende I at the present time, better calculated to relieve
the afflicted, than the Vkgktablr Elixir.
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir
should he used internallv and externally.
Por Dyspepsia or Dysury, lie would also recommend
the use ot the Elixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly neneficiul to those who use it.
To those who are alflcted with Pustules, F.ruptive
Distempers, and Venere d diseases, he p irticnlnrlv !
recommenis the use ot the Vl',(iKT A RLE LLIXIR.
Without the tear of contradiction, he rccom urndstliig
\1 cdicine as the oust now in usi?as it has proved .
nucccusltil in every case in which it has been used.

what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, I have
losav. tlnjt I saw it work on Saturday I hi* 2f>th inst.
ind was very much pleased with its perlormancc. rr
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to
lie a very valuable improvement; and besides, the
iju ility of the cotton, ns it comes out of the pro- "
'.ess, apjieared to me to be better and clenner than '''
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves j m
considerably in labor. Respectfully, &e. ' a'

Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
iccompitnicd by a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leave to observe, that it
xliibils n d< cid? d unprovt menl on the usual pro:ess
of ginning; delivering the staple uninjured
ind tree from nap or trash, clean and of gcfcd co??
lor ; thereby giving the article an additional value.
ri.OHO fuvoiublr impressions of the advantages of
pour Patent Gin, have been confirmed by subsequently
witnessing it in operation. The utility of
he double cylinders and saving of labor, will be
cudily perceived and properly opj rcciatcd by the

I-eeling u deep interest in the snccess of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples

Dr. A. J o' os?Dear Sir, in answer tc your inqui y
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
>eg leave to state', that 1 wub fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Engand,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
oreim n in the houfce.of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
it Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Vlessrs. landlord & Greene. I have seen your
7otton Gin in operation, and have examined the
otton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleaned,
and the stuple less injured, than any cotton
hat ever came under my observation. It is completely
ren- y lor the breaker without the aid of the
lower, and would, thercjfwc, save the first process
n manufacturing the article. 1 c? nsidcr cotton
.leonsed by your Gin, would con mnnd from one
o two cents on the pound more than tho?average
:iop8 brought into the Manchester market, and
deansed by common Gins Yours, very rcsp'ly.
