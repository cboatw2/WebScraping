Indeed there seems to be an immense !
population here, who have nothing under 1
the sun to do, but to run here and there '
to see what is going on. Thou-unds are !
D r
always wandering idly the streets, thronging
the puplic walks, and on the qui rice i
for every excitement. This class of the
population is more evident to the stranger
when the bell rings for fire. Then there
is a general rush front every lane, alley,
groggery, and vile sink of filth and infamy,
and the pavements are thronged with
crowds of ill dressed men; boys and females
hastening to the coullagration, and
for no earthly object. There are regular
firemen, who are alone the allowed combatants
with the daily fires hero, f rom
one fire the nioh rushes to another always
on the move---a restless, mischievous and
dangerous raultiude. And this class of
population is still increasing. Within a
few days, fifteen hundred homeless and
often penniless emigrants, were landed in
the city.
I am not much giver, to the prophetic
vein. But if events cast their shadows be
fore, we must be indeed blind it we do not
see them. There is a restlecs spirit in
the "mob population" of New York daily
breaking out from the most trivial causes,
which, unless checked by severe nmncipal
regulations, is destined to overwhlem this
city. It is gathering in every lane, alley
and low bar room?it is rapidly gathering
to a head and soon will burst, when New
York will experience the most stupendous
raoA ever known in this or any other country.
This spirit must and will have
vent. P.
The Express Mail.?We are not a little
surprised to find several of our conteinpo.
raries objecting to the Post Master General's
establishing an express mail between
this city and New Orleans, which shall perform
the whole distance in sb instead of
thirteen days, carrying letters only, at three
times the customary postage. But it* wc
are surprised at objections to such a measure
in a commercial community like this,
we are still more surprised at the grounds
upon which those objections are based.
One editor tells us that he will not be
able to meet the increased expense of paying
three times the ordinary letter postage
on newspaper slips, and another that letters
will anticipate and render useless lor cornniercial
purposes, his newspaper, and consequently,
he will lose his circulation in
New Orleans! These arc rare objections
indeed, and our especial wonder is, that editors
should be found foolish enough to give
publicity to thein. What has the Governinent
or the commercial community of the
( nited States to do with the fate of this or that
or any newspaper, that a great national measure
should be discussed upon such grounds ?*
Newspapers are entitled to public counte
nance and support just so long no longe r
as they continue to be useful in imparting
early information and sound principles
; and if any other mode can be adopted
by which early Commercial information can
be so generally distributed, the Press has
no more right to complain than Type-founders
and Compositors have because Bookjnanulacturers
chose to cheapen their labor
by the employment of Btereoty{>c plates.
Let us suppose that even printing itsel (should
bo superceded by the discovery of some
new process?would it bo good ground of
objection to such process tliat its general
adoption would injure those engaged in the
printing business ?
That the Express Mail will render the
Courier d* Enquirer, Jonrmil of Commerce
and other papers useless to those merchants
in New Orleans, who take them solely on
account of their early commercial intelligence,
there can be no doubt; but we cannot
discern in this any good reason why we
should oppose the measure, much Jess any
which should for a moment be taken into
consideration by the Tost .Muster Ueneral.
If he can accomplish the truly desirable object
of expediting the mail between the great
commercial marts of the country, as is
proposed, we care not if he impose six times
the customary letter postage;; .and if that
will not cover the expense, we would unite
in urging upon Congress to make an annual
special appopriatioUj lor the purpose,
even it should be the certain cause of losing
# O
every subscriber we have in the Southern
States. The benefirs of such a measure
would be incalculable to the commerce of
the country, and in the inert; item of Exchanges
alone, would save millions annually
and in fact, operate as an increase of nearly
one-half in our commercial capital employed
in this way. In 1935 the Bank of the
United States alone, did two hundred and
forty-millions of domestic exchanges, and at
this time the whole domestic exchanges ofthe
country in one year, probably amount to
four hundred millions of dollars. The
greater portion of this is on the route of the
proposed new mail arrangement, and it is
only necessary to remind the reader than
it will require less than half the actual capital
to accomplish this under the proposed
Express Mail system than at present to demonstrate
to him its incalculable value.
That this will be the result evident, as the
dullest capacity can comprehend .that any
person can do double the amount of business
in Exchanges, when he can turn his
capital every twelve instead of every twenty-six
or thirty days. W hv the bare annunciation
of the establishment of this Express
Mai!, would do more to render money
abundant tharfthe combined efforts of all
our Banks; and for the very good reason
that one-half of the immense capital employed
at this time in domestic exchanges,
would immediately become idle and seek
other avenues of investment. That " time
is money" is a trite adage; and in nothing
? O ' o
is this more clearly illustrated than in the
whole system oTExchanges, whether Foreign
or Domestic.
But independent of the effect of this express
mail on exchanges, what safety and
security will it give the merchant and plan"
ter against the speculators when private expresses
are constantly rushing through the
jjoufctry with intelligence in advance of the
1 ?
the advantages of rises and depression in
the great staple commodities of the countrv.
! We do not mean to censure such enterprise.
! If is rendered necessary by the competition
j of the age; but we do mean to say, that i;
is a sacred duty which the government owes
the farmer an J ;ho planter, to put it out of the
j power of any s?>rt of men to take advantage
i of their ignorance, arising from the snail,
like course of the public mails from one pari
i of the country to another. It is a species
1 of protection that the (iovernment solemnly
i pledged itself to bestow in consideration of
i being invested with the sole direction and
j control of the Post Office Department; and
i oar only wonder always has been, that
i the farmers and planters generally, have

A r.BEAT PROJECET?TIIK N. E. BOE.VDAItV.
The plan which the Canadians and the
I of a Rail Road from Quebec to St. Andrews J s
j in Now-Brunswiek, or to the city Sr. Johns, i 1
! on the river St. Johns, so as to make, as it is i v
said, the Sr. Andrews a wharf, and the Bay t fi
of Fundy a harbor lor the St. Lawrence, is | c
one of tiie most magnificent that lias yet i
been projected uponjhis continent, and cal- 1
culated to involve ultimately the most im-i
portant political consequences. The idea j
was stolen from the Maine Legislature, ,
where the project was originally started; j
I hut (ireat Britain, with that sagacity and j
i foresight that distinguishes Jill her political (
| movements, has taken it up and adopted it, ^
{ and is likely, for want of sufficient enter'
prise in t!ie .Maine Legislature, no: only to j
i rol> that State of the honor and t!ie profit, j ^
I hut even of the territory over which ir is ah. j
solutely necessary to construct the road, j
Hence.undoubtedly, the reason why Sir'
Charles Vaughan, in his correspondence | t
1 with our government relative to the X. L. ,
? I (
Boundary, alter the starting of the project. t
| refused even to fall hack upon the award of j
' the King of Holland jis to tin* dividing line 1 .
between Maine and the Brittish Provinces, i
j though he was very willing to adopt that line I *
immediately alter the award. The object |
i of the Brittish government now, is to secure ' .
enough ol* this disputed country to make a i
Rail Koail upon, between the Bay ol'Fundy !
and Quebec. The Hon. John Holmes, late '1
i U. S. Si-iia'or, says, in a letter to the Port- c
I land Advertiser, that this road, an act of in- '
i corporation lor which passed the LcgislaJ
tare of New Brunswick and Lower Canada
J in December last, is to cross near one '
i hundred miles through the State of .Maine, i (
including a tract of one hundred miles hy
! fifty. Mr. Holmes, therefore* very naturally j
|: calls upon the (lovcrnor of Maine to adopt; 1
such a course as shall avert all foreign leg- ; '
isiation a\ itliin the jurisdiction of Maine, or is
#'v? n within the disnutcd territory. The : *
Governor of (\mada, Lord Gosford, it ap-i(

j ?not only on account oi'tho greatness of *

Government is now fitting up one of the j

' along our Southern and Northwestern Tor- ]

: taken from the great military* and naval do-! <
pot at Halifax, and upon the St. Lawrence ! ]
' from Quebec to Lake Ontario. The difli- j \
cult and dangerous navigation of the Gulf!

of St. Lawrence is thus avoided. St. Johns, I '
* . I
! in population and wealth, being the great j !
j outlet oftlie vast Lake and St. Lawrence j J
country, will soon rival New York. The ]
j British will also thus have a port where their ]
I produce can be sent to and from the . ]
I West Indies. Military and commercial

ANOTIIKR LAND OFFICE FRAUD. ' [
The following facts have been related 11
| to us, upon respectable authority, and 1
! name's left with us, which will f>e given, \
: whenever the statement is dented by those
j concerned in the transaction. t i
| A few days ago, a person applied to the (
i new Register of the Bucyrus Land Office,; I
| i John Caldwell, Esq. (Mr. Gillispie having < (
j resigned,) to enter a tract of land in Wood j \
j County. The Register, not being well | i
! acquainted with the plats of his office, and j 1
fearing the land might be in the L'. S. Re-}
servat ionoftive miles on the Maumee,which !
i * . t
-j is not for sale, replied to the application thatj j
he would consult the Receiver, Joseph f 1. j I
, j Larwill, and if the tract did not lie within j ;
i the said Reservation, he shourd have if.? ; \
The applicant went himself to the Receiver |
, and obtained from him a written statement | i
, that the land in question was not within 1 (
the (J. S. Reservation, and might bo en- ( (
tered. This he presented to the Register,, (
who told him that he should have the land j r
! ?but as it was then five o'clock, and time ; (
| to close the office,he must call in the morning ! '
: and his entry should be made as be desired.' j
| The applicant was the last man who left i i
; the office that day, and the first to appear j
tops for sometime, wailing lor the office to j t
10 opened, !io was at length admitted, and 1 g
vas then informed hy the Register that,
>oun? LartrUf, brother to the. Receiver, had t:
nte.rcd the tract which he wanted! s
AND YET ANOTHER, i Jl
We learn from the same authority, that '
lot longsincc a farmer entered the Huevrus ^
-<and Ofliee to purchase several small tracts ; '
or his children. It was in the afternoon,and ' '
lefore he had paid for all his entries, Mr. I
Liarwill closed the olfice, as the hour had j ^
o/ne, and the purchaser was told he must ,
inish his business in the morn in?. rriie , J
text morning when he called, i/ouriLC fl/V. !
hand II had entered and paid for all the

From Spain we liL.e accounts of the arrival
if Cordova at his head quarters, and of his
narchinghvith two of his divisions on Logrono.
)n the 'idth inst., the main body of the Queen's
Troops had been attacked by the Carlists, who
lad been repulsed with the loss of 400 men,
nd 0:1 the 'J7th, a separate attack was made
in the English line at St. Sebatian, which had
;lso failed with a loss, according to the French
,ccount, of thirty men. It is said , that the
general election in Spain has already produced
10 less than 130 sure votes for the new minhsry,
and there are other indications which give
t some promise of stability.
russia.
The following particulars relating to the forign
and -domestic trade of Russia are exiractd
from a late number of the Petersburg!! Ga
:ctte, iii which it is admitted tiiat one haifthe
xports of the empire are sent to England altho'
lot more than a twentieth part of the exports
?f England are sent to Russia. In the year
.835 the total value of the exports amounted |
n roubles to 230,419,880, including 10,656,341 j
ent to Poland and 2,440,993 to Finland. In !
he same year the imports from foreign counries
amounted to214,324,630 roubles, from Pound
2,798,804, and from Finland 969,919. The
allowing is a comparative statement of some
>f the leading articles of raw produce imported
nto Russia in the year 1832,1833, and 1834
espectively. The figures represent poods, a
)ood being equal to rather more than 26 lbs.

From the tables it is to be inferred that even
in Russia manufactories are making considerable
progress, from the increase in the amount
of importations of raw produce coinciding with
the decrease of manufactured articles. Three
fourths of the whole exports of Russian hemp .
and more than threefourtiis of the exports of
tallow are sent to England, without counting
the shipments for Elisinore, which in tlie end
have the same destination.

MEXICO.
Accounts from the city of Mexico, of the 29 th
June, state that Congress was still in session,
and that the treaty made between Santa Ana
and General Rusk, was then under consideration.
Another letter of the 2d July, is to the
the following effect: That the force loan had
thrown all the foreign merchants into a state of
alarm, and that they had protested against it
through their respective Ministers.
TKXAS.
"We hail heard a riunor last week which w?a;.l
did not credit for want of confirmation, that tho
Texians had attacked tho Mexicans and defeat,
cd them, killing 90U without any loss on their
part. .The last accounts front New Orleans
represented the armies as within a day's march
of each other?the Texians confident of their
strength and burning for the conflict. Since
then we have received an Alexandria paper, giv.
ing tlic snme account of a battle, which rumour
came in simultaneously from the Sabine and
New Orleans. A gentleman from Lafayette informs
us that he has conversed with a wan direct
from Texas via the Sabine, wh o confirms
the rumor. Upon the whole, we think it far
from improbable.?
MEXICO AND TEXAS.
The New Orleans Bee of 5th of August contains
a Proclamation of David G. Burnett.
President of Texas, declaring the Port ofMetamoras,
in' a state of Blockade, by the Tdxian
anned vessel Brutus, Terrible and Invincible.
The latest accounts state that the Mexican
Government have opened their ports to all kinds
of provisions, during the war, imposing an ad
valorem duty of ten per cent: another account
says forty per cent. The Blockade of Matamoras
by the Texian cruizers does not appear
to be very efficient. Mexican and Americ
an vessels pass. There are rumours of threatened
revolution in the interior of Mexico. A
decree has been published levying a. forced
loau, not to exceed $2,000,000. The Mexican
army is reported to be still inactive at
Matamoras.
The Texian elections take place on the first
Monday in October?Gen. S. H.* Austin is
announced as a candidate for the Presidency.
A New Orleans paper of the 4th inst says:
' It is confidently stated that the'Mexican fmc^
at Matainoras alone, exceeds 15000 men, now *
tho hnrptnfnm hnrftp* art* npatlv
all concentrated together. Upon the whole, it %
is evident that the Mexicans are fully determined
tipon retrieving their lost fame by some
desperate effort.
Natciiitociiis, (La.) July 22.
News have reached us stating that the Mexican
army is again retreating to Matajnoras,
in consequence of the Cholera having broken
out among them, and committing great destruction.
We learn from undoubted authority, that
several tribes of Indians have collected on the
Sulphur Fork, in Texas, and preparing for hostilities,
in behalf of the Mexicans.
Gen. Rusk has ordered the Mexican families
on the Guadeloupe and La Baca, and ail those
who were likely to afford information to the
enemy, to retrire upon the Rio Grande, or take
themselves off to Colorado. Corhajal de Leon
and some others, intend mafcing a summer sojourn
in New Orieani. Health to them!

A letter published in the Columbus Enquirer
of the 11th, from Major AJford of the Georgia
militia dated: Camp Hacey, Aug. 6, gives
an account of another engagement with a
party of Indians in die same swamp in which
Capt. Jernigan's men had previously had two
engagements. At the commencement of the
battle a ball slightly wounded major Alibrd.
His lite was probably saved by a large knife in
his pocket, against which the ball struck. The
Indians were routed by a charge immediately
after the commencement of the action, and
escaped leaving neither wounded or dead behind.
No account is given of the wounded or
dead among the whites.Chcrokees.?We
were misinformed in relation
to the hostile movements of the Cherokees,
alluded to in our paper of last week.

Washington Mirror.?We have received
the first number of a new series of this paper.
It is published twice a week in Washington
City by Rufas Dawes at five dollars per annum,
and supports General Harrison for the Presidency.
It is conducted with spirit and talents,
and is calculated to produce a favourable
influence upon the growing popularity of the
General.
Lincoln Transcript. W e have received
the second number of a spirited little paper' *
with this title, published in Lincolnton, N.
0. by A. R. Porter & Co. It is Whig in politics.
* . j
It is stated in the Danville Reporter that a
letter was ."ound among the papers of the lateGovernor
Burton of N. Carolina from Gen.
Jackson, stating that Texas would certainly
be annexed to the U. States and offering the
rix-Governor the Governorship of the Territory.
We cannot credit without direct and
positive testimony! a story which if true, i
would be so discreditable to the President.
It is also said that the President, on his way
home, expressed himself as being opposed to
the Cincinnati and Charleston Rail Road, because
it is a party measure. Whatever prejudice
the President may entertain against the
individuals most prominent in getting up this
splendid national work, it would betray so
much puerile weakness to transfer this prejudice
to the work itself that we hope the rumour
will turn out to be a party slander.
