Resolved, That it shall be the special
duty of the members, at as early period as 1
possible, to convene the planters of their
neighborhood, or to embrace the first op- 1
portunity of a public meeting of the people,
in order that the private and general ad- 1
vantages of local associatious for promoting
the interests of hushandry may be 1
fully discussed^ and thoroughly understood,
and the foregoing resolution thereby car- '

might deem proper, to unite in furthering i '<
the object in view. f
Resolved, That the Legislature be res- ?
pectfully invited to employ a competent
person to effect an Agricultural Survey of
the State in the manner that task has recently
been performed in Massachusetts, 1
and that a committee be appointed to me- f
moralize them on the subject. i
[The Chair nominated the following
committee : Dr. Gibbes, Gen. Means, B.

for arriving at the most accurate inbrniation.

lievc that if they were disposed to arrive
at the most accurate conclusions on the
subject, that they would estimate the failure
of the uplands crop of the Slate of
South Carolina, for the year 1840, at fiveeigths
of the crop of 1839, which amounted
to 301,539 bales, and which would
make the present crop 188, 480 bales. |
Rut believing that the safer course would
be to under, rather than over-estimate*the
failure, with a view to give greater confidence
in the future reports of this Society,
they have concluded to fix the present
crop at about 200,030 bales. Your committee
regret that they have not been able
to procure as ample information, in relation
to the Santee and Sea-Island cottons,
as they could desire, but believe that the
failure will be very nearly one half of the j
crop of 1830.
EDWARD G.rALMER,
Chairman.
The following resolution was offered
bv Dr Gibbes:
*
Resolved, That the premiums of the
Society are open for the competition of citizens
of the State who are not members
of the Society.
After some discussion, Col. Allston
moved that the following words be added
to the resolution:
"By their paying an entrance foe of
one year's subscription to the Society,"?
which was agreed to, and the resolution adopted
as amended.

From the Northern Farmer.
obstacles to the diffusion of agri- j
cultural science.
Messrs Editors : An opinion prevails
to a "mat extent anion" fanners, that
n n '
success in agricultural pursuits depends
more on the number of acres cultivated,
than 011 the science and skill of the cultivator;
more on tiie amount of labor bestowed,
tlmn on the skill with which it is
applied.
This opinion might have been just, fifty
year.i ago, in some sections of INew l^ng-1
land (so far as respected the immediate
profiisof cultivation,) when the lands were
new and unexhausted of tliose principles
of fertility, which had been accumulating
for thousands of years, by the decomposition
of vegetable matter ; but such opinions
now, in their effects, must be ruinous
to the country, as they form the most insurmountable
obstacle to the diffusion of
such knowledge and practical skill, as
would enable us to restore to its original
fertility, the lands which our fathers have
exhausted by such injudicious husbandry.
It is not at all surprising that the farmer
who has been brought up under the influence
of such opinions, should still pursue
the course which his father pursued, with
such apparent success. True, he is unsuccessful,
is falling in debt, and perhaps
his farm is mortgaged; hut he attributes
his want of success, to unfavorable seasons,
misfortune, or other circumstances beyond
his control; without once stopping to reflect,
that the entire different condition of
I1145 C,rm rn/mirna nn onil.'i II V dlfthrCnt
course of cultivation. Prejudices, in favor
of old modes and old principles, shut out
all enquiry from this whole class of farmers.
Ask them, why they do not subscribe
for some one of the agricultural
papers, which arc read with so much eagerness,
by our most intelligent and successful
farmers, and thev will toll you
that their knowledge on these subjects is
already more extensive than their power
I to execute; that they possess all the skill
necessary, but that they have not the
moans of commanding the labor requisite
to make the improvements they wish.
Another important obstacle to the diffusion
of correct knowledge on agriculturo
o
al subjects, is the prevailing taste, among
farmers, as well as all other classes, for
local politics. Many of our farmers have
so much of the carc of the Commonwealth
upon their hands, that they are compelled
to neglect their own private affairs. This
is, no doubt, what is understood to be
patriotism, iu these days; but it is most
certainly bad husbandry. Ask one of
these politicians to subscribe for an agricultural
paper, and he will tell you, he is
taking, one, two, and perhaps three political
newspapers, for which he pays; and
perhaps, has two or three others sent to
him without pay. This is almost sure to

be the case with such prominent politician s of
as have neglected their own affairs, for so
the public good; or, what is precisely the pl<
same thing, for the^ooi of office-seekers, cu
This class, therefore, have neither taste dii
nor time, for improving either their farms wi
or their understanding, they me full of so
business and bustle, in settling the affairs ta!
of the nation, till some revolution of the bl<
political wheel devests them of all their pr
consequence; and then, it is too late for If
them to learn first principles, or attend to th
the more humble business of agriculture, gr
Neither of these classes can be prevail- in?
ed on to subscribe for, or read agricultur- Tl
al papers; for the one class is too wise al- dii
ready to profit by them, and the other too bl<
busy to attend to the humble science which of
Jthey teach. on
i Another obstacle to the more general mi
diffusion of this important science, is that, en
that class of our citizens, who patronize ta;
agricultural publications, and who really co
believe in their great utility in promoting bo
the best interests of the country, are too th
sparing of their influence and of their pens so
on this subject. i til
Every intelligent farmer who reads an of
agricultural publication, should feel inter- ca
est sufficient to induce him to communi- ve
rate something, once a year at least, on te
~ . 0' * .* I
this subject for publication; and he might of
also, if he would exert his influence on v
others, (and such individuals always pos- N
scss influence) furnish without much trou- at
blc to himself, one additional subscriber th
to such a paper, annually. In this way te
much might be added to the value of these th
publications, and their benefits be much pe
more widely extended. pr
The obstacles, however, of which I have pr
spoken, can never be removed, till a spir- si
it of inquiry shall be awakened among
farnieis, till they shall believe it necessary
to read and examine, as well as to labor;
nor until they are convinced that science ' E
is as necessary to success, in the pursuits
of agric ulture, as in any other business of
life. Agricola.

Tin: CATTLE SHOW. !a
- - . ? if
The exhibition of Stock tor the 1're- "
miums of the State Agricultural Society ?
of South Carolina was held in the yard of c
the rear of the Siate House on Wodnes- 'J
day last. For a commencement, we had ! .
quite a respectable show and the spirit .
which prevailed was quite cheering to the
friends of the Society. As we have here- '
tofore failed in our attempts to get up
Agricultural Societies, some doubt axisted rr
n
as to whether our present etl'ort would be ^
successful, but the most lukewarm and &
skeptical arc now convinced that our Society
will "go ahead." The spirit which *
existed on the occasoin of this our first a
exhibition is an earnest of future success,
and now we are confident that our people
will be zeelous in the good cuuse- Some vv
very fine specimens of Cattle we here pre- a'
scnted, and the few Hogs which were ex- s'
lubited attracted much notice. Thconor- ;
mous Boar of tho Woburn Stock bred by 1
Mr. Haskell, was an object of much at. ,
tention, and the beautiful form of of thx^
Berkshire Pigs gave much satisfaction.?
Several fine Chinese and Guinea Sows .
were exhibited but that species is not pop- !l<
ular in consequence of their being bad ,r
breeders a nil not attaining the size which ?
is characteristic of the others. By a reference
to the reports of the Committees n
on Premiums in the proceedings of the
society the kind of Slock, the names of the
owners will be seen. 11
We regret there were so few of the w
Cattle of pure blood and hope noxt year tc
see a larger number.
w
By a resolution of Society all persons'
contending for premiums will be required "
to present waiting pedigree in a of the ani- J
m ils exhibited.
It has also been de'erm'ne J that persons
who are not members may contend for
premiums by paying a fee of one year's
subscription to the society.

While taking a walk in Brooklyn one af- sj
ternoon last summer we went over the
garden and spacious hot-houses of Mr. ^
Perry. Among all the varieties of exotic n
plants a ndshrubs nothing stood so grandly jt
luxuriant as the banana tree for whose ^
accommodation a hot-house of unusual \
dimensions had been prepared. Yester- Vj
day we were complimented by the owner t(
with a cluster composed of three bananas
of delicious flavor and more
-t ,i
noble in their appearance tnan mose _
grown in the tropics. The present was r
accompanied by the sollowing note: ^
Dear Sir : when at mv place during the ^
summer you may remember to have seen jj
conspicious from its heighth and foliage, y
tlie Banana Tree at th^time just giving g
signs of forth coming fruit. The accoin- .i
panying fruit ripened on the tree, and was
plucked yesterday. i beg you to accept
and try the flavour thereof. The plant jj
from which the fruit was gathered is a- ^
bout twenty-six feet high and the leaves I
about four feet wvic and twelve feet long !

vegetable matter contained in common a
ils,within the depth to wiiich it is usually bl
jwed, or six inches. It has been cal- u
lated that every acre of ground exclu- ti

thin a depth of six inches. Common :I
contain from 8 to 12 percent of vege.

we take the medium often per cent as

le fertility of soils is not so much depentig
on the whole quantity of the vegeta- ^

Tne Woburn hogs are of great length, c
rge sound in the body, legs of medium *
ngth, (the hind legs generally a little I r
nger than fore legs,) well tapered to the *
)ot?stand well and straight upon the a
>ot. The head is small for the size of
ic hog, with small ears, generally erect, <
tough many of them have their ears to
roop a little. The prevailing color is
>otted with white and black ; many are ,
rown and black. They come early to
mturitv. fVittpn ensilv. travel well, are
roductivein pigs if not kept too fat? |
entle and well disposed, nor disposed to i
e restless, or to get out of enclosures
here they are put. I have never known
Woburn sow to eat her pigs. j
I could give you a great number of exaordinary
weights; but whore great
eights have been obtained, it has generlly
been by extra keep and attention, and j
jch instances are calculated to deceive r
lose who read them. The heaviest hog J
have had of this breed was a boar thai (
>ok the premium at Lexington, in 19137,
lat weighed 500 lbs. at fifteen months ,
Id. He had three months extra keep, t
lc died at sixteen months old, and I be- '
eve would have weighed 600 lbs., hav- {
ig gained about 100 lbs. a month for the t
.st two months of his life. 1 have known (
ut one sow killed, and she weighed nett (
icat, 464 lbs. i
I killed last fall about fifteen thousand (
eight of pork, most of which were pigs t
oin six to eight months old. Two that J
ere pigged the 23 J of April, were killed
n the 12th.of December, and weighed ,
37 and 224 lbs. nett meat. Those two |
ere from a litter often, that the sow had
lised, eight of which had been selected t
>r breeders. My June pigs, killed at the \
ime time, averaged 124 lb?. Thess are r
ot given as extraordinary weights, but as
nnples of what this stock will do in thi l
ands of any body that will take proper j
ire of them. Their bodies to the ap- t
car to be perfectly round, but m?asure- j
lent shews they are rather deepest from
le back to the breast. I
Besides the Woburn, I have the Berk- }
lire, (black and white) the Neapolitan, j
ic Lancashire, the Irish, and have had j
lost of the popular breeds. I have made <
lany experiments to test the relative va i
le of the different breeds, some of which j
ave been detailed in the Franklin Farmer, j
ly experiments have not been sufficiently j
araied and exact to prove all that I wished j
> know concerning them but as far ss j
icy have gone, they have decidedly i
l favor of the Woburn. I have also proosed
in the Franklin Farmer, making a
nore thorough test of the different hogs. "

I have Berkshires of Haws' and Loss- j
lg's importation, a description of which \
as been published in many agricultural ]
apers.
I sent last year on order to England for
>ur of the best hogs that could be procujd
and my agent sent me the White i
lerkshire, the Neapolitan, the Lancashire, ]

the premium boar.
Columbia, November 25, 1840.
The boar, Sam, for which the premium of
le Sou'h Carolina Agricultural Society wfs
warded to-day to Mr. William E. Haekelt of
>t. Matthews Parish, is of the very sc. >rc?t
tut deservedly celnbraded Bedford stock.?*
)f the origin of this unequalled stock little is
nown. Tradition says that it was made
y the Duke of Bedford, by a cross between
>e VVoburn and China Hogs, and that the
tock now in America sprung from a pair of
igs which that nobleman sent as a preset.t to
r?m. Washington, but which never fulfilled
leir destination. The stock now in feouth
Carolina, is all from a pair of pigs of a

zeigh 230. lbs. He was fed on trial 7
lays, and gained in that time 30 lbs. Such
ncrease was thought dangerous to his
lealth, and his daily allowance of food
vas diminished. He gained regularly 20
bs. for many weeks in succession, until
ie was 17 months old, when he weighed
tl5 lbs. after which he could not be coneniently
weighed. If this hog had been

vhich they have in all instances been
