the value af interna! quiet, and hdvo conssqaentYy

rumstanccs have existed, and events have
occurred, peculiarly calculated to enlist the
sympathies of our People; the effort of the
Government has been foltfckupon that dispute,
nfso, with the same rigid impartiality
with which it has regarded all other Mexican
commotions.
In determining with respect to the independence
of other countries, the United
States have never taken the question of
ight between the contending parlies into
consideration. They have deemed it a
lictatc of du'y and policy to decide upon
ho question as one of fact merely.?

of a collision of interests arising,
imong other causes, from the alleged supe.
ior aptitude of the climate and s >il of Texis
for the growth of some of the staples of
he United States was not overlooked. A
ease of duty and a reverence for consistency,
however, it was considered, lelt this
Government no alternative, and it therc?
ore led the way in recognising Texas. A
lope was certainly eutertained that this act
md the motives that conduced to if, even if

neot would enter upon the execution of the j
mentions intimated by its envoy extraordi. j
lary, with respect to connexions with for- ;
ign Powers, with a full understanding of j
he just and liberal commercial stipulations
fisting between the United States and
>thcr nations. A pervading princi?le
of those compac s is impartial
reatment of the citizens, vessels, and- proactions
of tho parlies in their respective
srriiorfes. As it was not to be believed
:iat the commercial allies of the United
halts would 8wervo from their engagements,
no apprehension was felt that the injres.sof
th.s country would suffer from the
rrangements which Texas might enter into
nth them.
The question of the annexation of a forigu
independent State 10 the United State*
S8 never before been presented to th s
xevernment. Since tho adoption of their
onsthuiion, two large additions have been
undo to the domain originally claimed by
je United States. In acquiring them, this
Government was not actuated by a mere
liirst for sway over a broader space.?
Paramount interests of many members of
bo Confederacy, and the permanent well
eing of ail, imperatively urged upon this
Government the necessity of an extension
f its jurisdiction over Lou.sioua and Fioria.
As peace, however, was our clierish.
d policy, never to bo departed from unless
onor should be periled by. adhering to it,
re patiently endured lor a time serious in.
onvenienccs and privations, and sought a
ransfer of those regions tjy negotiations
nd not by can quest. ,
The issue of those negotiations was a con.
ilional cession of these countries to the
Jailed States. The circumstance, howevr,
of their being colonial possessions of
Vance and Spain, and therefore dependent
n the metropolitan Governments, renders
mso transactions materially different from
tat which would be presented by the ques
sons of the annexaution of Texas. The
ittsr is a State wi;h an independent Govrnmenr,
actio wledgcd as such by the Uniai
States, and claiming a teritory, beyond
oough bordering on the region ceded by
Vance, in the Treaty of the 30ih of April
803. Whether the Constitution of the
Jnited States contemplated the annexation
if such a State, and if so, in what n anner
hat object is to be| effected, are questions,
fi the opinion of the President, it would be
uexyedient, under existiug circumstances,
0 agitate.
So long as Texas shall remain at war,
vhile the United States are at peace with
ter adversary, the proposition of the Texan
niuister plenipotentiary necessarily involves
he question of war with that adversary.
The United States aro bound to Mexico by
1 ireaty of aimity and commerce, which
vill be scrupulously observed on their part,
x> long as it can be reasonably hoped that
M-iico will perform her duties

The inducements mentioned by General
