EDITORS' CORRESPONDENCE.

IN EW 10RK, AUGUST -S-Z.
I have for a day or twopast been searching all
ihe newspapers from all sections of the country
to gain something like correct information
in regard to the prcrent and future crops.?
The papers, with here and there an exception
are unanimous in saying there will he an
abundant harvest. In Maine the crops will
be larger than they have been for many years
and the wheat crop there will be larger than
ever before, and in all probability the bounty
promised by the State will cost the State not
less than from three to four thousand dollars.
The bounty is 10 cents per bushel upon all
over 40 bushels which any one farmer may
raise. In some parts of the State 25 and 30
acres have been sown, which will yield in many
parts of the State from 25 to 30 bushels
to the acre. Last year Maine laid out more
Than 820,000 for flour; this year she will raise
enough to supply her entire home comsump
tion. The crops in all the* New England
States? are equally good with those in Maine.
In Canida they are also good, and pospects
of the season there were never more promisinnr
than thev are at present; so also with the
-o
crops in most parts ot our own State and in
Pennsylvania. The Western farmers make
few complaints and few arc heard from the
South. ;

New York, Aug. 23.
For the first time.for some days I have today
taken a stroll through the business streets
of the city, and glad I am to inform you that
there is a stricking contrast between the appearance
of things to-day and a week or t wc
"since. Some ot our stores begin to look like
things of life. Our side walks are covered
with bales, boxes, and bags of goods.. Our
cartmen, mechanics, and laborers are shortening
thou* faces in anticipation of better times,
and the city m many places "and for manyreasons
gives chering promises of a change ol
of things for the better. The contrast, mind
you, has reference only to the dull, quiet and
lifeless monotony of our city, which has ap
peareii every where for Uic Jast lew monms,
and the appearance of thing?;'at the present
fnomont.

The Liverpool paper gives only a brief sum
mary of the Parliamentary proceedings, ante.
cedent to the prorogation. The punishineut
of death bill, the bill of exchange bill,' and the
criminal law bill (restricting the number or
crimes punished capitally.) were passed in
the House of Lords^ with several others.
Monday, July 10.
Nothing could exceed the interest excited
by tiie announcement, that the t^ueen wouiu
this day prorogue Parliament in person. At
an early liour, all tbe avenues leading to the
gallarics of the House of Lords were crowded
with ladies, anxiously w'ailingthe hour for admission,
which was fixed for twelve o'clock.?
Punctually at that time (the judicial bussiness
of the House having terminated,) the doors
were opened for those having-tickets to the
strangers' gallery, which, with the exception
of the reporters bench, was exclusively approbated
to peers' daughters and other ladies.
In a few. minutes the gallery was-complctely
crowded.
In the body of the house most of the seats
were ticketed with the names of Peeresses
who intended to be present, after the manner
of the House of Commons when a heavy debate
is expected, and in the course of an hour about
a hundred had arrived. The ladies were all
attired in deep mourning, with black feathers
which, contrasted with the state robes of the
Peers, *and the brilliant costumes of the foreign
ministers and ainbassadois, gave to the House
a very peculiar and striking appearance.
At half past one there was scarcely a seat
unoccupied, and thespaeerailed off bwiind the
the episcopal bench, for the accommodation of
foreign ministers, tyeing found insufficient, for
that purpose, several obtained seats in the
jieer's gallery, on the right of the throne.' I n the
left hand gallery we observed Earl Grev, and
the Earl of Durahm and his family. The Earl

foreign ambassadors.
The throne and footstool (both of which
were covered with rich crimsom velvet; ap]>eared
to be new; but in other "respects ik
" change was made. The old canopy remainec
and the initials,"G. R " behind the throne wen
unaltered.
Precisely at twenty minutes to three o'clock
her Majesty, proceeded by the heralds? am
lords waiting, and attended by great officer:
of state?the Lord Chancellor carrying tin
cap of maintenance, the Duke of Somerso
bearing the crown upon a cushion, and Lon
* Melbourne holding the sword of state?enter
ed the House. The peers and peeresses ros<
as her majesty entered, and continued stand
ing.
The ladies in wait inn, and the pages, win
bore her majesty's train, took their places oe
hind the tiirone. The Lord Chancellor, th<
Marquis of Landsdowne, Viscount Duncannon
and the Duke of Norfolk, stood on the steps o
the throne, to the right of her majesty, and or
" the left stood Viscount Melbourne, the Duk(
of Somerset, and the Duke of Sussex.
Her majesty was splendidly attired. Beneath
a mantle and train of the richest crimsor
she wore a robe of white satin wrought wit I
gold; a circlet of diamonds glittered on hei
brow; the blue riband of the order of the gartn
crossed her bosom and fastened on the left s .e
a profussion of large and costly diamonds hun?
upon her neck.
Her majesty ascended the Throne with a
firm and composed step, and for several moments
continued standing, graciously regarding
all around her.
At this moment the interest of the scene
was at its height; and the spectacle of sc
young and beautiful a Sovereign so surrounded
and deporting herself in a situation so new,
with an easy dignity and natural grace that
could not be surpassed, was a sight not soon
to be forgotten. On taking her seat her Ma.
lesty'u countenance became slightlv flushed;
?* ind PIT*1 mv onkirjg round uer, seeing that
51 the Peers remained standing, she said in a low
! I tone of voice, but bending gracefully forward,
and with an easy gesture of the hand, "My
i I Lords, be seated."
, ; Sir Augustus Clifford,the Usher ofthe Black
t Rod, was then directed to summon, the Coin>;
inons, and in a few minutes the Members of
I the House headed by'the Speaker, appeared
? i before the bar. The turbulent mode of their
, entrance, and the almost boisterous struggle
t for precedence that look place between some
I of them, appeared to afford her Majesty much
amusement. She smiled, and looked quickly
i Tound at the Lords who stood near the Throne.
. After a short pause.
The Speaker addressed her Majesty after
' assuring her majesty that the commons participated
in that strong and universal of dutiful
and affectionate attachment to her majesty's
person &c. he referred to different acts pas)
sed by the commons.
I Her Majesty then read, in a clear and unI
faltering tone, and with an unequalled sweet!
i ness of voice, the following most gracious
.j fpeeeh:
, " My Lords and Gentleman,
" I have been anxions to" seize the first op.
[ portunitv of meeting1 you, in order that I might :
. repeat in person my cordial thanks for your
: condolence upon the death of his late Majesty,
| aiid for the expressions of attachment and
; affection with which you congratulated me upon
my accession to the throne. I am very desi.
rous of renewing the assurance of my determination
to maintain the Protestant religion, as
\ established by law : so secure to all the free
exercise of the rights of conscience ; to protect
. the liberties and to promote the welfare of all
, classes of the community.
I rejoice that in ascending the throne, I find
, the country in amity with all foreign powers;
and while I faithfully perform the engagements
of the crown, and carefully watch-over the in:
terests of my subjects, it shall be the constant!
, object of my solicitude to maintain the hies- ,
sings of peace. - *
i 44 Gentlemen of (he House of Commons: I
. "I thank you for the liberal supplies which
. | you have granted for the public service of the |
year, as well as the provision you have made
' to meet the payments usually chargeable upon
. 1 the civil list. ^
I 4-1 will give directions that the public expenditure,
m all its branches, be administered
; with the strictest economy.
44 My Lords and Gtnllemen:
44 In taking leave of this Parliament, I re*
-i l - r? .1 1 1
;! turn you my inanns wr me zudi duu a?Muuu>
(i with which you have applied yourselves to the
public business of the country,
i " Although your labors have beer, unexpec.
tedly inter-upted, by the melancholy event
I which has taken place, I trust that they will
i have the beneficial effect of advancing the proj
gress of legislation in a new Parliament. I
perceive with satisfaction that you have
. brought to maturity some useful measures,
f 'among which.I regard with peculiar interest
I the amendment of the criminal code, and the
II reduction of the number of capital punishments.
I hail this mitigation of the severiry of the law
as an auspicious commencement of my reign.
" I ascend the throne wjth a deep sense of
the responsibility\vhich is imposed upon me;
?I but I am supported by tne consciousness of my
j own right intentions, and by my dependence
j upon the protection of Almighty God. It will
I be my care to strengthen our institutions, civil"
j and ecclesiastical, by discreet improvement
! wherever imnrovement is reauirOd, and to do
all in my power to compose and allay animosity-and
discord. '
" Acting upon these.principles, I shall upon
all" occasions, look with confidence to the wisdom
of Parliament and the aftcc'.ions of my*
I people, which form the true Support of thedig*
nity of the crown, and insure the stability of the
I constitution "
A hum of admiration, that almost theratenj
ed to burst into a cheer, ran round the House
[ as her Majesty closed the speech.
.[ The Lord Chancellor then said?It is her
i Majesty's royal will and pleasure that this Parj
liament be prorogued to Thursday, the l()th
I day of August next; and this Parliament isac
cordingly prorogued to Thursday, the 10th day
of August next.
! Immediately after this announcement her
I Majesty descended the Throne, and quitted
the House m the same order as she had entered, j
except that she was now followed by.the Duch-;
ess of Kent.
J Thp nrorision and clearness of the Queen's i
; j enunciation in reading the speech from the
throne are much praised in the journals, as well.
> as her ' dignity, grace aud self-possession"
; throughout the proceedings. On entering the
I royal robing room, however, after leaving the
i j House of Peers, she fainted, but was soonre
j covered by proper-restoratives. . *
i The London papers have much to say, of
; course, upon the Queen's speech, and both pnr,
ties claim it as favorable to their views respectively?the
whigs confidently, and the conseri
vatives as men who would believe it if they
f could.
: The indications that the royal favor is it to
be bestowed decidedly upon t^e whigs, appear
i to be almost beyond question.

Morr news from Spain.?By the steam
ship Cuba, from Havana. Dates from Cadiz
1 to 2d July.
' By a letter direct from Cadiz, furnished us
I by Mr. Win. Kidd, of the Merchants' Ex,
change, it is stated that the commercial treaty
between England and Spain, of which there
has been so much talk, has at last been rati|
fied; nevertheless, the British cabinet endeav.
\ ors to keep it a secret, as regards France,;
, whose interest by it is greatly affected.
t The statement that Don Carlos was made
j a prisoner, &c. is all unfounded. It appears,
beyond doubt, that one of the principal rea;
sons Don Carjos had for going into Catalonia,
] is that of placing himself in apisition of bei
ing able to receive the assistance promised to
him by Sardinia and Italy. The British Cab5
inet has conceived the same idea, and it is be
lieved that should it prove that the Cabinet of
? Turin, upon which the greatest suspicion
, rests, should pass arms, ammunition, or money
f to Don Carlos, England would intervene in
i the affairs of Spain, more efficaciously than
? heretofore. It is asserted that Lord Palmerston

point.?Picayune.

The Crops, in the upper country, nevei
presented a fairer prospect for an unusual Har

Wheat has turned out bettor, and produced ?
larger amount to the quantity sown, than ii
has before for many years ; and such appear
to be the case throughout the United States
The Com crop bids fair to amply repay the
farmer for his toil?in fact, it has seldom look

thing that the earth produces, for our beneti

On Saturday last, about 11 o'clock, A. M.
Mr. Marcus L# Hoke, of Lincolnton, N. C,
was murdered in the street, a few steps lrorr
his own door, by Lo^an Henderson. Hoh(
i was the third son of Col. John Hoke; Hen
' /lore , ic tlio smi of \f?i. Henderson, the form
er Clerk of the Superior Court of Lincoli
County. The following is the account giver
of particulars by our informant S?
" Maj. Henderson has been trying for some
time to pick a quarrel with Hoke, for taking
an active haqd in the election of John Michae
as Clerk of the Court, in place of 13. S. John,
son; and yesterday, (19th inst:) attacked agair
at M. VV. Albemathy's office, and got to abusing
Col. John Hoke. Marcus was unable U
hear his father abused without replying to ok
Major Henderson in rough language. Some
person went up street and told Logan II. thai
i Hoke had abused his father. Having returned
but a few weeks from Texas, Hendcrsor
was prepared with Bowie Knife, &c. When
he heard that Hoke had abused his father
j he told some persons that he would give him
a thrashing. This was in Mr. Motz's store.
He then started down to Hoke's store, and
saw Iloke coming from towards the offices, on
j his own lot, a few steps from his store. Hoke
[ was by himself. Henderson called Hoke tc
| him, and when near enough, struck him over
the head with his stick, sprung back two 01
three steps, drew his Bowie Knife, and sprung
on him again, put it into his left side, seized
j him, and was attempting finish him on the
[spot, before any one saw him. Maj. Michael
i and F. A. Hoke were in the Barber's shop on
i the same lot, but saw nothing of it until the
other two had scuffled to nearly the middle ol
the street. Michael and Hoke parted them,
This was about 11 o'clock, A. M. and Hoke
expired at 12 that, night."

NE \V.ORLEANS, August 25,
By the schooner Helen from Galveston,*ared
yesterday we learn that on the 11th, day
ore her departure schooner, Ehza Russel
1 arrived at that port from the Alacranes, !
charge of a prize crew, she having been tak- \
by tlie Texian schooner of war Brutus, offi
al, The vessel was English, but was caped
as containing Mexican property,
riie officer in charge of the Eliza Russeh
resents that the squarden under the comnd
of H L Thomson, had captured and sent j
o Matagorda two Mexican vessels loaded I
:h dry goods. He also stated that they had
:en a number of other vessels which had ei:r
been held to ranson, or after being gutted
heir cargo, destroyed. In addition to this,

the villages, with the'exception of Santa
ira, from Cape Catouche to Sisal. Both
i schooners were crowded witn goods taken
rrr the enemy, and all on board remained in
fh health and spi/its.' Thomson proposed
cruise a few days longer down the Camichycost,
before returning to port. It'is
: unlikely that this man may provs a second
