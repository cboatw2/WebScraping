BANK OF CAMDEN.
We congratulate our citizens generally, and
particularly our Cotton growing neighbors, on the
certainty of the establishment of tins institution.
Its influence has clrtady been fell, so tnnch so,
that town property has oa mspieicn, risen from 15
to 90 per cent within a few weeks, and il wc may
judge from the "roicing appearance of some of oar
Mercantile nouses on oruau miriri, n uiim-?ot
certain ibat our merchants will be supplied the ensuing
season with as large an assortment of Iran
nctc goods as tbfjr will b with bran' new money.
We therefore earnestly solicit our Cotton giou-iug
friends to look well to their interest, and give our
merchants an early opportunity of proving to them
what can now be done in Caindrn.
Strange indeed as it may appear, yet it is equally
true, that from observation* lately made by some
of the most rigiimnt Astronomers of our town, it
has been ascertained beyond a doubt that we will
have no 4l& of July in Camden this year. Tins
will in fact be a raving of one day, particularly to
those who don't know hotr to spend it
At the Swimming Pens in Claremont county, on
Saturday, the 15th instant, Dr. J. itmior, Gro. L.
Cnanrios. Jons Bhadlst, Hnntw James, J. P
Rjcuabdros, F. L. KtNsr.pt, Sakcvl M'Er.iur.
and Jons Rimsat were appointed delegates to Ibe
knoiTtiir convention.
We are pleased to find the name of George L.
Cuaxrtoji among the above named delegate*. !!c
it withouLdoubt more conversant with the subject
of Rail Roads than any other individual tic know
of, and may be justly styled the fttfJirr of the ays
tcm in this country. He ir&s lite author of a acnes
of essays published more than twenty year* ago in
the Richmond Enquirer on this subject; and all
those who bare been ocqoamtrd with bnn from that
time, know that it has been bis chief LoUv??->
much no, that lie has been fr< qarutiy vpoken of ci
Rail Rood mad, end was reviled and laughed at by
the men who air note the most tkorov%A
Cor the system.
The editor of the Newborn Spectator in remarking
on the duel which lately took place between
Mr, Braes of N. C. and Mr. Jturan, of Md says ;
" Should Braes ever again muster courage towrei
another lihite man sc the field be will labor under
A disadvantage." We think not, unit-ax the seconds
should be so ixctmsidtrale as lo nb/tilxU Uai far
read.
(I will be recollected an article has ~anc the
-rounds of the newspapers stating a u fia" ?a on
foot to deprive Gen. IIocstov of the command ef
the Texian army, and place Geo. Jswra Hskiltos
of this state, at its head, and that if 6*en. liswitro*
should sneered to the cocnna-?d. $10,000,000 would
be pledged lo the support of the cause of Texiao Independence.
By a paragraph in to-day's paper, it
will be area, that Gem flauti.ro* as a brave and
honorable man,h**tL-nird tb?r agency of any "plot"

upon the orucr of Gen. Rusk. It <!? ?
nccm to us, that after the massacre ol tli
Mexicans, on the til at of April, by th
victorious American Tcxiana, it votih
be discreet for their officer* to say o* ! '
tic as possible of Mexican cruelties. 'I Iannals
of sata^e war do not furnish
More bloody parage of history than nil
be recorded of that battle. By their owl
accounts, hundreds upon hundreds ?j
flying unarmed Mexicans were shot dow
while imploring for mercy. When th
ammunition of the Tcxians failed, the
knocked the fugitires in the head wit
their rifle-butts. Hundreds more fled t
the river, and, when standing unarmct
harmless and helpless?unable cilber to
resist or to fiy?their heads only above
water, were shot down as remorselessly
by the victors as though they had been so
many jackails. In view of these facts,
therefore, we would suggest that, on the
score of massacres, the least said by the
disinterested Texian patriots the better/*
FRENCH CLAIMS.
The New York Journal of Commerce
of Thursday says:?"Yesterday, nftcr so
many years of hope deferred, the holders
1 of certificates for claims allowed on ac|
count of the French spoliations, had the
(pleasure of receiving about 50 per cent.
| on the amount, comprising an aggregate
] of near 2,500,000. As most of the clai;
inants reside in the Northern cities, the
| effect upon the money market in these
, places must be very perceptible, by putting
into circulation, funds which have
hitherto beru locked up in deposit? banks
j To this cause, partly, is to bo attributed,
i we presume-, the relief experienced in our
i money market yesterday. The operations
of the United Stales Bank doubtless
contributed to the same result."
i Duel between Messrs. Jenifer and lit]num.
The difficulty that occurred in the House
of Representatives, on Thursday night between
Mr. Jenifer, of Md. and Mr. Bynum,
of N. C. w as, it seems, of such a nature, as
j to call for a demand of (icrsonai satisfaction
The par ies met at Kock Creek, near
Washington, accompanied by their respective
frit-nds. The d;.-nucc selected was ten yards
or thirty feet. After six ineffectual fires, uc
understand Mi. Bynum came forward in the
most honorable manner and expressed himself
in terms, which at once settled the diffi*
( cultv.
The details of this duel will probably be
given, at length, by the mutual friends of the
i parties.
I Mr. Jenifer tvas accompanied by Mr. Peyton
and Mr. Pickens; Mr. Bynuin by Mr.

far remote from all local causes of disease.
