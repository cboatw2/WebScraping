WHEAT CULTURE.
of all the crop- cultivated in the north
eru or middle parts of the United State-,
the crop. par excellence, is unquestionabi%
wheat, Its intrinsic value as ain article of
food, its importance us on item of expori,
it, infliuence ou trade, and its vast sway im
regulating the exchanges and commerce of
the world. reiders it every where a crop
of the greatest consequence, and particu
larly so in this country, To raise goidt
wheat many things must he kept in view;
the nature and texture of tie soil-its qiual
ity. so far as richness or poverty is con
cerned-the kind of wheat most suitable
far cultivation undter time circumstances of
the case-ilie clean liness and preparation
of the seed-thu titme and inethod of sow
ing-and in short all the tiings that go to
ameliorate mhe soil and secure a crop,
must be attended to, rendering the grow
ing of wheat one of the most arduous as
well as profitable occupations of the far
mer.
A good wheat soil always contains con
siderable clay, but it is Fo balanced nod
corrected by other ingredients as never to
be cold and sour; if such is time character
of any soil, good wheat need not he ex
pceted. Freedom from superfaious mnois
lture ir stagnant water, is anm inldislpensible
condition of a cood wheat soil; and when
such exemption does not naturally exist,
it must be produced by draining. A moist
cool clitnate is found not to be unfavorable
to wheat, if the roots are preserved from
stagnant water, and are allowed to range
in a previous soil; but in any climate wheat
will fail where tihe soil is saturated with
water that does not circulate. To give
the requisite dryness and depth where they
do not exit, draining and deep plowing
may be relied upon and w here these go
together, with proper manurimg a soil can
scarcely fail to improve, or to beo produc
live.
Deep plowing, on most lands as they
natmally are, amid ott all lands as they
should be made, is essential to good wheat
crops. Time roots of this plant penetrate
in a permeuble soil to a great depth, and
spread to a considerable distance. The'
single fact of its being provided with two
sets of roots. one of which spreads near the
surlface, and the other strikes deeply, is a
suflicient pronofr the necessitv which ex
ists for deep plowing its clmue. In a few
instances sulbsoils mnay he found which
will nor admit ofdeep plowiig, heingcom
posed of materials injttrionts to time wheat
crop ; but great cropi of wheat are not to
be expected on sich soils.
The application of manures is a very
essetial point in growing time wheat crop.
Land can be too rich, as well as too potr
for wheat, or rather tie manure in the soil
may lie in that condition which render it
unsuitable for wheat. Th'ere are some
crops on which fresh or unfermented ma
nure exercises a good effect, and to which
it can scarcely be applied in too large
quantities, corn for inance; while oi the
others they produice results of the most ot
favorable kin'l. Nearly all the cerealuse
arel, injur(d by fredh mantires. the stalk
growiui too vigorous. while tho herry is
usually imperfect. Comupost mannire, or
such as are made by layers of turf. stable
manure, vegetable mould, lime, &c. in
which the decomposition is already effected
cant scarcely be applied too abundantly to
land otherwise well coustimuted. The
great crops obtained around iold barns, or
other decayed oor removed buildinmgs. is a
proof that largev quaimit ies of decomiosei
manture maty safely be used. wvhile a miuchm
less quantimy mtf tfreshm or unidecompotsed

There is a practice wihich has prevailed
to a consiiderahle extenit itt our wheat pro
ducing districts: of. growing wheat after'
w~heat several times in succession. Such
a system of farmting deserves thme severest
reprehtension, and will never' lie adopted,
except by those who are itt haste to lie
rich.n ma tter at wham price, and in defi
ance of acknowledged conisequences. Far

cease to yield good crops, where their first
cultivation proved the adaption of the soil
to that particular one. The worn out and
exhauxted soils ofNew-England can he
mude to produce as good aid as plentiful
crops of wheat as they formerly did, but
the labor and cost of restoring would be
itlinit!ly more than would have been re
quired to have kept thei continudlly ler

fic food. which may be more or less pletit
ful in a soil, and without which they cannot
be btought to perfection. Take for in

Ie wise then, where it exists, to prevetit
its decrease or its exhaustion.
It is unhappily too true, that on a larg
portion o our best cultivated wheat lauds,
the soil has become so infested with a va
riety of foul and noxious plants, that a
course of naked suminier fallow, thorough
ly perfrormed, has become necessury to
counteract them, and prevent their itcreas
and spread. On clean soils this wou ll not
he required, hut somne valuable ciopt mithi
take its place. and thus add essentially to
the profits, while it lessons the labtr of the
of the husbandttan. so far asjthe- operation
of sttmner plowing was concerned. The
onily alternative of such fitllows is hoed
crops, and these must ofnecessity for the
reasons before given. be too litnited, to
seriously ef.ect the propriety of fallows on
weedy land. Spring crops, such as bare
lv, oats, spring wheai, or even peas, do not
allow ofsullieient culivation to check tle
bpread of weeds. The sowing of such
crops ott land where the canada listle for
instance aboutnds, is precisely he treal
ment to Make it spread and flourish. The
thi-tle. stein krout, rharlock. &c., will sae
cumb ntly to plowints anti hoeings so oft
repeated that the tmttilated plant has no
titne to recover frotn one blow before an
other is given.
The preparntion of scet, and the quali
ty of that sown, are obtjects of she greatest
consequence. It the most favord stec
tions of ottr country there are but few
fields of wheat in which stiut cannot ie
detected, and in a cotmutry so favorable to
the perfection and purity of this grain, as
the best wheat districts in the U. States
are, none at all shnuld be suffered. In
Europe, continual care is requisite to keep
lteir wheat free, and in the iest wheat
countries the crop is altnost wholly exempt
from smut. here but a trifling attention is
requisite, & the consequence is, it is fotind
aitnost every where, ant in some places
to the cerious injtry of the crop. Now it
is well understood, that soaking or wash
ittg wheat in brine, anl drying it wit h caus
tic slacked lime, will elfecrally prevent
smut, as well as benefit the crop it othtr
respeets; t sow wheat therefore. without
suci preparation is voltitarily to incur
the risk ofsmutted wheat, and the ittevir
able consequent loss. There are some
other stbstances that used as a wash for
wheat appear to possess the power of de
stroying stnut, such as copperas, vitriol. ar
senic, &r-., hut as nottc are more certain it
their operation, or enn be used with les
trouble or danger than lime, the applica
ion of that substance is undoubtedly to I
preferred tonny other.
The kind of seed used, and its quality,
are thing of tot) ttutch cousequen-ce in the
ulture of wheat to le left to chane.
There are ttany varieties of wheat cult

seem to thittk that any thing that is itt thne
shape of wheat, howevetr itmperfect or de
ficetive the berry, if it niill ontlygt ow, may
be used as seetd. Thtis is very mistakett
policy, it is itmpossible thtat the young
plant should lbe as sigorotts atid as perfect,
wh-len sptritngirtg from defective and shrunk
en seed, as when growitig from thtat in
which the peculiar prtincipiles of the plant
are fully developetd, atnd the get-intation
comnmetnces without check otr htidt-atnce.
The seed tat ripens first itn the ear, anti is
seperatetd with thne gtreattest ease, is the
most prnoper for seetd, as thtese circutstan
es show it is the most ttature. A far
mner in one oif the northtern stares, a few
years sitnce was itt the htabit oif sellitng large
riuatntities of seed wheat annutally antI at
high prices, as his whteat was of sttperior
quality, very heavy, andi productive, and
stpposed to lbe a nesw varity. It ap
pearedl, hoawever, that he had brought his
wheat to that degree of perfection, bty se
lecting sotme of the finest ears fromt a field
in the fit-st place, atid then instead of thresh
ingthe whole crop growtt atit using the
sted promiscuotusly, he gently beat thte
sheaves over a barrel, by which only the
best anti most perfect grains were cepera
ted, and by repeatetd sowiOn hand rentderetd
the qtualities so desirable permanent. Thte
quiatity of seed sown differs tmuch in dif
fetent parts of this country and in Europe,
Perhaps the English ttse a greater amoutt
of seed titan atny other people, andI their
crops are certainly not ofteti exeelled.
F'romt two atnd a htalf to fotur bushels pet
acre are there used; while htet-e the quanti
ty varies from tone to two atid a htalfhusht
els per acre. The getneral itnatity is a
out a bushel anti a half. Where wheat
is stown late, more seed is requnitred, as thne
wheat dotes not tiller or spreatd as much ;ts
wheti stiwn early; and when thte hterry is
unnusnlly plump amd fulimorn is eqn'i,.
ed than when the kernel is lighter. As on
soils too, that are not rich, a single plant
will not throw out as many stalks as
where the land is very rich and fertile, it
would seem that on such lands more seed
would lie necessary to seed it properly, i
it is elear that where bIut one or two staIk.s
,Aoot from a root, these must lie were nn
merous than when a rout proluees half a
lozen.
Opinions among fatrmers have been
somewhat variant on the sujPect ofehalig
tog seed; but we think unless more paili
is take'n to originate and preserve good
oi a fItrn, than now Isually is, there is es
sential hen-fit derived from such chances.
Wheat is certain to succeed better on lands
not naturally alapted to its prodietion,
when the seed is brought from a good
wheat soil or district. For many years
the farmers of large sections of tho we
tern districts of New York, where the'
wheat crop at that lime was ilit to fail or
imn t, hu11 n proli inl sending somne twen
iv tr forty miles it procire seed 'from the
best grain districts, and the crop from such
wheat rarely failed in producing graitn of
good quality. There is also a deeided lid
vantage secured in brinigig seed from
lower lands and a milder clim ie, to cI
vated latids, or a cold moist elimate. Such
a change of seed renders the mountain
crp eat lier and hetter than it would he it
seed from the same neighborhood wa,
usee. Professor Brown has otn this sub
ject the following remarks. which are un
doubtedly correct. as they aire foinded ont
the experience of) ibha 'll 1tdm en in the high
and lww land-i ot Scotland:
"We are convined that the cultivator
of a nontitnoos district, if he alwav
used seed from his own crops, would reap
later and later htarvests, so that at last
they would with, dillicnlty be brought two
maturity; a circumstnce easily explained
by the coiparative shortness of sumner
in mountain distriets. If, ot the other
hand. the cultivator of a flat country, the
climate of which i-, mil. and tit'e soil dry
and light, cointiually made use of hi,
own seen, it would head every year soot.
er, the stalks would liecome shorter, and
the heads aid grain smaller. aind in titmwe
there would result but a poor produce, in
this last ease, the cuhlivator brings his seed
with adlvantage from a country or districi
more cold. the soil of which is good and
submtantial."
The instances in which hentit has beeti
derived. (onl whar are called beerbi und wm
ple laids. iy tsing seed from oak lands.
are so numerons that almost every one
must hie familiar with them. The al
vantages to this ease, however we mway
choose toexplain diem. cannot with pro
priety lie di1iptmed.
As to the time of sowing wheat, it may
be remarked, that very early sown %% heat
gets more firmly rooted, than lier sown.
and it conseqinence is less liable to injury
from freezing outt. Vheat nia he sown

Mr. Il'ebster's opinions.--It will puzzle
any one, who reads the subjoined extract,
to know %% hat are the real opinions of Mr.
Webster about a National Bank, the Ta

tond in different hoitudes, Mr. Webster ex
presses disc.rdant opinions. on tite same
;ubjects. it seems, that le "fullows in the
