urgently to demand, but not involving
auy material additional expenditure; the
contractors have generally performed
thair engagements with fidelity; tlie postmasters,
with few exceptions, have tendered
their accounts and paid their quarterly
balances with promptitude; and the
whole service of the department has
maintained the effieitney for which it has
for several years been distinguished.
The acts of Congress establishing new
mail routes, and requiring more expensive
services on others, and the increasing
wants of the country, have, for three
years past, carried the expenditures something
beyond the accruing revenues; the
vexcess having been met, until the past
year, by the surplus which had previously
accumulated. That surplus having been
exhausted, and the anticipated increase
in the revenue not having been realized,
owing to the depression in the commercial
n.f ik. nnnntrtf th? finances of
UUOilirOJ Ul Irllb WVUIJ?| JI y ?
(he department exhibit a small deficiency
at the close of the last fiscal year. Its
resources, however are ample; and the
reduced rates of compensation for the
transportation service, which may be expected
on the future leltings, from the
general reduction of prices; with the increase
of revenue that may reasonably be
anticipated from the revival of commercial
activity, must soon place the finances
of the department ia a prosperous condition.
Considering the unfavorable circumstances
which have existed during the
past year, it is a gratifying result that the
revenue has not declined, as compared
with the preceding year, but on the con
trarv, exhibits a small increase; the circumstances
referred to having had no
other effect than to check the expected
income.
It will be seen that the Postmaster
General suggests certain improvements
in the establishment, designed to reduce
the weight of the mails, cheapen the
transportation, ensure greater regularity
in the service, and secure a considerable
reduction in the rates of letter-postage?
an object highly desirable. The subject
is one of general interest to the community,
and is respectfully recommended to
your consideration.
The suppression of the Afriean slave
trade has received the continued attention
of the Government The brig Dolphin
and schooner Grampus have been employed
during the late season on the coast of
Africa, for the purpose of preventing such
portions of that trade as was said to be
prosecuted under the American flag. After
cruising of those parts of the coast
- * 11 until
TOO* I usually rceuucu IU <JJ aia-viu,
the commencement of the rainy season,
these vessels returned to the United States
for supplies, and have since been despatched
on a similar service.
From the reports of the commanding
officers, it appears that the trade is now
principally carried on under Portuguese
colors; and they express the opinion that
the apprehension of their presence on the
slave coast has, in a great degree, arrested
the prostitution of the American flag,
to the inhumane purpose. It is to be hoped
that, by continuing to maintain thi6
force in that quarter, and by the cxertion-s
of the officers in command, much will be
done to put a stop to whatever portion of
this traffic may have been carried on under
the American flag, and to prevent its
use in a trade which while it violates the
laws, is equally an outrage on the rights
of others and the feelings of humanity.
The efforts of the several governments
who are anxiously seeking to suppress
this triffic must, however, be directed
pgninst the facilities afforded by what arc
now recognized as legitimate commercial
pursuits, before that object can be fully
accomplished. Supplies of provisions,

wairr cs6kb, niercnanuixr, mm
connected with the prosecuting of the
slave trade, are, it is understsod, freely
carried by vessels of different nations to
the slave factories; and the effects of the
factors are transported only from one sla^e
station to another, without inteiruption
or punishment by either of the nations to
which they belong, engaged in the commerce
of that region. I submit to your
judgements whether this Government,
having been the first to prohibit, by ade'
quale penalties, the slave trade?the first
to declare it piracy?should not be the
first, also to forbid to its citizens all trade
with the slave factories on the coast of
Africa; giving an example to all nations
in this respect, which if fairly followed,
cannot fail to produce the most effective
results in breaking up those dens of iniquity.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
A largo portion of our paper is occupied to-day
' by this excellent State paper. Wo need not ask
our readers to give it an attentive perusal, ftfr that
they will moot assuredly do, and thoy will not, ofterw&rds,
think that its place could have been better
supplied. The view which the message prerents
of our foreign relations must bo gratifying to |
every friend of his country, and especially bo, to (
thoso who have continued to sustain the administration
of our present chief magistrate, as it affords (
the highest justification of their confidence.
Our domestic affairs, if not in the most prosper- ]
ous condition are yet sufficiently so to surprise all ^
those who hate been misled by the orators and es.
sayists who havo succeeded in obtaining the power
and the patronage of the government. After a do
riod ofsuch unexampled embarrassment as the coun try
has just labored under, ever since the very commence,
ment of the presentadministration, it is truly a subject
of surprise to find that our financial condition is not t
materially worse than it is, and a matter of gratifies-,
tion that amidst the general rovulsion, the public (
faith has been preserved; no permanent public debt
has been incurred, and the amount of Troasury (
Notes unredeemed is so small. But wo need not
dwell on topics which tho message so ably diicosses. (
The President's confidence in tlio success of tho great
measure of his administration is unabated, and his ]
opposit'on to a National Bank is increased and (
strengthened.
We cannot too strongly recommend to our roa- 1
ders a careful examination of the message, on these
topics. The arguments used we think, furnish an J
ample and satisfactory vindication of the republican ,
administration, which is just going out of powor.
The Legislature of this State closed its sesion on
Friday last, or rather on Saturday morning.
ETSoveral communications ore omitted this week
for want of room.
BIBLE MEETING.
A rcspectablo number of the friends of tho general
distribution of tho Bible, assembled, on Friday
evening last, ia pursuance of previous notice, at
the Lecture Room of tho Presbyterian Church, to
boar the report of the delegates (appointed at a prior
meeting) to the Bible convention recently held at
Columbia, and to reorganise the Camden Bible So,
oiety. Mr. James K. Douglas, (who presidod at
" the former meoting) took the ohair, and J. C- West
acted as Seorotary. After an address to tho throne
i of Graco, the Rev. Samuel Towns end, one of tho
delegates to the convention, gave a general aci
count of the proceedings of that body, the object
| of which was, especially, to furnish ovory destitute
family in the State, with a copy of the Holy Scripi
turaa. The meeting then proceeded to organize as
as & Bka.ncb of the Charleston Auxiliary, to the
American Bible Society. To facilitate tho choice of
officere, a committee of three, was, on motion appointed
to nominate suit&blo persons. After con
sultation the committeej recommended the following
individuals, which recommendation was unanimous,
ly adopted, viz:
JAME3 K. DOUGLAS, President.
,A. D. JONES, Vice President.
J. C. WEST, Secretary.
W. ANDERSON, Treasurer &? Depository.
D. L. DESAUSSURE, )
W. E. HUGHSON, ? Visitors.
J. S. DEPASS. )
Tho meeting was then closed with prayer.
Wo shall endeavour before long to publish the con.
etitution which the society has adoptod, and trust
that the benevolent work in which the association is
engaged will commend itself to the support and on- 1
couragement of all who desire to promote the cause
of Christianity. v
0*A bill to provide against the suspension of specie
payments by tho banks of this Stato did finally
pass both branches of the St&to Legislature. Its
provisions, we learn, are as follows: The Banks are
to mako monthly returns to the Comptroller General,
which are to be collated and published; and >n the
ovent of a suspension thoy are to pay 5 per cent, per
annum on the amount of their circulation during the
period they may remain in a state of suspension.?
The Banks to accept the provisions of this act by
the first of March next, or the Attorney General is
directed to proceed against them in order to vacate
their charters in consequence of former suspensions.
LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS.
We regret that we have not been able to lay l?e.
fore our readore weekly, during the late session of
the Legislature more copious extracts from the Jour.
nals of the two Houses; this regret, however, would
have been greatly enhanced, if those proceedings
had been generally of a very interesting character.
But such has not boon the case, and oar patrons have
not therefore lost rauoh, by our omission in this respect.

We continue to-day, as far as we ore able, our extracts
from the Journals, of such matters as seem to
us of interest to our readers.

His Excellency's drawing rooms were thrown open
last evening, for the reception of company. They
vi xi brilliantly and beautifully decorated, and the
Jirong of beauty and talent with which they were
:rowded, has never been equalled in Columbia. Tho
ladies were individually presented to the Governor, &
iheir reception was most hospitably gratifying. The
cpublican simplicity of his Excellency's manners
node on all his guests, a most gratifying impression.
Conversation, vocal and instrumental music and dan:ing
constituted the entertainments. Those drawing
