CONGRESS.
In the Senate, the bill to establish a
board of claims, to pass upon private claims
row referred to the Committee on claims
has passed, after some days of debate. A
report has been made by the President
stating the number of persons kilk-d and
the amount of property destroyed in Florida
by the Semino'e Indians since the commencement
of the war.
Mr. Webster on the 29th Jan. offered n

Commerce to inquire whether ibe law on
the subject of steamboat navigation needs
amendment, and at the suggestion of Mr.
Orondy agreed to lay it on the tablo and
draw up a bill to be referred to the committee
with the resolut'on.
lit the Hovse of Representatives, by
aid of the previous question the debate on the
slavery question was brought to a close on the
28tb. Jan. and the following resolution adeptted.
Resolved, That the following be adopted as
a standing rule of this House, to be nnmbered
the 21st:
44 That no petition, memorial, resolution, or
other paper, praying for the abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia or any State or
Territory, or the slave-trade between the
States or Territories of the United States in
which it now ex'st* shall be received by
this House or entertained in a y way whatever."
On former occasions the house always
dodged the question of reception by laying it
on the table; they have now boldly met it and
made it a standing rule not to receive.

Correspondence of the Charleston Courier.
Washington Jan 23.
There aro some who douo: whether the
Sub-Treasury biil will pass <he House, no;
30 much on account of tin-' Whig opposition
to it, as the disagreement of i s friends in
regard to its details. But, if the Cumnm toe
cf Ways and Means report it, without
amendment, it will he prefix sure of a speedy
enactment. The House does not seem to
have much business to do at this session;
and, therefore, it is, perhaps, that they delay
for so long a time, the commencement of
any business. At the end of two months
the Standing Committees have not yet bnen
put possession of any business, and no petj
ions have been referred to them. The
President's Message has not been referred
to the appropriate Committers, and, in fict
no business lias been commenced, cxcep
thai of the Ways and Means, in regard ti
the appropriaiions. The House has pro
vided for i:s own pay, and some of ihe bil'i
for the public service had been reported.
Tile Abolition topic rides every thing
else. The House seeins disposed to con
sider that fully and deliberately. The
previous question has been frequ- n ly trieti
and cannot he sustained It appears now
that every gentleman in the House feels
himself called upon to d-ftne his position in
regard to a mailer, as o which you vvill
agree with rnc their ou^/it to be but one
opinion.
Washington, Aug. 24.
Mr. Buehan>n preset!.ed a m inorial
from Pennsylvrfni to-day, praying Congress
to impose a duty on f reign silks.?
Mr. B. made some more remarks in support
of the objects of the memorial?the protection
of the domestic fabric ; the discouragement
of die enormous foreign importation's;
anJ ihe increase of the revenues. Silk is
now free of duty, and he insis s that it will
not violate the compromise act to raise the
duty to twenty per cent, ad valorem. The
amount which we have annually paid for
s Iks for four years past, is from ten to
twenty four millions a year?a great deal
exceeding the export of flour within that
period. Mr. B. stated, as Gen. Thompson
did in the House, die oilier day, that there
would he a deficiency in the revenue for the
present year ; nnd that, before th? end of
this session, Congress would have to provide
more means to meet that deficit. The memorial
was referred. The Senate spent
some time in executive business.
Maine Boundary.?The following is a
brief s'atement of the substance of the pa>
pers acco npanying tho Presidents recent
message to the Senate on this subject fur.
nished by the National Intelligencer.
The material papers are those furnished
by the D -purtmeiU of S:ate, consisting, as
follows:
i. A Let'er from Mr Fox, the British
Minister, to Mr. Forsyh, Sec re ary of S an ,
dated in November last, complaining of the
viol it ion of the agreement entered info
between ih" agen s of the two Governments
last winter, by the opening of roads to the
Aroostook, and the occupation of a pan of
the disputed territory by a body of armed
men employee by the authorities of the
State of Maine.
2. A Letter fiom Mr Forsyth, wri ten
some weeks afterwards, replying to the
complaints of Mr. Fox, that tne opening ol
.1 I ; _
lue roans m qufsnon is not a nrwiv iiich8?
un*, hut in' T'lv carrying out a po icy adopted
iwt I Ye or fourteen years ng > ; that th<*
armed body spoken of is only a passe employed
to drive off intrud-rs; and that
iio lung has been done which may be
justly complained of as infringing the
ugreeinen', such as er cling barracks for
troops on the S\ John's, placing troops on
a part of* the disputed territory, &c.
3. A Letter froin Mr. Fox juatfying
what the British authorities have done, on
the ground of the current report that the
Legislature of the State of Maine had un
intention to abrogate and nullify the agreenu'nt
made between the two countries last
spring, which rumor was loo strongly corroborated
by the language of Governor
Faiifi? Id at the opening of tliu S'-ssioo ol
thai Legisla.ure not to justify precaution-ray
measures, which have not been resorted lo,
however, wuh any design to infringe the
agreement, &c.
4. Another Let'er from Mr, Forsyth to
Mr. Fox, in which lie says that there is no
reason 10 apprehend such on intention as is
imputed to the Legislature of Maine; that
the alleged precautionary measures ore
therefore alto.ether gratuitous on the pan
of the British authorities in Brunswick,
and must be considered "a bold infraction*'
of the agreement of hist winter; and that,
1 the British Government uphold this pro.
cctfrimg on the part of its agents, such n
eoursf?on its p irt wiH he regarded by this
Government as evidence of a want of that
friendly deposition on the pait of Great
Britain wliich has hitherto been believed to
exist, &e.
This is the substance of these Ln,ters,
wliich we expect to he able to puhhsh nl
ferge in our next pnpor.
[A second message has since been sent by th<
President to the Seriate embracing a late lettei
from the British Minister to tlio Secretary o
State, with the answer. Mr. Fox states in tliii
letter that according to official accounts rccciv
Cd bj> hint tine* the data Ms former letters
the troops sent into the disputod territory wen
only sent to supply the plaee of others whicl
were there at the time oftho agreement of tin
two governrnenU, and which- according to-tin
terms of that agreement were allowed to remain
This wiir piobably put an end to the difficulty.]

"The Government and everv citizen o

. The subscriber has for sale a
a large number of very superior
iMorus Multicauiis cut- .
tings, warranted genuine. Owing
to the culture, soil and dis- ]
tance allowed in planting, the j
proportion of large cuttings r<
is believed to be greater than J
in airy other lot offered forj

The following facts will shew ^
the great superiority of large
cuttings over small. A little
more than an acre of the field i
in which the trees stand was b
manured in the hill last spring, t
at the time of planting, with E
rough stable manure, i he J
o I
manure was covered but not
mixed with the soil, and the
cutting planted near it ; the
smaller separate from the (
larger. When the drought
, of spring came on, the i
manure absorbed the mois- ,
ture from the earth around |
the cuttings, and although 1
they sprouted, very few
, came up?in some rows not
one. I he stand was in ,
proportion to the siz of the ?
cuttings. Ol twenty-five about j
and over an inch in dinme- '
ter, planted together, twenty- J
three grew and made fine
trees, now standing in their
places; whilst within a few
