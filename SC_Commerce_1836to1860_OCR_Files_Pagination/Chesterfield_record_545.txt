though that bill had been reported, and <
was different from this, he would vote for t
0hehill now under consideration* His 1
reasons for doing so, he would condense J
ns briefly as possible.
He believed that Congress had power j
to establish a National Bank, or a Fiscal 1
Agent, as you may please to call it. He j
considered the poirer, on the part of Con. !
gress, to be a closed question. When he <
could believe that the Congress which 1
first passed a bill?that Washington, who ]
first signed a bill?that Jefferson, who i
mltwnaA ft hill to establish a branch of the i
?6"
first bank?that the Congress that passed I
the second bank charter*~?that Madison, 1
who signed thecharter?that the Supreme
Court, that has decided upon the question, |
tend the concurrent acquiescence of the <
People of the United States for forty
Vears, were nil ignorant of the Constitu.
tiom and had been willing to violate it? |
when he could believe this, he would doubt, ,
the power of Congress to establish a Bank,
but not till then. I
The question of power being settled in j
this rapid and summary manner, he had j t
but a word to say, and time would allow
him to say but a word, as to the expedien- (
cy of the measure. He thought the measure
of establishing a bank necessary. A
bank could not make business, currency, t
exchanges, and the custody of the public t
money worse than they are now. A j
change will be an improvement, and the ]
experience of the past and the wisdom of
- - * |
(lie present point 10 an inmuuuuu u? t
kind as equally important to the opera- ^
tions of the Government and the business ^
transactions of the People. Public necessity
and public interest all require the
passage of some measure of this kind. ^
Had he the power to frame a bill, he
would make it different in many particulars
from the present. He would prefer a
bank with branches of circulation, with s
power to deal in exchanges, and believed
that such an institution would answer the
purposes of the Government, and would !
give a good circulating medium and equahze
exchang s. He had no time to
discuss the subject, and could but now .
say that he would vote for the present bill
because it seemed to be one most agreea- f
ble to a majority, and he could not hope to ?
effect his wishes in the details of such a t
measure.
Some measure was necessary. The
public interest united with the public voice (
in loud demand for its passage. He (
would cheerfully y ield to the requirements
of both, and sustain the measure. Having y
said this much, he could buf express the '
hope that the measure would pass this (
House, and finally become the law. He ,
had now two minutes left of the 6ve, by .
the Shrewsbury clock, and he would let
some one else appropriate them. 1
The hour of 12, having arrived, the I
Committee; in pursuance of the order of 8
the House of Wednesday, last, proceeded,
withoutTurther debate, to vote on all a
mendments " pending or that might be
offered."
The first question was on the motion of
Mr. Dean to strike out the enacting clause '
of the bill. *
Tellers'wore appointed, (Messrs. Arnold (
and Artherton acting in that capacity ;) 1
and the question, by yeas 87, noes 13G, I
was decided in the negative.
And no further amendment being of.
fered, the committee, on motion of Mr. j
Sergeant, rose and reported the bill to the |
House precisely in the form in which it i
came from the Senate. (
And the question being on ordering the ,
^ bill to a third reading?
Mr. Arnold (doing, he said, what he
never had done before in his life?moved j
the previous question.
And there was a second.
Mr, Clifford asked the yeas and nays on '
ordering the main question, but withdrew '
the motion.
And the main question was ordered to I
be now taken. I
Mr. Ward asked the yeas and nnys on

Upwards of 100 Indians, men, women

them thus far appeared astonishing. All
were perfectly naked. Their limbs were

the stench was insupportable. How beings
could breath such an atmosphere
and live, appeared incredible. Several

Temperance Cause.
. Saratoga Springs July, 31.
, There has been much animation and excitement
this week at the Springs. The
third American Temperance Convention
J commenced its session, in this town, on
Thursday, the 27th instant, and closed its
proceedings, on the 30th inst. at six
1 o'clock P. M. This body was composed
of550 delegates from the severnl States
?Georgia and Alabama were represented
among the Southern States, and Louisiana
and Tennessee among the South
Western. All of the Eastern, Nothern
and Middle States sent their represents,
tives, with Afichigan Iowa, from the Farwest.
There was much zeal and ability
I displayed in the discussion of the questions
brought before the Convention. The

J anecdotes were related of the facility wit h
r which wines, of all descriptions were imi

diich resulted from the use of the simu- w

tie inferior qualities of whiskey more pun- qi
ent, oil of vitriol had been introduced as di

lat an extensive vender of wines had ac- f<

It gives us pleasure to state that all our I
anticipations of the unpopularity of the (
)dious and agrarian doctrine of "Repeal/* *
is proposed to be applied to a Bank Char- |
:er, if one should be granted by Congress j
and become a law, are already more than J
realized; and, what is more gratifying still 1
that so far from its being made a party
question, the leaders will have the greatest
difficulty in preventing an immediate
and indignant outbraek in the rank and
file, in opposition to their prcposterious
idea, and their more wicked agitation.?
A specimen of this we have lately had in
a neighboring country, where the trammels
of party allegiance we are at once snapped
when such a doctrine was made the test
of orthodoxy. Mr. Archer said right, the
other day, when he affirmed that this pecies
of nullification would be more repudiated
in Virginia, than any that bad preceded its
promulgation. We made the same assertion
to the beginning when this cry of Repeal
was first raised by the underlings; and our
confidence in its rejection has not lessened
now that the potent voice of Mr. Calhoun
has been raised in favor?a voice,
we lament to say, heard so often on so
many sides of so many questions, that it
has ceased to carry any longer with it, its

we would desire nothing better to wield
against the agitators, than this same Repeal.
It would be a mace in the hands
of the Republican champions with which
to beat down their adversaries past the
power of raising. The people of this
country area law loving, and law abiding
people. They can be excited to commit
wrong; but they cannot be deliberately
led into the adoption of measures design,

Mississippi Bonds.?Governor McNutt,
of Mississippi, has given Messrs. Hope &
Co., of Amsterdam, notice that "this state
never will pay the five millions of dollars,
issued in June, 1838, or any portion of
the interest due, or to become due there??
on.
"The money" he says "paid for those
bonds did not come into the state Treasury.
The officers of the Government had
no control over its disbursement. The
bonds were disposed of in 1838, by collision
and fraud, in voilation of the Consti*
tution and laws of the State. The Mississippi
Union Bank, and the Bank of the
United States, were parties to this uulawful
transaction. You have the endorsement
of both these institutions, and to
them you must look for payment."

LACING.
A NEW SOCIETY.?LOOK OUT GIRLS.
It is stated in the Boston Post that a
meeting of young men in that city, called
to take into consideration the reason why
so many of their fair young fellow citizens
are afflicted with such feeble health, are
unable to use only moderate exercise,
and are so often cut off in the prime of
life, and brought to a premature grave?
after much discussion, a thorough investigation,
and very minute observation of the
subject, unanimously arrived at one conclusion,
and that is this, viz: feebleness
and inability to use violent exercise, and
palefacedness, arises from the deleterious
use of stays, which they lace around theirI
bodies enormously tight, almost to suffocation.
As far 88 we ar* able to ascer-!
tain (they say in their report) it is done j
to improve their forms, hut in our opinion
it very jnufch deforms them; and while
they try to make their waists as small as
possible! they are using the best possible
method to waste their comfort, happiness,
and even life itself. After a serious consideration
of these astounding facts, the
meeting unanimously adopted the follow,
ing resolutions, viz:
Resolvedt That we will not have anything
to dp with any young ladv whom
'?. i - *

Resolved, That if we should be so an*
irtunate as to be smitten with a young
idy whom we know to use those said ar.
