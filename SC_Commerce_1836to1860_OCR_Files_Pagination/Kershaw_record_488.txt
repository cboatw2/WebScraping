NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY.
i Pram the Augusta (Maine) Age.
We publish below a letter upon this subject,
from Col. Johnson, with that of Dr
Oonv; to which it i* an answer.
> - ' AUGUSTA, Me. Feb. 2.
Sir? It cannot be unknown to you thai
th'tf-people of this Slate feel a lively ten'
Nihility to the opinions of all public men ir
" 'this country, upon the gre4l. absorbing nn<
Vftal question of our territorial rights*: 1
I do not mistake the signs of the times
- this momentous subject is fast verging u
n crisis, and neither the arts of dipimnac)
nor the tantalizing tardiness of transatlan
tic negocialions, can much longer avert #r
issue. .
The heel of the invader which is grind
ing into our vitals, will soon reach thi
quick. ' . . ?
For the awakened attention of the gen
eral mind throughout the Union, and the
increased interest fell in the question eve
ry where, much has been owing to the spi
rited discussions and the unexampled una
nimity qf sentiments upon the question o
right, which has been exhibited in botl
houses.of Congress within the . last fou
years. But the partiality of your coon
trymen has placed you during that perioi
in a station where your voice could no
be heard. Believing that your views upoi
this important subject would be eagerly
read, not only by this Stale but by th<
whole country, is my apology for asking
you to make them public.
I am. sir, very respectfully,
Your ob't. servant,
ROBERT A.. CONY.
To Col. R. M. Johnsok,
Yice President of the U. States.
Washington, Feb. 6, 1841.
My Dear Sir: -To your inquiries res
peeling my opinion on the question con'
cerning the Northeastern boundary of the
United States, I will frankly reply.
Congress have no constitutional right tc
dismember a State or any part of her territory,
nor to concede to a foreign power
one foot of the territory of these United
Slates. It is one of those points or
which a majority of Congress, or even a
majority of a State Legislature cannoi
constitutionally yield assent. If an individual
citizen became the lawful proprietor
of but an acre of land within the U.
Slates, there is uo power existing, eithei
in the General Government, or in the Government
of the State in which he is located.
to expatriate him by transferring hit
?"Tr " ? - ? #
residence to a foreign power. His citizenship
is his birthright. His land is his
inheritance. Government is pledged to
protect him in the enjoyment of both? his
State Government to guard his property,
and both Governments to guard his right 1
as a citizen. The only question then ii
that of the true boundary. If thebounda
ry can be ascertained, there can be n<
compromise of the question. The value o
the disputed territory is a matter of n<
consideration. If it be but a barren acre
or the whole State of Maine, the princi
pic is the same; and though it may cos
another eight years' war of the whole na
tion, the whole nation is bound to sustain
it. The integrity of our territory is iden
tified with our independence, and canno
be impaired without the sacrifice of oci
national character.
Can the boundary be defined? Thisii
the only question at issue. If it cannot, t
compromise is necessary. If it can be de^
fined, it cannot be changed. To settle this
point we must first refer to the treaties ol
peace with Great Britain.
The first of these, called the provisional
aiticleof peace, signed at Paris, Nov. 30
1782, defines the boundary as follows:
44 From the northwest angle of Novs
Scotia, wtz: that angle which is formed by
a line drawn due north from thi source ol
St. Croix river to the highlands, along the
ssid highlands, which divide those riven
which empty themselves into the river St
Lawrence, from those which fall into tin
Atlantic Ocean, to the northwestermos
head of Connecticut river: thence dowr
aiiHg the middle of that river to the fortj
fifth degree of north latitude; from thence
by a line due west on said latitude, unti
it strikes the river Iroquois or Cataraquay
thence along the middle of said river inlc
Lake Ontario," dte:
The next is the definitive treaty of peact
between the two countries, signed at Paris
Bept. 3, 1783. In this last the boundary
is defined in the same words as in the fur
men ' ,
From this definition, there can be no dif
iiCulty in ascertaining the true boundary
provided the source of the St. Croix rivei
call be determined. This has been settler
' by a joint commission of the two Govern
-- 1 ? f*Kw o nmnnmnnf ?
menu,' anu im?nvc? ? ...... ?
therefore constitutes no part of this con
troversy. From this monument a line
drawn clue north is the fixed boundary be
tween the United States and Nova Scotia
now New Brunswick. This lin*' contin
vfes till it intersects that line of the high
lands tVhtch divide the waters that fall intci
St. Lawrence from the waters which find
their way into the Atlantic Ocean without
jpingling with those of the St. Lawrence.
It appears to me, that language could not
make it more detinue, anu tint live wosi
ordinary surveyor, governed by this definition,
could not vary a perch in marking
the line. \ due west line cannot he drawn
with mathematical accuracy, because it it
a curve upon the plane of the horizon; bul
a north line may be drawn with the greatest
ease, and the highest points of land
upon every part of the dividing line b<v
tweet) H'flter courses taking opposite di
reclions, caTn ^ascertained certain^
*7'
If we had no guide but thfe Iang'ti*ge!of
the treaties, there could be no ground fur
' doubt; but the case is rendered yet strong
er by other corroborative circumstances.
The British Government claims the territory
north of Mars Hill; and contends
I that the point specified in the treaty as
the northwest angle of Nova Scntin is that
1 hill. But there is no angle in.the line oi
I Nova Scotia at that point. The boundary
f -r !.?< r?niurnm nnndmicil In a
? right line more than a hundred miles norlh
> of Mars Hill; and to call it the northwest
' angle, when there is no angle, no northern
- bonndarv, would be absurd. r'
' Ij is contended that the rivers which fall
into estuaries of the ocean tlbChot empty
* themselves into the ocean. This is too
s trifling a quibble to need refutation. Il
v may with as much propriety be said that
- the Blue Ridge, and not the AHeghany, is
e the dividing highland between the river*
- which empty themselves into the Missis*
sippi, and those which empty itrto the At*
Ian tic, because the rivers fotirih'bays before
f *hfcy reach tho ocean. '
i - It ia < < >!iondf>d ili.it the highlands, or
r which Mars Hill is situated, are mere elerated
than those which divide the water:
1 of the Atlantic from tnose of the St,
I Lawrence. If such were the fact, it would
i not constitute them the highlands describ>'
*d in the treaties. The Restock, the
Aliguash, the Matawaska, and several
\ other rivers, lie north of the ridge foi
which the British Government contend,
and they all fall into the Su Johns; and
the St. Johns also lies wholly north ol
that ridge, and it empties into the Bay ol
Fundy, which is an estuary of the ocean,
To sustain their claim then, they musi
make the Bay of Fundy to be the rivei
Saint Lawrence. The Memptcook, the
Grande Fourche, and the Ristigoucli into
which they empty, all take their rise in
the disputed territory, and the Ristigoucli
does not fall into the St. Lawrence, bul
1 into the Bay Chaleur: The case then is
' as clear as demonstration can make it.
It is urged that the British commission.
ers, in the treaty of peace, did not intend
to deprive their provinces of a direct
' communication between Hnlifix and duei
bee. Their intention is better known
by their acts, than by modern construe
tion; and the British Government, first in
Europe for wisdom and intelligence,
' should be the last Government on earth
to plead ignorance in a matter on which
they were negotiating.
Before the conquest of Canada from
the French, Nora Scotia extended to the
> St. Lawrence, and its northwest angle
1 was on that river, and at the point where
' the line drawn due north from the source
> of the St. Croix will intersect it. The
' west side of that line was New England,
i and the east side Nova Scotia. When in
the treaty ?>f 1763 the territory of Canada
? was confirmed to the British, the province
f of Quebec, as it was then called, was
> constituted a British province; and as the
, city of Quebec was situated on the St.
Lawrence, the province was extended
t south of the highlands which divide the
waters of the ocean from those of the St.
' Lawrence, so as to include the valley ul
that river. This took from the north ol
I Nova Scotia and New England that nar
' row strip of territory, from the Bay
Chaleurs on the east, along the highlands
i which divide those waters, to the eastern
t bank of the Connecticut on the west, in
laiitiirtu iR mid frnm thn<tf> hinrlilnnds nn
i the south, to the St. Lawrence on the
f north. The proclamation which defined
this boundary was dated Oct. 7, 1763. In
I 1774, it was confirmed by act of Parliament.
That line was the undisputed
' northern boundary of Nora Scotia and
New GngLnd from that time forward.?
1 The commissioners of the King of Great
' Brilian to his Governors, all recognise
this line as the southern boundary of
: Canada; and a claim for any territory
1 south of it was never intimated foi half a
* century after.
* Such arc my views concerning the
true boundary of the northeastern part ? (
1 the State of Maine; and such my scntir
ments of the obligation of the United
[ Slates to maintain thai boundary. The
' possession of any part of the territory
' within it by Great Britian, is a violation ol
' the treaty of pea*e, and an invasion ol
the United States.
5 The only remaining question then is
? that of expediency. The question ol
' right is settled; and what stronger con*
firms it is, that no American, who had
,, ever examined the subject,'dissents from
- the decision. The ties of.-consanguinity,
, of affection and of interest, which exist
r between this country and Great Brilian,
I are so strong, and so cordially cherished
hy most Americans that scarcely an act of
Gieat Britian, however unwarranted by
the laws of nations or of equity meets with
unqualified censure. Even their depredations
upon our commerce, and their
impressment of our seamen during their
wars with France, found many apologists
in America, und if their cluim in this case
> had (he slightest shadow of justice, it
I fin,I its advocates nmnn<r lis: lint so
I far as my information extends, it has not
. found a solitary American to make an
t apology for it. What then is the course
l which expediency dictates? We have de
rived nil our institutions and most of us
our being, from Oritian. We have more
i intercourse, more udinities, and deeper
i interest* with Iter, than with all the world
t besides. To maintain peace with her is
> worth' much forbarance; indeed, any
I thing short of degradation. Great Bri.
tain has ever been slow to do us justice,
but she eventually comes to it; and when
'she doVs\tf she does it with magnanimity. J
iShe retained-possession of Michigan,
more than twelve years after fhe close of
the Revolutionary war; yet she finally
relinquished it without a rupture; and "I ,
[am of the opinion that she will yet fore|
go this claim: It is no less her interest
than ours, to cultivate harmony between (
the countries. This territory in dispute is
much less important to her than to us.?
Her claim is without the shadow of right;
and she will certainly wake to a sense of'
justice. It will not be wise for us to resort
to violent measures, till all hope
from negociation shall be exhausted, and
a settled determination shall be manifested
on her part to hold the territory.?
I Whenever that period shall arrive, the
last resort of nations will be our only alteri
native. In such an issue, our whole coun.
try will be unanimous. All the energies
i of the nation will be enlisted. The devos
lion of every heai taud the strength of every
i arm will be exerted in the common cause;
- and the result will be, success and victory

THE COTTON CROP.
> We have watched the progress of the
| market and the arrival of the crop with no
little anxiety?from the apparently well,
grounded fear, not yet fully relieved, that
j the great Influx of Cotton during the early
f part of the seasbn, would, whert fully felt
f in the European market, create a revul,
sion in the price of our staple. The dant
ger of suclHin effect is not in our opinion
- "ai nn.ao^. onil wfi rptrnrd tile nresent
- - i
time as the most critical moment of the
( season, to the speculators in Cotton?but
i that is their look out. We have endeai
vored as far as depended on the influence
; of one Journal, to ward off such revulsion
i hy an exposition of the true slate of the
crop an?l the reasons peculiar to the yenr
. which had brought so large a part of it
| prematuiely to market. These reasons
t and the conclusion we drew from them,
. stand now umply confirmed. On the 1st
, of January last, we staked our credit on
, the prophecy, that, by the first of March,
i the receipts of the present crop would
have fallen short of the same period last
year, 200,000 bales. The fallowing is a
comparative statement of the receipts in
all the Southern ports to the latest dates:
1840 1 1839-40
N. Orleans, Feb. 20, 476,692 634,977
Mobile, ' 44 24, 182.335 544,878
Florida, 44 6, 35,838 212,550
Georgia, 44 25, 62,453 130,405
S. Carolina, 4- 26, 111,086 163,212
N. Caaolina, 44 6, 2119 4631
Virginia, 44 1, 4655 6000
10 431 15.141
Utu toiuiivij - -1 .vy
887,010 1,100,137
897,010
2I2;527
[ It appears then that the receipts of the
, present year so far, have fallen short of
T the same dates last year 212.527 bales.?
r Let it be remembered too, that for two
. nmntf.s after the commencement of the
season, the receipts of the present crop
i exceeded those of last year, and that at
i the lime ive made the prophecy now so
i completely fulfilled, the receipts had not,
i lallen short of the greatest crop yet pro-'
i duced.
From the comparative statement given'
above, we are also able to estimate with
some certainty, the entire amount of the
rrop. At the dates given above in 1810,
I more than half of the crop had come to
market. If we allow the same proportion
of the present crop to have come in, the
entire amount of the rron will be about
' 1.680,000 bales. But the arguments we
adduced on a former occasion to show that
the present crop was much earlier gather*
ed and much,more rapidly thrown into the
market, induce us to make a still further
* deduction ..from the present crop, which
. on the besl.consideration we have been
able to give the subject, we set down at
: not over 1,600*030 bales. It is improbable
that the crop will much fall short of
f that, and still more improbable that it will
f much exceed it. With this limit to production,
no one will say that the rise in
t price is extravagant, or that if it were unr
derstood, there would be any danger of a
, depression in our staple. The true danger
is, that our friends across the water will
draw wrong conclusions from the great i.i-|
flux of t/)e crop in the first four months of
the seasons.?Mercury.
We see it stated in the Raleigh Re

deliberately despatched him. After concealing
the body in the leaves, he went
to the house and told his mistress, that
his master had sent him for his horse and
pocket-book, intending to go to a store
that was near; they were accordingly
sent, and a little son of Mr. Pratt's was
sent with the negro. On the ,way, the
negro knocked the child down with a

The light and trifling, as well as the irrcveroni
manner in which quotations from the sacred volumi
are continually introduced into Congressional speech
cs, editorial articles on political questions, and ever
reports of the proceedings on the race course, is be
coming so common and so disgusting as to call loud
ly for the condemnation of all those who profess an]
regard for tho solemn truths of holy writ, or who ii
any degree look to their influence for the prcservatioi
of sound morals. No more fatal blow can be struct
at the influence of religion.?nothing is better cal
culated to strengthen the cause of infidelity,?1<
undo and to render nugatory the efforts of tho chris
tian world, than the indiscriminate, the irreverent
and, we may add, the blasphemous introduction o
scripture quotations on all occasions, and under cir
cumstanccs which make them peculiarly inappro
priatc and hurtful.
Will not our brethren of the press, who havi
thoughtlessly and inadvertently been led into tlx
practice, reflect on its deleterious effects, its fata
consequences, and refrain from the use of these so
lomn quotations, except when discussing questions
the importance of which render their introductioi
justifiable? Wo are well convinced that there an
many of our brother editors who have a high regno
for tho "sacred oracles," who are in the habit o
mingling in thcir^>olitic&l disquisitions, passages o
scripture which have grated harshly on our cars
and wo doubt not havo been the cause of regret am
?r thotr wadnriL The last numbe
of the South Carolinian close* an interesting articf
on the subject of the Banks with a quotation, which
to our mind, was entirely out of place. The higl
stand which the Carolinian occupies on the subjee
of religion and morals, and our own knowledge o
the character of the editor, forbids any other suppe
sition, than that this, as well as other quotations fron
the sacred scriptures which we have noticed in hi
columns, were introduced from the best and purest c
motives, but we think a moment's reflection wil
convince him that the cause of morals and religioi
will suffer more from indulging in this practice thai
will be repaid by the advancement of the principle
they were introduced to sustain.
It was not those quotations, howover, which at
traded our attention particularly to tho subject a
this time, but an article which appeared in the Char
leston Mercury of the 5th instant This article i
copied in a commendatory stylo from the New Yorl
Spirit of the Timet, and is an introduction to an ac
count of tho racos over the Washington course. Thi
irreverent manner in which the holy scriptures an
quoted in this article, must shock every ono who ha
the least regard for its sacred truths, or who has anj
respect for those who do regard them. Wo shouh
I be pleased to believe that the publication of this ar

# v ?; v? niiOf iu i'uf
citizens, is strongly illustrated by a recent
occurrence. The Rail Road and Stage
travel is still continued, and on Sunday1
last a single copy of the Charleston Patriot
of Saturday, containing the late
European News by the Britannia, wa*
brought by a pnssenger, and {riven to orte
of our merchants. No advantage was'
i taken of this; but it is easy to perceive'
that it affords great opportunities for Extensive
private speculation on the news of

i single individual in Charleston, to another
i in this place. No Charleston or Northern

To remedy the discontinuance of the
Sunday mail by the Post Master General,
. Mr. McLean, the Stage Contractor, witlr
. the liberality and public spirit for which
he is s<? much distinguished, declared hi*
willingness to carry that Mail free of
charge, if the Post Masters in Columbia
t and Charleston would make it up and tie*
5 liver it, as usual. This we learn by a letter
we have seen, from Charleston, which
, also slates, that the Post Master in Charleston
9ays "he cannot send a mail on
that day without orders from the Department."
The Post Mnster in Columbia, is
j very willing to send the mail while the
Stage goes, and indeed considers it his
duty to do so, and that of the contractor
to take it, while he runs the Stage. The
contract is for six days a week, the Sunday
mail has been paid for extra; and we
presume the only motive the Post Master
\ General can have for discontinuing it, is
' :.i ,1..* !/
in avuiu uiui expense. 11 me oiage ira*

will be regularly and numerously sent by

thus lessened. How, then, can

to the Mail being delivered on Sonday,
or the Post Master in Charleston sup'
pose his authority necessary for the delivery
of it? And is it not strange that

necessary, while the Post Master in this
