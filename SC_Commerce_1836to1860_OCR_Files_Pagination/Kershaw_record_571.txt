Kershaw Troop.?We are requested to state that

TRIAL OF McLEOD.
This interesting and important trial commenced
at Utica, Now York, on Monday the 4lh instant.
No great progress had been inado in the case at our1
latest dates. The first day was occupied in the for.
mation of a Jury, and in this there seemed to bo
much less difficulty than might have been supposed,1
from the excited state of public feeling, in that
section of the country. We have accounts of the '
examination of a groat number of witnesses on the
part of the prosecution, all of whom testified to the
killing of Durfce, for whoso murder McLeod is
' tried, but none had yot implicated the prisoner in the
'transaction, or proved that he was present on the oc.
-casion. Of course there are many other witnesses
still to give evidence, the complexion of whicli it is ?
impossible to determine from the contradictory reports
which are put in circulation.
We arc inclined to the opinion, howover, from all
that wo have seen upon the subject, that McLeoo
will be acquittod.
It is a source of gratification, in relation to this
trial, to hear that although, the city of Utica, is!
filled with persons, carriod there, in consequence of,
the interest taken in the result, yet the utmost or-!
der and propriety is preserved, and from all accounts(
no violent ebullition of feeling is anticipated, whether
tho prisoner bo convicted or acquitted.
From tl^o excited state of our frontier population,
and from the rumours of threatened disturbances at
this trial, we had our fears that the ends of public
justice might be defeated, tho whole country disgraced,
and its peaqe placed in even greater jeopardy
than it is alteady. Tho various letter writers and
reporters on the spot, however, present a very difr
, 1 ?nta.sinir niotnrn nf flin Rrnnfi. than
luiuin. unu iuuib ? ... ,
wo had any reason to anticipato, and wo trust that
the good order, which has marked the commencc" ment
of the proceedings in this important trial, will
continuo to be observed and that there will be nothing
to excite a blush of shame on our check at its
\ conclusion. ?
Georgia Elections.?-We are indebted to a slip
from the olfica of the Augusta Constitutionalist,
for returns of the oloction of Governor and members
of the Legislature, from forty-three counties in
Georgia. These returns afford the most cheering
prospect for the cause of Democracy in that State.
McDonald the democratic candidate for Governor
was 507 votes ahead of his opporiant, the Hon. \V.
C. Dawson, while in the same counties last year
the whig majority was 3162, making a clear democratic
gain of 3669 votes.
Democracy Triumphant. In addition to the
choering news which wo have from Georgia, of the
ascendancy of democratic principles, we have the
* ploasuro of stating that old Maryland is in the pro.
gross of revolution. The democratic majority in
Baltimore alone, has been increased since the Presidential'elcction,
from 36 to 1049. And in almost
every section of the State, from which intelligence,
lias been received, the diraocratic majorities have
been enlarged, and the whigsdiminished.
The democrats have gained ten, probably thirteen
members in the House of delegates as far as heard
from.
A similar, if not a more glorious, triumph is
confidently expected in Pennsylvania and New York.
Hard Cider and Coonskins have lost their charm. |
Federalism must invent somo new humbug, or "the
| sober second thought" of tho people will hurl them
from their ill gotten seats of power.
Latest From Europe.?By the Steamer Acadia,
nt Boston, wc have dates from Europe fifteen days
later than those previously received, being from Li.
verpool to tho 19lh ult. The political news by this
arrival, is not of very great importance, nothing
having transpired with respect to the relations exist,
ing between this country and Great Britain, possess,
ing any interest whatever.
The advices in relation to the Cotton market aro
of the most unfavorable character, prices havo dc.
clinod 1-2(1, and tho sales are not very large; the
StOClt on nana too, 18 ucciucuiy luigui uian u 1.1 IU
fame period last year.
The weather has boon much moro favorable than
was anticipated at the last accounts, and the har.
vesting had succeeded beyond expectation. The
crops, however, it is supposed will fall short one
sixth or one seventh.
From the Continent thore is also little of importance,
xcept that considerable excitement existed in Paris
in consequence of an attempt to assassinate one of
ithe Royal Family. The Duke d'Autnale is the in.dividual
upon whom this attempt was made; he had
just arrived in Paris, and was marching at the head
of the 17th light Infantry, in company with three J
s- of his brothers, 'when a p'n^ol was discharged nt him, J
by a man named Pappard; fortunately, however, the
. a _ n* a. n . ? . ? '
shot did noi tane encci. x"afpard wrh immediately
arrested. Great excitement existed in Paris, but
aay general disturbance, was happily prevented.
Sugar from Cornstalks.?A Mr. Webb, of Delaware,
has Buccocdod, it is said, in manufacturing'
sugar from the Cornstalk, and the result of his ex.
pcriocnt is attracting publie attention.
.*
17m citizens of Woodville Kentucky have made
the Hon. J. J. Crittenden a present of tho farm
upon whiell ho was born. It cost them seventeen1
thousand dollars.
Bursting of Cannon.?The New York Journal
of Commerce states that a fow days since, a sixtyfour
pound gun burst on board tho steam frigate
Fulton, killing two men instantly, and badly
wounding several others, besides doing considerable
damage to the ship.
With respect to accidents of this nature, we were
surprised to see it stated by a writer in the last
Southern Literary Messenger, that we actually lost
more men on the Lakes during the last war, from
the bursting of our own guns thgn from Uio shot of
. '*Vv:- r' ;
t -
r. . ?4r
JSf- V; .V'
tho enemy. Theso facts, and the frequent recurrence
of accidents of this character, should direct
public attention to the necessity of an improvement
in tho manufacture of these engines of war.
FOR TUB JOURNAL.
Mr. Editor: I perceive, in your paper of Wednesday
last, a'communication over the signature of
"Many Voters,'1 calling the attention of the public
to a contemplated candidate for Congress; who it
socmB has boen brought out, in anticipation of our
present Representative doclining another canvass.
Whatcvor, is the intention of Mr. Sumter in this
particular, I know not?as far as I have been informed,
he can have no such idea. Be that however
as it may, it takos not from us, the right or the
privilege of suggesting another, or of advocating
such change as tho exigency of the times, may render
necessary. It is, however, too soon, to begin
to look so far ahead, particularly on account of the
change that must take place before tho next election
in the apportionment of the Congressional Districts
throughout tho State, by which we aro to bo reduced
to seven, instead of nino representatives, so
that it is impossible now, for cithor Lancaster,
Kershaw, Sumter, or Chesterfield, to say what will
be exactly their position?hence the inutility of any
decided action on the subject. If, however, wo
aro to consider further delay as dangerous, and aro
fully -satisfied, that this is the most proper time,
it does certainly "become onr duty to look about us
and select a man of stern democracy, of untiring
and unflinching zeal, a man who is able to bring
forward practicable propositions, and defend them
in debate, publicly or privately, who will ever prove
faithful on tho watchtower of our country." But

success, lot us cxtond our view by looking all around
as well as "about us" aud see if an individual can
bo found combining not only all the above qualifications,
but adding thereto, tnuch of that "suaviter in
modo" so essentially necessary to the proper regulation
of that "stern democracy and unflinching zeal"
which already have dod$ so much in degradation of
the honor, and character of our national Legislature.
By thus extendi^ our observations,-.we will
bring to our view YVm. McWillie Esq. whoso position
in the Slato at this time, must under-any circumstances,
command for hiin that prudent consideration,
which now, more than cvor, it becomes us
to exercise, in the selection of an individual to an
office, of so responsible, and paramount importance.

The Yellow Fever.?The Raleigh Register
in a paragraph referring to the
Yellow Fever in New Orleans, &c. says,
"it is also raging violently in Charleston."
We cannot possibly divine how the editor
of the Register could have admitted such
an expression into his columns, in the
face of positive proof to the contrary in
our Board of Health reports, unless he
has thoughtlessly reiterated the reports
of interested agents, engaged in slandering
our city with the intention of diverting
the course of travel through it to some
other point, the facilities of the North'
Carolina Rail Road and Steam Boats being
so great as to render any attempt of tho
kind hopeless unless by misrepresentation.
That the editor could have made this statement
knowing it false we have not the
least reason to believe, as we are ourselves
aware of the liability of editors to be
imposed on; we therefore have no doubt
that he will immediately and promptly
contradict if, when he learns that Charleston
was never more healthy than during
the past summer and at this time, and thai
no case of Yellow Fever Jtas occurred
during the season. During the week ending
on Sunday last, there were but six
deaths three whites andthrefr blacks; two
under one year old.

Departed this life, after a lingering illucss, on the
night of the 2d inat. Mr, William Dunlap, of Lancaster
District, in the 75th year of his nge. The
domestic character of the deceased and his unobtrusive
habits, may have prevented his namo, being
spread abroad, but with those to whom he was 1
known and who enjoyod iiis acquaintance, his memory
will bo cherished and endeared, by all the 1
most tender and affectionate recollections of life; he
was exomplary, in tho faithful and prompt discharge 1
of his duties. As a husband, he was most affectionate
and devoted; as a father, kind and indulgent, J
as a neighbor, obliging, benevolent and hospitable, '
' and as a citizen and christian, universally confidod
! in, beloved and honored. For many years, he has
j been a zealous and. constant member of the Presbyi
terian Church, firmly believing in its doctrines and
conforming to its discipline. But, at the same time,
exercising, towards, all other denominations, the
highest degree of tolerance, ant! "Charity. Indeed, 1
it may well bo said of him, he was a Christian; not
alone in profession, but in practice. One who obey-1
cd the precept- of divino revelation with scrupulous
exactness, but without ostentation. Never has the
: writer of this witnessed, il more imposing, though |
! humble religious ervices, than around tho family j
altar of the deceased: nor can he ever forget, the j
! soothing influence of tffet^ervice. The deep and
ferment energy of that voice in prayor, though trcm- 1
bling and broken by age, the unaffected piety
breathed in ovory word and the perfect sincerity and
confidcnco of bis aspirations were really tiic out'
pouring of tho heart.'
1 He has left a boreaved wife and numerous relations
to mourn his loss. , ^
