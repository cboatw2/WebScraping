.which made it almost word for word, the

atid the resolution was then passed.
Mr. Walker submitted the following res
olutions whichrwere agreed to.
-Resolved, That the Select Committee,
to whom was referred the questien of e
porting to the Sedate on the subject of a
fiscal a ent for the Government of the
nited States be directed to inquire into the
expediency of vesting the control of said
agency in a board of six directors, located
* at the city of Washington, to be chosen by
a joint vote of both Houses of Congress,
two of said directors to be elected at each
successive vote, each member being per
mitted to vote only on each occasion for
one director, so as to prevent said board be
* ing placed under the control of the Execu
tive or of any part.
Resolved, That said committee be also
instructed to inquire into the expediency
* of tendering to the States branches of said
fiscal agency, on the condition precedent
that said Statesh have first entered into an
agreement with each other for the gradual
and prospective limitation or abandonment
Resolted, That said committee be also
-instructed to inquire into the expediency of
confining said agency to the use of gold and
silver, and of bis receivable of the Gov
- ernment of the United States of large de
nominationS, excluding all the paper of the
Statebanks, and so as to retain an ade
quate supply and circulation of gold as well
as silver at all times in the United States.
Resolved, That said committee be also
instructed to inquire into the expediency
of applying, prospectively the bankrupt
power of this Government to the State
*banks.- ..
* The Chair then presented a Report from
ther Secretary of the Treasury containing
b is plan of a Fiscal Agent, which was read.
On motion of Mr. Clay, of Kentucky,
the report and accompanying bill were re
ferred-so the Select Committee on the sub
ject, and 1500 additional copies ordered to
Tebill to distribute the proceeds of the
-sales of the public lands among the States,

(,oiimittee on the Public Lands.

In the House several Abolition petitions
were- presented, which gave rise'to angry

WASHINOTON, June 14.
In the Senate to-day several -memori
tls praying the passage of a general bank(
upt law, were presented. *Mr. Wriift
>resented a memorial from a portion of
he New York Chamber of Commerce,
-emonstrating.Againstthe charter ofa Uni
ed States B'idk. Mr.vSiir-ealled up
he resolution submitted byf hijilsome days
ince, inquiring-of the Secretary. of War
be -names of the persons alludedto in his
-eport as conniving at frauds perpetrated in
he disbursement of public money for the
ubsiistence..of 'enigrating Indians. Mr.
Vlorehead, (Mr. Clay's colleague) opposed
he motion, on. the ground that the iuves:
igation was not'yet complete; and that no
ndividual had been inculpated by name.
Kr. Sevierrieplied by asking why the Sec
retary had been in such haste to hold up to
public odium a large body of men, when he
was not prepared to .specify his charges or
to name the individuals. There had been
but two emigrating agents concerned in.the
isbursements alluded to-Captains Ste
venson and Armstrong. The former cea
ed his connection in 1839, and the latter is
itill retained in that office. The imputa
tion was then evidently intended for the
Former, at least such will be the impression
afall who understand the position in-which
e stood to these disbursements. That
gentlemati courted investigation,- and he
(Mr. Sevier) asked in the most public
manner to obtain the testimony on which
these chargesjad been made against the
agents and contractors of the Southiest,
and for the names of these charged with
corruption. He did dot know whether such
things did or did not exist, but he main
tained his right to call for information on
the subject. If there is an investigation
going on, let it not be a star chamber in
vesigation.
Mr. Morehead still persisted in his op
position, and the resolution was laid on the
table-ayes 24, nave 22-Messrs. Archer
and Barrow with thbe minority.
The correspondence between Mr. Web
ster and Mr. Fox was then taken -up, and
Mr. Preston spoke for upwards of an hour
and a half in defenceiofthe course pursued
by the Secretary of State. His points
ere that the law as laid down by Fox and
admitted by. Webster, was correct, Thai
admitted, it was the-duty of the Secretary,
promptly to take such measures as would
ensure the saityiiidirelease' of McLeod.
He eulogised the letter of'Mr. Webster iu
gloiing terms, chareeterisqgiL as a noblei

qunoched Inh :tremendoits gult~ He al
luded with afueh-bitterness to the report of
Mr. Pickens at the last session, denouncin
it as violent, infiamatory, and senit to the
world to. excite a panic, when he and his
frieds could do nothing else than make
panics.
Mr. Benton followed, and commenced
his speech by warning gentlemen of the
danger of taking sides against our country
in a controversy with a foreign power. He
denied that the act for which McLeod was
in custody was an act of war. A number
of Englishmen in Cpnada, of their own
voluntary uet, without the knowledge of
the colonial authorities, had banded to
ethr, crossed the Niagara, attacked an
narmed vessel and sleeping men whoc
were within ihe jurisdiction of one of the
Sovereigu States of this Union. That it
was a mere simple act of robbery, arson
and murder, nnd did not come within the
pale of the laws ofrnations, but wvas subject
to the municipal laws ofthe State in which
the act was perpetrated. He denounced
the instructions to Mr. Crittendon ns illegal
and disgracef ul to the country ; illegal as
be had no right io comimand him to go intc
a State sovereignty, and oppose the course
f her municipal law; and disgraceful, as
they were given in the face of a threat
rom a foreign power. He admitted the
ability of the letter of Mr. Webster, which
was foriy days in preparation,'but denied
that it was an answer to the letter of Mr.
Fox: the instructions to Mr. Crittenden
were the answer; the letter was an argu
ment "for Buncombe,"' to justify and glaze
over by brave words the instructions, and
in proof of this, he said that Mr. Fox had
never taken the least notice of it. Hie con
eluded with a powerful appeal to the Ad
ministration to devote the revenues of the
nation to the public defences, instead ol
squandering them in schemes of distribu
tion, and investments in the stock of a Na
tional Bank.
In the House, Mr.~ Wise spoke for five
hours and a half on the subject of A bolition,
giving its history from the commencemeni
until the present, dealing some severe blows
to Mr. Adams, and some sharp hits to the
Speaker for the preponderance of. A boli
tionists on thse Committees. A t the con
efsion of his speech a vote was taken upori
his motion to reconsider the vote by which
the Committee to revise the rules was ap
pointed, and it was carried-ayes 106;
noes 104; and then the House, having un
done all, or nearly all, that has been done
in the way of organization, at about eighi
o'clock, adjourned.

GREEYvILLE, C. II. June 18. of
For more thtan two weeks past the weath- otl
or has been excessively warm and dry for lo.
the season, several days in succession,
at 3 o'clock P. M. the mercury rising as p
high as 90 degrees in the is.ade. On Tues- the
day night last we were visited by light at
showers, which were very much needed' ac
as vegetation was suffering considerably ei
from drought. Ti
The prospects for good crops in this sec
tion ofihe State were never more flatter- ait
ing. Wheat looks very fine, and some m
of our farmers have already commenced tb
harvesting. Oats have been injured by ne
the drought, but if we have a little more y
rain, there will he about an average crop. thb

formation of distant readers that for three ,
days we haie enjoyed a succession of co-. ce
pious and refreshing showers, replenishing in
our exhausted cisterns, and making glad
the face of vegetable nature ; and from ap- ce
pearances, we are induced to believe that
the imbriferous visitation has extended er
over the adjacent parishes, revivings the he
drooping cotton and thirsty corn,-Clar- -da
