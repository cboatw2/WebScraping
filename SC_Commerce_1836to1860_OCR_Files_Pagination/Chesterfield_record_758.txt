ity of our oditorials, as in supposing that c
we have intimated we would not support 81
Mr. Vnn Burcn, should the Democratic e
party prefer him as a candidate. It is as u
wide of the mark a* '.ne Charleston Courier ?
which, as its Want is, indulges a prepos- w
torous fancy, to wit: that if Mr. Cn-houn a
wcro out of tho way, our groat political
eneuiy, Henry Clay, could Mbe the second
choice" of South Carolina. We have no _
ill will to Mr. Cloy personally, but ho is '
politically anathema maranatha in this s
Stato forovor and forever. Wo do not ^
hold Mr. Van Buren to bo our enemy on ^
the slave question: we know that ho is
the friend, of the South on that question.
What wo complained of was thut any c
presses in his interest should be suffered
to assail Mr. Calhoun in such a proscriptive
and disorganizing spirit. Wo do not ^
beliovo that Mr. Van Buron instigated
those assaults or that he approves them.
Wo only hold him responsible for indo- ^
lently or indifferently allowing such nefarious
onslaughts to pass unrebuked when ^
made by his partizans, for whose insuborutuaiu
uiuuirncss uiiIvm k? ?..j iiis true ?

we have a reght to hold him amenable, c
Pledged to the Constitution, and hnving a
made good their pledges by their deeds, g
by votes in Congress on this very ti
slavery question, the Northern Democrats n
are the alios of tho South, from whom we j|
can never be divided, to make common c
cause with tho Whigs who are the natural n
allies of Abolition, making common cause
with it against the Constitution, which is
the shield of tho South. Should this at- P
tempt to proscribe instead of being put t(
down, bo encouraged nt the North even
to tho dividing of the Democratic party, o
tho Southern divison of it may be isolated, fi
but, euro ns fate, never can fall into the n

omocrats, in which an able report on se- i
ret combinations was made, accepted, t
nd ordered to be printed. Tho report v
ives tho following account of the prac- h
ices often resorted to by associations of s
ion acting secretly, with an understand- i?
ng among themselves, to turn political c
lections in some way to their private h
dvantnge: p

ly of n brief description. Their main P
bject of course is to fill every public of. n
ce with creatures of their own?with ?
ten whom they can manage. To effect 11
lis object they practice two simple arts n
('mysteries, viz :?1. The art of "making
uliticnl capital" for their instruments? ri
nd, 2. The art of "politically killing" ?
ny man who, from his talents, integrity M
nd weight of character, may be likely ?
> stand in their way. The first named
rt is practiced thus: After deciding in c
jcret conclave as to the individual to be
xnllcd, (generally selecting seme pliant, h
asy tempered soulf with as many ncgi: u
ve virtues as may be, and none o.hcr) a
io confederates go about to the different c
laces of public resort, everywhere casu.
lly remurking that Mr. Such-n-one is ^
ccoming quite popular?that they hear ?
im talked of very generally for such an P
(lice, and he will no doubt get the nomi.
ation, &c. They discuss his merits P
ith great apparent indifference and can- d
or?think on the whole he would bo a "
cry strong candidate?that he has many ^
lends who will be greatly dissatisfied, h
nd porhaps create a split, unless he is put ^
n tho ticket?and so on, according to s,
ircumslances and tho temper of the per- *
>n addressed. Soon the man actually
r talked of for the office by persons who c
o not see the collusion and have no con- e
ection with the conspirators; so what P
as n pretence at the start, becomes a re- "
lity in the end. Thus, while each citi- 0
en knows that so far as he is concerned. v
Ir. Such.it-one is at best an object of ut- n
;r indifference, he is led to suppose that v
te great hotly of the party are very anxtus
for his nomination. Each ono ac- P
ord iugly stifles his own views out of com- P
laisanco to the supposed partialities of 1
tc majority; while the real feelings of ^
Imost every individual in that majority ^
orrcspond exactly with his own. e
This farce is no less adapted to a large ?
icntre than a small one. For instance? c
ic Democracy of the city are industriusly
persuaded that Mr. A. (of whom 0
my know little or nothing) is the strong. r
it candidate for Governor?that all the ^
irming districts are excessively anxious 8
>r his nomination?and they therefore ?
ippress their preferences for Mr. B., F
horn they do know to be on able and usty
man for the station. Go among 1
trtners along the river, and you will find
mt tlie.y intend to support Mr. A. instead
f their favorite Mr. B. on account of his 8
rent popularity at the north and west. 0
a the northern nnd western counties, c
ou find they advocate Mr. A.'s nomina- n

on oui 01 complaisance 10 I tie southern n
er of counties, and (he spirited Demo, ti
rncy of the city, where they nrc told Mr.
is idolized by all classes. Each section r
so anxious to accoinmoduto itself to the ['
ipposcd preferences of other sections,
int the real preferences of all sections ^
ro Ucpl entirely out of sight. ^
While this process of creating n fac* j(
tious "public opinion" is going on, any (l
itizen detected in giving free utterance ?

allied by tho confederates, and branded

When n plinnn nr iiri.ln^fuou aPii

idden combination. The followinj
rief passage from the report, giving th
ymptoms of a political conspiracy, i
rorthy of attentive reflection :
"The existence of a political conspira
y may be established thus : All disintet
tted men, in selecting either u private c
ublic agent, invariably ask, is he honcsl
he capable ??and when free from an
vil design or unjust bias, they invariabl
ote for the mnn whom they think to b

srred in a republic upon one notoriousl
ishonest or incapable, the bare fact of bi

ount for the fact in any other way.'*
Neither the existence nor the tnischiel

nind the causes of this state of things an

That our present misfortunes arc th

In looking into the pnst history of tli
ountry, wo find that when Gen. Jackso
ook his scat in the Presidential Chair i
eon >.?/..?? a i. 1
\jwiiiiiivavoi ctiiiuirf nviil mill
ifttctiires, were nil in (he most nourishin
ondition. The Bank of (ho Unite
Itntea was in the full vigor of usefulnc?
ml the country wns blessed with the vci
est currency ever known in tho histoi
>f the world. The notes of Ihut ndmiri
>le Institution, wcro never more (linn on<
inlf of one per cent helow pnr in any pn
if this widely extended Union; und i
:onscquence the difference of exehan*
Kit ween any two extremes of this in
nenso country, never exceeded one.ha
if one per cent. The Traveller staitii
...
r>f ftonr Portland in Maine, had only to sup10
ply himself with U. S. Bank bills, and
10 with them ho could trovol to Now Orleans
!n without ever being troubled with a doubt
r_ as to the value of his currency. They
B were alwayB, every where nt par, except (
r for Iho purpose of deposito in Banks, when
bills on tire most distant Branches, could ,
1 bo converted into specio by the payment
of half per cent discount. Now, as wo
ld before said, tho woild never belore saw
y such an equalization in tho value of cur.
rency as existed at that period in the U> I
>t nitcd States, and which, but for bud legis)
lation and the most wicked management, i
i- would havo existed at this day. <
i- One of tho first objects of those who
j found themselves at Washington, nppen.
X* ded to the administration of Gen. Jnckson,
was to pcrpetuato the power they
had obtained. Thev wcro mostly a band
of uneducated adventurers, ignorant of 1
the world nod of Government, and fully <
prepared to illustrnte tho old adage?"put <
l.c a beggar on horseback, &c. ike." They I
Ir were out of position?a set of Goths and I
Vandals in tho midst of a civilization they <
53 could neither understand nor appreciate ; |
d and in their ignorance, they trifled with <
is Government somewhat after the fashion <
i, of monkics in u China shop, nnd witli the <
i. sarno result. They suw tho immense <
power nnd influence of the Bank of the I
r_ United States; but ignorant of tho deli- I
j cncy of the mechanism which kept that i
great machine in inuliun, they foolishly '
? su|>|)osed that it wns a species of pcrpetu- |
L" ul motion?n kind of national clock which <
i only required winding by official hands, c
to insure its running forever. Like cliil- I
18 dren gazing upon the steam engine, they t
e only saw its power without for a moment j
c dreaming of the absolute necessity of j
o keeping every portion of it in perfect or- I
>- der, to insure its working. In their igno- <
ranee and mad determination to retain <
|. power, they determined to seize upon t
u the Bank, nnd convert its power and i
0 patronage to the party purposes of the ad- t
j ministration. At this time Gen. Jack- j
son, Martin Van Buren, Isaac Hill, Bluir,
c Lewis, Kendall, and every man or demn- i
6 g?guo in and about the administration, >
" was in favor of the'Bank nnd determined t
upon its rc-chartur. Gen. Jackson and r
e Mr. Van Buren were so pre-eminently r
c its advocates, that both of them had ap. i
plied to Mr. Biddlc for nn increase of its
s Branches?Mr. Van Buren asking for one t
t at Albany, nnd Gen. Jackson seeking for e
. a Branch at Nashville. But we speak ?

' upon this subject, and as is well known, c
0 separated from them because thoy, ono and c

? to destroy the Bank the very moment that i

~ has bccomo history and susccptuhlo of i
'' proof. A long corrcs|)ondcnco followed <
between Air. Biddlc and Mr. Saml. I), i
fe Ingham; and if wo are properly advised ; t
b th.it gentlemnn has recently remarked <
'0 thnt lie looks back upon that period of his i
h public life as the only one lie would desire i
to bury in oblivion. <
. In this corresponcence Mr. Diddle was i
strong in his refusal to permit tho Govern- t
' ment to controul the nttiiirs of the Hank ; t
and then it was that tho Marals, the <
Danlons, and tho Sans Culolls who had <
followed in tho train of Gen. Jackson I
c when with his herd of Goths and Vandals <
it he took possession of the capitol, gravely <
ir determined they would destroy that which i
j. they could not controul and direct. Wo
n i will do them the justice to admit however, !
d that they knew not what they di.l. Ig- l
nornnt alike of everything connected with i
e monclory affairs, with commerce and with |
j. government, they vainly imagined that i
io the great and complicated innchino of i
ic government which they had seen work i
o so well, nnd apparently of its own volition,
l, would continue to accomplish its purpose.
9, They knew not, saw not, dreamed not,
y (hat there was any science in government;
n and that the commercial, the manufactur.
s. ing. nod the agricultural interests of the
country were all dependent upon a well j
io regulated currency. In their ignorance
n therefore, und to gratify their hutrcd of
in the honest and aide financier, whose far
i. seeing wisdom fortold the consequences
ig of intermeddling with tho currency, they
d gravely rushed upon the destruction of j
s, the Hank. Gen. Jackson however, could .
y not ho at onco controlled, lie was avow- i
y oil I y a Hank man ; and for years ufler, 1
a- lie continued to ailmit the usefulness and |
I). constitutionality of a National Hank, only
rt claiming (ho right of preparing its ruin
charter.
/? Wo need not follow the history of this :
ii. crusade against the Hank. Prominent
ill' among thexpedients for dispcncing with
ig a National Institution, way the citation ofi
o I
additional State Ranks with largo capitals.
Unfortunately for I he country, at that
period every Legislature in the country I
with one or two exceptions, was under tho
direction of Jacksonism ; and in conso- |
quoncr, when tho Globe called upon them
to crente new Ranks, they promptly responded
to tho call, and in ono year augmented
the nominal Ranking capital of
the country ono hundred and twenty-six ,
millions of dollars, and in two years, two
hundred and forty-four millions of dollars!
! And all this on the plea that it
was necessary to supply tho placo of tho
thirty millions of capital about to bo withdrawn
in winding up tho affairs of the National
Hank!
Tho intelligent render need not he told,
that the simple fact that Juckson Legislatures
had, in obedience to Jackson die- A
tat on, called into being upwards of four 9
hundred and forty million of Banking
Capital, did not nild to the actual weaith ^
or capital of the country one dollar. But
this immense number of Banks having
been created, and capital diverted from |
other sources to put them in operation, it I
followed of course, that they must loan
out their money or they could not make
jivmcnus. nut 11 will naruiy do contended
that the creation of new banks will
create new business. Here were two
hundred and forty million of additional <
banking capital seeking employment, but
no additional business created by it.
SVhnt then ? Why a struggle ensued bewcen
these banks to find borrowers; and
is mankind are p.one to use money when
>ffcrcd to them, borrowers wero found;
nit then followed another struggle beween
the borrowers to find the means of
nrolitably employing the sums borrowed.
Vs we before remarked, the legitimate
nisiness of tho country could not be in:rcascd
by the increase of banks ; and of
rourse, speculation in public lunds, and
:vcry conceivable species of property,
ivas the consequence, followed by tho exruvagance
which this state of things engendered.
We pauso hero, and enquire of every
:andid, intelligent man of both parties,
vhethcr these are not well established hisorical
facts? They most certainly are ;
ind in times like tho present, should bo
ecultcd to mind and calmly pondered
jpon.
During the fictitious state of things
tins created, and the wild speculations
ind extravagance thus fostered, tho
Jtntcs, governed by individuals among
vhom this mania existed, undertook to
Icvelopo too rapidly their latent resources
ind become borrowers in the European
narkots of very large amounts. Their
redit was undoubted ; and offering six
ir seven per cent, interest while the Govirnmcnts
of Europe paid but three or four,
t is not to he wondered at that foreign
:api(nl flowed naturally in this direction.
The British Ministry found their pcrmalent
Stock rapidly falling in value, and
he buyers of their Exchequer Bills as ra>idly
diminishing; and tho greatest aarm
xas the very natural consequence.
I'hey saw very plainly, that if the credit
>f our States continued unimpaired, and
tur country prosperous, their three per
:cnts would fall to fifty, and ull new loans
voulu necessarily be at tho rate of inter.
;st paid by our States. Destruction
hercforc, stared them in the face ; nnd in
lotf-defence, they determined through the
tank of England, to strike a blow at
Vmcricun credit. That blow come when
rast expected ; but even then hnd our
Government acted wisely, its too fatal
:onsequenccs might have been foreseen
ind avoided. But instead of this?in.
tcad of legislating to sustain tho com.
nerce and credit of the country-?the cry
>f44 Perish credit?perish commerco" was
lont forth under the auspices of Mr. Van
durcn, a deadly wurfuro was waged
igninst the very Banks which Jackson,
sin and Van Burcnism had called into
icing; and while the Bank of Englnnd
it the instigation of the British Govern,
nent, struck us a blow on tho other side
>f tho water, Van Burcn and bis statclites
nstead of repelling, gave it full force on
bis. Instcnd cf repealing the Specie Cir.
:ular which Jackson in his ignorance had
issued, and thus enabling the Banks to
neet the blow levelled at the credit of the
country, he proclaimed that "all whotra.
led on horiowcu capital ought to fail,"
md left us exposed to the mighty crusade
waged for tho very existence of English
credit. It was a wur of fearful odds. On
ine side was the Bank of England backed
>y Iho British Government und every inlividuul
inlerrcsted in her enormous debt;
r?n tho other, tho American merchant, nnd
I lie thousand nnd one Stute Banks of the
Union. The Oovconment of tho United
States held in its hands the power to doIcrmino
the result. In whichever scald
Ihey threw their influence?to whichever
party they give their support?thoy ensured
the victory. But alas for American
credit, American prosperity, and AinerU
can patriotism! Vnn Burcn and his satalitcs
thought only of themselves. lie and
(hey had seen with how little (rouble a
whole people may he governed, if once
crushed to (he earth by (ho operation of u
hard-money system. He pointed (o (wenty-one
hard monied government* whero
the people were uncomplaining and satislied,
because ground to dust by starvation
and oppression. lie determined to rule
by breaking the spirit of the people; and
gravely and fiendishly determined, that
the Government should not sustain tho
credit of tho country, hut tlint all should
? perish" as his friend had proclaimed
from his scat in Congress, and the prosperity
and happiness of the people ho offered
up ut the* shrine of his hard-money
doctrine, in short, ho decided against
his country, Iiih countrymen, mid tho
credit of the States, and in favor of England
and the English capitalists; and we
are now reaping the awful consequence'!!
oi liis want of jt.iti iuiism.
