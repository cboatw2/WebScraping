CLASS MEETING.—NO. VII.
We propose, now, as briefly as the impor
tance of the subject will admit, to state and an
swer some of the most common, and prominent
objections to class meetings. Many of these
objections are weak, and, in reality, unreasona
ble. It has often been urged, and by persons too,
who ought to know better: _•*'
1. That, “class meetings bear a striking re
semblance to auricular confession in the Romish
Church." This objection is doubtless more
seeming than real. Let us examine it a little.
The church of Rome not only requires confes
sion to a priest, as a duty, but, has advanced it
to the dignity of a sacrament. These confes
sions are made in private to the priest, who is not
to reveal them under pain of the highest pun
ishment The council of Trent requires “se
cret confession to the priest alone, of all and
every mortal sin, which upon the most diligent
search and examination of our consciences, we
can remember ourselves to be guilty of, since our
baptism; together with all the circumstances of
those sins, which may change the nature of
’ them; because without the perfect knowledge of
these, the priest cannot make a judgment of the
nature, and quality of men's sin’s nor impose
future penance for them.” To one, who has
ever met in class, or who has a correct theoreti
cal knowledge of them, it will appear evident,
that, there is, in truth, no resemblance of, or ap
proach to this Romish usage. (1.) Rome makes
confession a sacrament, and endeavours to sub
stantiate the assumption by a resort to scriptural
argument r we do not pretend to make class
meeting a sacrament, nor do we attempt to prove
from scripture, that, such an institution was in
existence in the days of the apostles, and received
their approbation and encouragement; but, we
do contend, that, there are very many passages
of scripture, and there were many customs
among the Old and New Testament saints,
which seem very strongly to favour such an in
stitution. (2.) Rome requires it to be made in se
cret tothe priest alone, who is not-allowed “un
der pain of the highest punishment” to reveal it;
not even to a brother priest: in class, there are
generally from six to twelve persons at least;
sometimes twenty or even thirty,' and what is
said by the leader, and by each individual, is
heard by all these persons, and none, neither the
leader, or the members are under any obliga
tions whatever, to keep secret the sayings and
doings of the meeting: on the contrary, they are
often made topics of profitable religious conver
sation afterward. In the Discipline, page 89
we have a permission given to such as are not
members of our church ; even to objectors, if they
wish to form an acquaintance, so as to judge of
them by actual experience. It is as follows:
“ Section iv. Of the privileges granted to
serious persons, who are not of our church.
Question 1. How often shall we permit tnose
who are not of our church to meet in class 1
Answer. At every other meeting of the class
in every place let no stranger be admitted. At
other times they may; but, the same person not
above twice or thrice.” We would ask the grave
objector, if there is any thing here that looks
like Romish confession, or even has a squinting
that way 1 Every unprejudiced mind will re
spond, there is nothing.
(3.) Rome requires a confession of all and
every mortal sin, with all the attendant circum
stances, &.c. &c.; in class meeting a simple
statement of the religious state, prospects, hopes,
&c. is required, followed by a suitable exhorta
tion to diligence, and steadfastness.
(4.) Rome requires a diligent search of the
conscience and memory, and a confession of all
sin, since baptism, to the priest, who is there to
judge of the nature and quality of those offences,
and prescribe appropriate penance in order to
gain absolution: none of this ever takes place in
a class room; the leader does not Tequire his
members to make confession of sin to him, nor
does he prescribe a penance. He directs the
penitent, to “the Lamb of God, who alone taketh
away the sin of the world and assures them,
that, “ with the heart man believeth unto right
eousness ; and with the mouth confession is
made unto salvation.”
2. It is objected, “there is no positive scrip
ture precept for class meeting.” _ We answer
(1.) There is no scripture against it. There is
not a single passage in all the Bible that con
demns it. <2.) There is much scripture for it,
even all tnose texts which enjoin the substance
of those various duties whereof this is only an
indifferent circumstance, to be determined by
reason and experience. (3.) It must be observed,
that the scripture, in most points, gives general
rules; and leaves the particular circumstances to
be adjusted by the common sense of mankind.
The scripture, for instance, gives that general
rule, “let all things be done decently and in or
der.” But common sense is to determine, on
particular occasions what order and decency re
quire. So in another instance the scripture lays
it down as a general, standing direction;
“ whether ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do
all to the glory of God." But it is common pru
dence which is to make the application of this,
in a thousand particular cases. Let us go a lit
tle further and see, where the principle of this
objection, if fully carried out, will lead us.—
Where, we ask, is the scripture precept, which
enjoins upon females the duty or even offers them
(he privilege df partaking or thh Hmy Sstft'a*
ment of the Lord’s supper f There is none to i
be found, and yet the common sense of every
man teaches him that females, as well as males,
have a right to, and are in duty bound to wait
on God, in this holy ordinance of his church.
So then, an argument or objection which proves
too much, is as weak, as if it proved too little.
So say we.
3. “ But these are all the inventions of men.”
This is but the same objection in another form;
and the same answer will suffice for any rea
sonable person. These are man’s inventions;
and what then ? That is, they are methods
which men have found out by reason and com
mon sense, for the more effectually applying
several scripture rules, couched in general terms,
to particular occasions.
4. It is often urged, “class meeting is an ad
dition to the standing laws of our divine Re
deemer.” One remark on this point will suf
fice. There is no system of church discipline
laid down in the Bible j the scripture, in most
points, and in this especially, gives general rules;
leaving the good sense of the people, and out
ward circumstances to dictate what particular
rules and regulations are necessary for their
peace, and safety as a church. Fora full refu
tation of this objection, consult the first part of
our fifth number.
5. Some say u we would like to be m a chris
tian society, if all the members were as good as
they should be." But, if such persons never be
come members of the church of God, until pro
fessors are all as good as they should be, they
are certainly placing themselves in an awful sit
uation : one which involves the interests of both
worlds. They might, with as much show of
reason say, that they should like to be in busi
ness, if all the men in the world were honest
men; or if there were no base money in circu
lation. The existence of some formalists in the
church of Christ is no reason why we should
not seek in the use of the appointed means, to be
of the true “circumcision, who worship God in
the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have
no confidence in the flesh.” Because there are
some hypocrites, is that any reason why we
should not be sincere Christians ? There were
bad people in the church in the days of our
Lord, and of his Apostles; and he has given us
an assurance in the parable of the tares and the
wheat, as well as in many other places, that this
will be the case, even unto the end of the world;
and do or say what we may, we cannot help it,
or find a remedy for the evil. “ Let them both
grow together until the harvest” is the divine
direction. So then this objection, however plau
sible it may appear, will not hold good.
5. Some ask, when closely exhorted and
warned, “can we not go to heaven without being
in society ?” If this objection be levelled against
class meetings, we are ready to admit, that per
sons may go to heaven without ever meeting in,
or knowing any thing about them; but, if by it
be meant “can we not go to heaven without
being members of the church on earth ? we say,
it is barely possible, but, hardly probable. But
we would ask such people, whether they would
like to be without society in Heaven? Have
those any right to expect that they shall be num
bered with the saints of God in glory everlasting
who aTe unwilling to be numbered with his
saints on earth ? It is the duty of every man
who would save his soul to be united with some
religious body of people. Let a man make his
choice; but, he must choose, or he refuses to
confess Christ before men; and cannot reasona
bly hope to be acknowledged by him when he
comes in judgment. It is as much our duty
to profess faith, as it is to possess it; to be use
ful to others, as we would wish they should be
useful to us, in working out our salvation. Oh
how many of the children of Methodist parents
are sinning against the clearest light and con
viction ! They know they ought to give them
selves to God after the example of their parents ;
but they do not. A gentleman, who had been
brought up in the bosom of Methodism, once said
to a lady, when she was exhorting him to be
decided, and become a member of the society,
“ what, do you think that persons cannot go to
heaven without being members of the Methodist
Society?" In answer to this inquiry, she said,
“ Sir, others may; but, I fear you cannot." This
fear was founded on the persuasion, that he was
neglecting what he knew to be both a religious
duty and a privilege. There are no doubt
many, very many in this same condition ; and
yet they can sit under the Methodist ministry and
hear from year to year of the necessity of coming
out from the world and of holding communion
with God’s people, and still continue without the
fold, halting between two opinions ! Many of
these persons know that they are not in the way
to heaven. They are ready to acknowledge,
that it would be a help to them to be in a Chris
tian society ; but, they are unwilling to give up
something which keeps them back. O let such
persons reflect seriously, and consider how they
will answer for their convictions, if they continue
to neglect the salvation of their souls. There
are several other objections which, for want of
space in this, we shall beg leave to submit in
another article; and then, we purpose dismiss
ing the subject. L. S.

From the Weatem Christian Advoasts.
THE SCHOOL-MASTER OF THE NINE
TEENTH CENTURY,—NO. I.
The tendencies of the age, the political as
pect of the earth, and the social and moral con
dition of the inhabitants of its different countries,
connected as they necessarily are with the various
institutions established for the advancement of
religion, the diffusion of education, and the ex
tension of commerce, form the exclusive subjects
of contemplation that come under the head we have
here assumed. A careful review of the subjects
mentioned is at all periods advantageous, and at
none more so than when society, as at present,
is in a transition state,—when long established
maximsare rapidly being unsettled, and old forms
of political and social government are yielding
to the healthful and vigorous workings of new
principles which are now unfolding themselves.
The first great axiom in political ethics is that
society never remains stationary,—that it is ai
rways ■ either advancing or retrograding,—that
however imperceptible it may be, there is always
a change taking place. And I shall contend
that in the economy of nature, although society
in single countries may retrograde, yet the moral
and social condition of man, as a whole, is al
ways improving; and although a change for the
worse may for a short time apparently take place,
UjM Wry rttwgb tfvbtrtoMW in increasing the
onward motion of society,—that as in the ma
terial world vegetation springs up rankest and
strongest from amid dead ana decaying matter,
so in the moral world noble and life-giving
principles rise purer and stronger from amid the
general deay and corruption of society. It was
the oppression of the nobles which gave rise to
municipalities, which contained in themselves the
germs of future freedom: it was to the selling of
indulgences and the universal corruption of the
clergy, that the Reformation owed its birth; and
undoubtedly the rapid progress of.the Christian
religion itself was owing, in some measure, to
the fact that the worship of heathen divinities
had degenerated «nto mere hypocrisy, and the
priests of their idols were no more true believers
but impostors, practising upon the superstitions
of a corrupt and ignorant and often incredulous
crowd.
It will be our object, as much as possible, to
treat the several distinct branches of the subject
separately; but they are so interwoven with each
other in their mutual relations of cause and effect,
that it will be absolutely necessary to regard
them in some measure as a whole. It may be
here premised that in all ages and countries forms
of government and great events are, for the most
part, merely the reflex of public mind,—that
these events are only the floating masses upon the
great tide of the world’s opinion, which shows
us in which direction that tide sets; and the fact
of things happening contrary to this general
tendency no more disproves the power or effect
of the mighty current of opinion, than does the
existence of counter currents in a stream show
that the main one will not bear matters floating
upon it alone in its own direction. Nevertheless,
care must be taken to distinguish those events
which are attributable to the mental tendency of
a particular class from those which are attributa
ble to the world’s great mass.
x iic iiisi jjucuirariiy oi me muuieciuii century,
which will strike the most common observer, is
the general spirit of inquiry which pervades
nearly all classes of society,—a striving after
something that is hidden and unknown,—a long
ing for the light. This spirit manifests itself in
all departments of science,—in agriculture, in
manufactures, and in commerce. The wonder
ful discoveries in mechanics maybe regarded as
the miracle of the nineteenth century: new
powers of nature are daily discovered, and new
applications of old powers are daily made. In
agriculture a new spirit is developing itself: it is
no longer an object of mere manual labor, but
of deep philosophical inquiry. In those bran
ches to which the term science is particularly
applied, discoveries have been made of so won
derfula nature as to really assume theairof fiction.
A fairy world has been revealed to view, and
poetry and romance of the imagination become
dull and tasteless beside the poetry and romance
of fact: truth comes to us clothed in a strange
garb: the astonishing and the marvelous are
matters of every day life.
But if the spirit of inquiry of the present day
marks itself in splendid discoveries, it is no less
strikingly exemplified by the novel sects and
wild theories in which our age is so fertile.
Fourierism and Neurology, Mormonism and
Millerism, spring up and flourish in the same
soil with science and literature. In politics and
religion, men examine the truth of the most re
vered maxims: the surplice and the robe are no
longer guarantees of the thruth of the doctrine;
and a Pope and a Wesley must contend on the
same arena with the same weapons: the hum
blest subject dare gaze upon the sceptre and the
crown, and demand the meaning of the toys, or
the title of the wearer. To account for the
prevalence of this spirit of free inquiry, it is
necessary to go far back, even to the commence
ment of the Reformation. At that time enter
prise in commerce had already exhibited itself
among those nations bordering upon the Mediter
ranean ; and as to other subjects in some parts of
Europe men were beginning to awake from a
long mental lethargy. Under these circumstan
ces j-.uiner, disgusted at tne depravity ot the
Popish Church, broke loose from his old belief
ana prejudices, and set in motion the stagnant
world of mind which had so long been resting
that its energy and power were almost lost.
Men first began to seek the foundation of their
old faith; and this question became more and
more general with each year. They found that
they had believed without reason,—had been the
dupes of cunning and wily priests,—that they
had vainly imagined themselves safe anchored
to a rock which could never fail, and now, like
vessels broken from their moorings without rud
der and without compass, involved in darkness
and night, they were driving about upon a deep
and shoreless ocean. Many deceived once had
learned to doubt every thing: hence, were
atheis.s and infidels; and hence, too, that distrust
ful character which arose,and, increasing as the
Reformation spread, is not even yet extinct. But
doubt is not the element of the human soul: it
must have a faith on which to feed, or it will
die: it must have some belief to which to attach
itself, or it can never be at rest. This men have
felt; and, deprived of their old faith, have striven
to look through the mist and darkness surround
ing them,—have grasped at each form which
promised the object of their desire; and, baffled
in one effort, would renew it again. Thus arose
the spirit of inquiry in religious matters ; and,
once existing, it spread from object to object,
leaving nothing unattempted or untried, groping
its way with untiring curiosity into the loneliest
and darkest labyrinth of science. This spirit
.hasdethroned kings, unsettled empires, and over
turned dynasties; this too has built up new
dynasties, and established new thrones,—has
founded new empires, and introduced great and
new principles into forms of government. It
has opened the doors of dungeons, and broken
the chain of the serf It has established the em
I pire of mind over brute force, and has vindicated
j the rights and maintained the equality of man.
! Its name is plunged on every wave: its monu
i ments are planted on every shore. It has pene
trated the north, to where the pole star stands in
the zenith: it has searched the south, to where
eternal winter has piled up her ice mountains
against it. It is working in mountain and in
cave, in air and in water, and it will continue to
I work, building up and pulling down, giving life
to new systems and destroying old ones,
j It has often been remarked, that this is pecu
liarly an age of error and of humbug. It may
be so ; but it is peculiary an age of truth too.
If half of the learned world have been gulled
by a story of discoveries in the moon, that same
learned world has been astonished by actually
seeing Europe brought within twelve day's sail
of Amerfeu. If Mftrmonism has inottuttl with
unexampled rapidity, so has also the number of
those who believe in the Bible, not from preju
dice, or habit, but from careful study and thorough
examination. If agrarianism on the one side,
and royalism on the other, are advocating doc
trines destructive to the peace and welfare of
society, the great mass of the people never be
fore so thoroughly understood the true theory of
government, or were so determined in their sup
port of it. Their very errors are, in many re
spects, the result of a striving after truth. Men
cried for light, and a light was given them,
throwing its rays into the midst of darkness,
dim, feeble, and flickering, it is true, but still a
light. Many might be unable to see by it, and
stumble in the way. Many may follow an ignis
fatuus light of their own making; yet they are
animated by the same spirit, a desire to search
out reality. And thus it is with us in this great
world: with the eye strained and the hand
stretched out we toil on.
To enter into the particulars of the effect of
this spirit would protract our article to too great a
length: the final consideration of it will be re
served for a later number.
CHINA EVANGELIZED.
BY J. MONTGOMERY.
Ye armies of the living God,
Hia sacramental host t
Where hallowed footsteps never trod,
Take your appointed post.
Follow the cross,—the ark of peace
Accompany your path;
To slaves and rebels bring release,
From bondage and from wrath.
Tho’ few and small, ar.d weak your hands,
Strong in your Captain’s strength,
Go to the conquest of all lands,—
All must be his at length.
The closet seal’d between the poles
Is open’d to your toils;
Where thrice a hundred million souls
Are offered for your spoils.
Those spoils, at his victorious feet,
You shall rejoice to lay;
And lay yourselves, as trophies meet,
In his great judgment day.
No carnal weapons those ye bear,
To lay the aliens low;
Then strike amain, and do not spare,—
There’s life in every blow.
Life 1—more than life on earth can be;
All in this conflict slain,
Die but to sin,—eternally
The crown of life to gain.
O fear not, faint not, halt not now;
Quit you like men; be strong;
To Christ shall Buddhu’s votaries bow,
And sing with you this song.
“ Uplifled are the gates of brass;
The bars of iron yield;
Behold the King of Glory pass;
The Cross hath won the field.”
PARENTAL FIDELITY REWARDED.
Christian faithfulness in the performance of
duty in any relation of life, is sure to be reward
ed. It is never overlooked or forgotten by the
great Witness and Judge of human actions. But
it must not be imagined that fidelity in the ser
vice of Christ is a meritorious ground of favor;
yet, of his infinite grace he is pleased to connect
with it an exceeding great reward. The heav
enly gift may not, perhaps, be observed by the
world. It may be the peace “that passeth un
derstanding,” or it may be deferred. There are,
however, cases in which God is pleased to give
sensible and impressive demonstrations of His
grace, in rewarding the faithful labours of his
servants. We subjoin an instance of the kind
from an authentic narrative of great interest,
now before us.
About fifty years ago, a young woman in
London, whom we call Miss M., became the
wife of a man engaged in mercantile pursuits.
She had been reared by pious parents, who en
deavored to impress upon her mind the lessons
of the gospel. Their efforts were accompanied
by those of the Rev. William Romaine, a pious
minister of the Established Church, who often
conducted a religious service at their house.—
Miss M. was accustomed to be present at these
sacred exercises, but her attendance was, per
haps, in obedience to parental authority, or from
respect to her minister, for she then felt no in
terest in these hallowed seasons of instruction.
“ Gladly would she have escaped,” had she been
permitted, from the uncongenial element with
which, on these occasions, she was surrounded.
With the best advantages for receiving the
knowledge of God and salvation, she grew up
with a decided aversion to spiritual religion.—
Having arrived at mature years she forms a con
nection for life,—and leaves the abode of her
pious parents, without God and without hope in
the world.
The parents, perhaps, were ready to exclaim,
—“ Alas! we have laboured in vain! Our
prayers for this child,—and our instructions,
have been thrown away!" Is not the Christian
parent, who thus sees a beloved child commen
cing life, w’ith a heart alive to the pleasures of
the world and alienated from God, tempted to
reproach himself, that he has not been more
faithful in his efforts to promote the salvation of
his family? Does not the Christian mother
sometimes distrust the faithfulness of the divine
promise, when witnessing the matured wayward
ness of an impenitent daughter ? Judge nothing
before the time. These sacred lessons, to which
Miss M gave an unwilling ear, were not lost.
Soon after her marriage, Miss M. (for so we
still designate her,) removed with her husband to
Oxford. Having been reared under the influ
ence of the Episcopal ministry, her early habits
led her to the parish church. But there she
could not hear the same evangelical preaching to
which she had been accustomed to listen under
the ministry of Mr. Romaine. Though desti
tute of piety, her education had disqualified her
for relishing the ethical discourses of a ministry
that knew nothing of “ Christ and Him cruci
fied." In pursuit of her object she visited in
succession the different churches of that celebra
ted city, in which her habitation had been fixed.
She had no desire to leave the Episcopal Church,
for she was attached to its rites and forms by all
the prejudices of education and habit. But
[aradngR this Episfetfphl clergy of Oxford die
■ . - > i. u .n
doctrines preached by Romaine were under in
terdict. Convinced that she could not there
hear the truth, and finding that evangelical doc
I trines were taught by the Nonconforming min
' istry, she reluctantly withdrew from the Esta
, blishment, and became a regular attendant in a
| Congregational Church.
This was the first important result of her reli
| gious education. In this church “ the truths to
i which she listened were applied by the Holy
| Spirit with power to her heartand they gave
I a new form to her character. The prayers of
| her parents are now answered. Their daughter
! has become a child of God, and has commenced
j a life of consistent piety.
I Soon after her husband was induced to remove
! to London, where she was occupied with the
care and instruction of her children. In the
hallowed circle around her was a little son whom
they called 11 John" an affectionate lad, whose
mind was always active, and often seemed im
pelled by restless desire to investigate subjects
which were unnoticed by other children. His
advantages for instruction at school were exceed
ingly limited, but he enjoyed the far more im
portant privilege of a religious education. This
was conducted by his mother. As she did not
have the co-operation of a partner like mind
ed with herself, her’s was no ordinary task.
When both parents are pious, they meet with
formidable difficulties in training up a child in
the nurture and admonition of the Lord. How
much more discouraging is the great work,
when the mother is left to perform it alone I
Yet it must not be neglected. By maternal
affection, mild firmness, and consistent piety she
secures the ascendency over the minds of her
children. Morning and evening she leads them
to her chamber for instruction and prayer.
There, as she daily commends them to the God
of all grace, they witness her pious solicitude
for their salvation. Thus, by scriptural instruc
tion and prayer, she makes impressions on their
susceptible minds, which no subsequent scenes
can efface. At first, indeed, she did not reap
where she had sown. Her instructions ana
prayers saved her son from open vice and im
morality. But she saw in his disposition no
promise of early piety.
in pursuing ner solitary course oi parental
fidelity, many, no doubt, were her anxieties.
No record remains of the depression, and dis
couragement, and fear which marked her men
tal history as she saw her son growing up to
manhood, “ a lover of pleasure more than a lover
of God.” At the age of 14 he left the parental
roof, an indentured apprentice in the business to
which his father destined him. A mother’s
thoughts and prayers still follow him in the pla
ces of temptation to which he is now exposed.
Hardened by his intercourse with the world, if
he frequents the sancturay, it is to gratify a pious
I mother. And if he is not flagrantly vicious, he
“ oftens scofls at the name of Christ and his reli
| "ion.” Unpromising youth i Did faith and
| hope sustain the spirit of your Christian mother
through this dark period of your early life?
Perhaps she little thought that her pious toil
wou Id ever be rewarded. There was apparently
nothing in prospect for her son, but an irreli
gious life, devoted supremely to self and the
world, and an unbeliever’s death bed and dodm.
But God is not unmindful of her labor of love
toward Him. Her prayers and tears are “ a
memorial” before the throne of grace. Her
thoughtless son, who had reached his 19th year,
was loitering in the streets one Sabbath evening,
waiting for his giddy companions to accompany
him to a tavern. While thus sauntering, he is
recognized by a pious lady, who, with much im
portunity, persuades him to go with her to the
house of God. That was a memorable night to
the young trifler, who had been reluctantly di
verted from a tea party at a tavern. The solemn
inquiry, “ What shall a man give in exchange
for his soul?" was accompanied to his heart by
the Spirit of the Almighty, revealing the infinite
purport and extent of the interrogatory. The
prayers of his pious mother are now answered.
The heart and life of her son are devoted to the
cause of Christ. And she now enjoys the re
ward of her toils in contemplating the fruits
of the life and ministry of John Williams, the
Apostle of Polynesia, whose energetic, patient,
and enterprising labors in spreading the gospel
among ten thousands of the heathen, have given
the Church a character which God and men will
honor for ages to come. The remembrance of
his name is fragrant, and it will inspire future
missionaries with hallowed and intrepid zeal in
the service of Christ.—Christian Observer.
INFIDELITY—DR. CHALMERS.
The following eloquent and searching appeal
of Dr. Chalmers may reach some skeptital mind
which might never come into contact with the
original work:—
“ Is there at the very outset enough of likeli
hood that God might be the author of this book,
as should resolve us upon a serious examination.
Then, if God actually be the author, we have
not acquired the knowledge of him we might
have done; and we shall be condemned accord
ingly, if we withhold the examination which
ought to have been given. Is there enough of
the character of the Divinity stamped upon its
pages, that, had we only read with earnestness,
and pondered with earnestness, we would have
beheld the traces of Him distinctly there, and
been satisfied; then if, instead of so reading, we
have wantonly and ignorantly reviled it, God
may righteously step forth and vindicate upon
our persons the truth of his insulted message,
and the honesty of his insulted messengers. If
the suspicion has ever come into our hearts, that
this ridicule of Scriptu.e may after all be ridicule
of the Almighty; and you, instead of being ar
rested by the impulse of such a visitation, have
in the mad outcry of a great and grievous infat
uation, made your strenuous effort to keep down
this compunction of feeling, and have prevailed,
then you have committed yourselves, and that
willfully, to the hazards of this alternative, that
either the Scriptures are a fable, or you by the
choice of your own hearts and the deed of your
own hands have come under all the curses that
are written in it. Certain it is, that to whatever
terms, of whatever alternative, the world may
commit itself in reference to Christianity, Chris
tianity commits itself to a very distinct alterna
tive in reference to the world; and if this religion
be indeed true, and such be the actual influence
of the human will upon the human understand
ing, that he who is willing to do God's will

from God; and if kith in the Gospel be at all

j and sincerely in quest of what is right; ana if
I the spirit of direction be given to him who has
an upright feeling of desire to do as he ought,
and to believe as he ought; and if every man
who faithfully follows the light of hi* conscience,
is thereby conducted to a reverence for his Bible;
and if infidelity be at all times the fatal product •
of a heart careless about Qod, and utterly un
concerned either to retain such a knowledge of
him as it has, or to acquire such knowledge of
him as it has not, then it may not be in the power
of a fellow man, under all these guises of can- •
dour, and frankness and liberality, which the un
t believer can put on, so to feel his way through
the intricacies of another’s spirit as to catch the
lurking criminality, and bring it out in satisfying
exposure to the general eye. But let Christian
ity be true,and mark the fearful alternative to him
that spurns it away. The unseen author of it
ponders every heart, and mysterious as its work
ings are to us, there is nothing in them 911 that
can baffle the scrutiny of Him who formed it;
and if there be, as the Bible says there is, an
alliance between infidelity and moral evil, He
can detect it and bring it out on the day of reck
oning to open manifestation. He can unveil the
whole process of this Unreasonable delusion,
j and at every step of it, where pride, or ungodli '
| ness, or selfishness or proflgacy did operate its
bias upon the understanding. He can make it
good, and that to the conviction of the unhappy
man, that his judgment was in error just because
his affections were in error, that there was a want
of belief in his mind just because there was a
want of worth in his character, that he was not
a Christian because he was not an upright man,
and that the light that was in him was turned
| into darkness,because he did not care to retain it;
and after it was lost he did not care and did not
chose to recover it”
RUSSIAN WORSHIP.
The Russian worship resembles in several re
spects that of popery; for it is filled with a mul
titude of superstitious practices. The atten
dants make, during the performance of mass,
numberless genuflexions and signs of the cross.
No people seek more the blessing of the priests
| than the Russians. They call upon the priests
to bless the house they build, the ground they
till, their flocks, their harvests, all they do, all
they attempt On the 6th of August of every
[ year, the churches are filled with apples and
pears which the priests bless. Till then no true
believer would dare to eat these fruits. But as
soon as the ceremony is ended, all pounce upon
the baskets consecrated by the priests. On the
6th of January, the rivers and streams are bless
ed. The priest approaches with much pomp to
the bank, cuts out a hole in the ice, and plunges
the cross three times into it, reciting some pray
ers. Immediately the women run with their
pitchers to draw this consecrated water; the men
drink large draughts. The struggle for tumblers,
bottles, &,c. lasts for several hours. A fountain
of wine, flowing in one of our public squares,
on a national festival, would not excite more
eagerness. Poor people, how much they need
to have the Bible in their hands, to be freed from
such gross superstitions!
The churches are very richly ornamented: in
those of the chief cities, especially, are found
the accumulated treasures of many generations.
They contain,—not sculptures, for the Greek
church forbids them,—but innumerable paintings
The large churches are filled with old dingy
picures, where only the hands and face are visi
ble ; all the rest covered with silver, gold, sap
phires, rubies, emeralds. Before each of these
pictures are hung silver lamps which are lighted
on feast-days. The people offer candles to be
burned in honor of the saints ; there are candles
of all prices and for every rank of life; the
church sells them, and makes a large profit.
The most splendid part of the church is call
ed the iconostace. It is a gallery of paintings,
at the bottom of the nave in an enclosure with
three doors. The priest alone is allowed to en
ter through the middle door. There is collected
all that is most magnificent and most dazzling.
On high days, the treasures of the church are
opened, and exposed to the eager eyes of the
Russians, who expect from them great blessings.
I would not forget to say that the Muscovite
church recognizes no other saints than those
which were canonized before the Eastern schism.
New saints cannot be created ; but the emperor
may himself, by a decree, create what are called
the Blessed: a sort of intermediate class be
tween the ancient saints and ordinary men. Ah!
how is the heart of the Christian saddened and
rent, when he sees such degradation in beings
who still invoke the name of Christ!—For. Cor.

THE POPE AND THE PENINSULA.
The following paragraph in the Univers
manifests the point of view in which the Papal
See regards all political movements:
“ The face of things in the peninsula is chang
ed; Spain has reconquered the right and the
power to return into a right tray, and at the
same moment the reconciliation of Portvgal to
the Holy See is perfected. The Patriarch of
Lisbon has received the Cardinal’s hat from the
Queen, and at the same time the Bishop of Lis
bon was consecrated. The administration of
this rite to the Archbishop of Beagu, and the
Bishops of Oporto, Beja, and the Algerias, was
to follow within a few days.”
How soon Ireland ana England may return
into a right way, who shall tell 1 How soon a
Puseyite patriarch shall receive a cardinal’s hat,
or Daniel O’Connell, become grand inquisitor,
may be difficult to calculate. But there is no
difficulty in seeing what they all drive at.
THE NEW SCOTCH CHURCH.
The numbers of the new movement are rap- W
idly increasing, too much so, perhaps for its “
means. Dr. Chalmers, who is now at the head
of the body, has addressed a letter to an Irish
clergyman, which states the following facts:—
“ In regard to the extent of our actual need,
it is impossible to represent it in terms sufficiently
strong. The cause of the Free Church has
grown upon our hands beyond all calculation.
Besides the congregations of our out-going min
isters, 470 in number, others are starting up on
all sides in moderate parishes, and all alike are
imploring for the means of sheltering themselves
before the approach of winter. There cannot
be fewer than 800 churches requiring at the
