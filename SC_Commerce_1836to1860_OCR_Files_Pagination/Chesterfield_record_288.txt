ut as the taste of the King, and consequeny
of his eourtiefSy was fixed on the heavy
lormao horses, the lighter ferns of the
sautiful Barbary horses were looked upon
ith disdain. They were, besides, very
ciousand unmanageable, except in the
inds orihe slaves that accompanied them
om Tunis., -They were consequently emtoyed
in the most menial offices, and were
)on disposed o nt mere nominal prices to
,iv one that would ; take them. Scham,

dieting upon him in the streets of Paris*
f a benevolent English Quaker, who took
ie horse and his mute attendant, who bad
Jhered to tl>e fortunes of bis favorite horse
irough usage scarcely leas revolting than
cham had received, to bis residence near
ondon.
The horse had contracted a fondness for
cat while in Paris, and grimalkin was his
mutant attendant in the stable, climbing
>on his buck and resting there, evidently
uch to the satisfaction of both. Agbu,
he mute,) the cat and Scham, were inseouble
companions, and together took up
eir residence in the Quaker's stables.
HereSchum manifested some of apparidy
vicious and wild qualities, refusing to>
low any one to_ mount_him but Agbfe, and
most killing Dr. Harrison, the Quaker's
n in law, who had attempted to subdue
id ride him. The Quaker's benevolence
mid not endure this ingratitude, and the
rse was sold to Rogers, of the Red Lion
n, at London; A aba having the offer of
maming with the Quaker, or receiving a
m of money. He chose the latter, and
liowed the destinies of the horse and cat.
ogers found Scham utterly mrtactable, and
tributing this to the Moort who occasionly
contrived to visit him in the stable, had
m arrested on a charge of burglary and
>mmiited to Newgate, from whence he was
ily liberated by the efforts and influence
F the Quaker. The story coming to the
irs of Lord Godolphin, he purchased the
>rse of Rogers, and Schamt Agbs, and
e cat, were sent off to Gogmogog Hall,
e seat of Lord Godolphin. Here ho was
sated with about the same indifference and
intempt that had attended him at the pa.
ce of Louis the fifteenth.' The celebrated
>rse Hobgoblin was at ihat time the fav.
ite of Godolphin, and having come in pos.
ssion of Roxana by Flying Childers, he
ittered himself that he should found a $urior
breed from the progeny of these two
?rses? By the. merest accident, the three
irses cametogather; a furious battle ened
between Hobgoblin and Scham, and
e latter, triumphant in love and victory,
as condemned by the vexed Godolphin
be turned out on an almost barren com
mon on the lord's farm, some sixty miles
distant.
The progeny of Scham and Roxanna was
the celebrated Lath, and he early evincing
the greatest powers, and easily beating the
colts of Hobgoblin in the race, the attention
of Godolphin was excited, and Scham, Agba
and the cat, were speedily recalled to Gogmagog
Hall, where the Arabian soon became
lord of the ascendant. In 1738,
three sons of Sch im won the three great
stakes at Newmarket, and the breed, as ra.
cere and fine horses, were found to be uhri.
vailed. Sch&m, after this day, was named
the Godolphin Arabian, and he soon be.
came the mos' celebrated horse in the world.
He died in 1753, aged 29. The slave did'
not long survive his favorite horse, and the
1 cat had paid the debt of nature years before.

From the Geneiee Farmer/ ^
? Har?e DUtcmper, * * '
The horse is one of the most valuable of
the animals that have been subjected to the
dominion of man and he is at the Same time
one of the most liable to injury and most
subject to disease* To some complaints he
is subject at all times ; while there are others
that appear in some unknown manner to be
connected with the season and make their
attacks on animals at certain periods W the
year almost exclusively. Of this kind is the
disease known as the catarrh* catarrhalfe~
vert influenza, but by the farmers generally
as the horse distemper, and which prevails
more at this season of the year ttutft any
other* This disease is sometimes though
not often fatal, unless injudicious measures
are adopted in its treatment, but it isaiways
troublesome, incapacitating a horse for labor
for a long time, and as it is contagious, and
its appearance in the stables, is in mostcases,
u signal that it will extend to all the anima
s exposed, unless the diseased one is re*
moved at once, wo have copied an account
of the disease from the work on the horse
by Mr. Youatt, of the Veterinary College,
London.
M It usually commences like inflantma.

on a livid hue. Fromthecommenoement
of the disease there is some discharge
from dte nose, at first watery, but soon thick,
cr, and containing flukes which adhere at all
times to the nostril. This discharge soon
becomes mattery and offensive. Therfauds

ed ,* the membranes of the nostrils and threat
are inflamed ana tender ; food is neple'?ia?r

these symptoms, and the animal supports

stable* '1 he legs generally swol, andl en.

The pulse rises to sixty or seventy, wbibilL

In cases that are severe or terminate fa.
taliy< ** streaks of red run through the iivkl.
nestf of the nose, the legs become ct> d, the
countenance haggard ; the breath is offensive,
indicating ulceration of the lungs, the
discharge from therose bloody, theevacua.
tions loose and slimy and sometimes bloody,
and the animal is speedily destroyed," At
other times, in a few days, the cough grad.
ually ceases, the swelling in the gtawds of
(be throat swell leas, ine discharge fr&m the
nose assumes a more healthy form, and the
animal is able to eat and drink* with great
case. In such comparatively mild cases,
the horse toon recovers his flesh and
strength, and is able to resume his labors ;
but where the disease iasevere, and inflammation
of the lungs, or suppuration of the
glands of the throat take place, if the animal
is saved, a long time must elapse before he
is fit for labor.
When it is discovered that & hor?t has
the distemper, he should at once be separa.
rtod, if possible, from others, m order to lessen
the chances of a spread of the disease.
If the horse is in the inflammatory stagqr of
the disease, bleeding is indispeitonble, but
pot till faintness is produced. It woujd. be
hgtter to. bleed again if the pulse continues
quick and strong, than to weaken the animal
by a too copious bleeding *t'ohee.
Wuh farmers, however, the disease in its
first stages is rarely noticed, and it is not
until the cough, running at the nose, ond
swelling of the glunds, show the progress
the disease has made, that its presence is
suspected. At this time the horse generally
refuses to eat or drink ; the nose has lost
its inflammatory redness ; and as he is losing
ftoh as well as strength, bleeding- had
better be avoided. Should the horse be
costive care must be tuken that the bowels
ere evacuated by suitable purgatives, and
aloes in doses of two drachms, either in a
ball or solutions, is good for this purpose.
While the fever is high, sweet spirts of nitre
may be given ; the dose will be about 2
drachms. A flannel cloth or wrapper
around the head and throat will be useful,
though air must be freely admitted to the
stable. In severe cases of swelling of the
glands, blistering of these places is some,
times resorted to with success. A discharge
from the nose is a favorable symptom
of the distemper, and it should be promoted
by hot mashes frequently put in the
manger, and some use substances that emit
pungent amoniacal fumes, to promote tbe
discharge from, the nostrils. Continual
care must be taken to support tbo strength
of the animal ; aud many valuable horses
are annually lost from what may be termed I
carelessness in this respect. The horse can- <
not eat dry hay or grain, while his throat is '
so swelled, and hay or grain steamed or boil- <
ed, green grass, carrots cut fine, should be i
provided. In long continued cases, mashes c
made of bran or oatmeal, must be given ;
and if he obstinately refuse to eat, gruel of
proper consistence may be turned down his
throat. If he can be kept up till thesweL 1
ling of the glands subside, or external sup- 1
puratioo takes place, they will generally i
recover, and tho great object in the treatment I
should be to prevent thu entire prostration i
of strength. When the disease terminates I
fatally after the stage of swelling is passed, <
it is by inflammation of the lungs, or putrid i
fever, and when either of these supervene on
the already exhausted animal, there is little <
hope of his again getting up. t
Labor saving Soap.?The following is
a recipe for making the Labor saving Soap,
(so called) which is an excellent article for ,
washing, and a saving of labor. The re- ,
ceipts for making have been sold from 5 to
$10?and the soap 7 cents per pound ; but
cap be manufactured for about two cents.
Take-two pounds of Sal SqjJa?two pounds
yellow bar soap?and ten quarts of water-^
cut the soap in thin slices and boil all together
two hours?then strain it through a
cloth, lot it cool, and i' is fit Tor use. Dir- '
ections for using the soap : put the clothes
in soak the night before you wash, and to
every pail of water in which you bo.l them
add one pound ofsoap. They will need
no rubbing; merely rinse them out, and
they will be perfectly clean and white.
A Mr. Josiah Holbrook il publishing in the
Geneede Farmer, reports on farms which he
visited in some part of Now York, we suppose,
though he does not say so. From the fiist No.
which is on the farm of Gen. Raweon Harmon,
we extract the following sentences.
Planted last year half a bushel of Rohan
potatoes* produced 33 bushels. This year
I nave an acre planted. A single potatoe has
L been known to weigh 13 lbs.
Apples profitablo for Btock, especially hogs,
Last year* kept 13 hogs, of 150 lbs. each, or
more, for two or three months, on one bushel
of apples fed in the morning, the same at
evening, given raw, no other food ; never had
bogs do better. Apples about equal to potatoes,
good feed with bagas, for fatteniog hogs,
both need boiling. Bagas may be fed raw
to cattle, and store hogs.

A gentleman in Virginia (says the Silk Farmer)
who invested $2400 in trees the present
spring, has sold the produce of that sum for
17,000 dollars, after allowing one fourth for
cultivation. Trees three feet high were sold
in New Jersey three weeks ago at 40 cents,
JM|ual to IS lft cents per foot. . At Bwecdrborough
in the same state they have s:nce been
sold at 50 cents, which if the height as is probablc,
does not exceed three feet, is 10 2-3
cents per foot Near Petersburg Va. contracts
have been made, according to the Silk Farmer,
at 1 and 11-2 cents per bud, and some
mailer contracts at 2 cents. The editor of the
same work says that he is authorized to sell
four brick houses in the city of Philadelphia,
in an excellent neighborhood, and paying aix
per cent interest dear of taxes, in exchange
for trees at the market price. So it would
seem moras multicaulis is better property than
real estate in Philadelphia,
ASKING PRICE FOR MULBSRKIES.
J. S. Skinner Esq.?Sir; In a late number
of tbe American Fanner, you mentioned that
both buyers and sellers were making great inquiry
about tbe price of the Moras Multicaulis

sellers would fix upon some price that yon
might be able to give an answer, adding that
jrou would act as agent for either bnyer or sdIhave

sell 5000 at 20 cents (twentrxents) uer foot,
measuring the main stem, the roots and limbs
to be thrown in (they generally abound in the
latter) to be delivered on the farm,) towards
the end of October; or at any other port, at
the expense and risk of the purchaser. I think
by fatt the trees will measure from 5 to 10 fret.
The greater part of them are growing on what
may be called common corn land, and have
not been manured. Some of the trees are
from roots; on these, only one main stem
would be left, with its branches. Or if
preferred, I will take two cents per eye, and
twenty*five cents for each root.

Messrs. EditorsOn looking over your
vety valuable and widely circulated paper,
[ saw in one of the 27th of last June, a notice
of Scarlet Fever, which was said to
have prevailed very generally in some places,
and in many casts proved fatal. And from
this cirrumstanCe the Boston Medical and
Surgical Journal infers that the disease was
not properly treated.
As to its general prevalence and in many
cases its fatality, the inhabitants of this town
and its vicinity can bear amplo testimony.
In sortie ' instances an isolated case
would occur ; in others, two or three in
family ; and in others nearly all in a family
or neighbourhood; assuming quite frequent.
|y a highly mulignant character. The
throat was more or less aff-cted in nearly
all, though tho eruption in many was entirely
wanting.
. In some it provedjatal as soon as the
second or third day from the attack ; and,
?n such cases, delirium supervened in three
ttr four hours after the first warnings of |he
disease. Li chiefly prevailed among children
under 15 years of age. Headache,
chills, soro throat, and vomiting, were hs
first ostensible appearances. Tho fever
would be noticed in four or five hours, and
the eruption in about twenty.four or thirty,
six.

The former of the above paragraphs we copy

The intelligent editors of these respectable peri,
adicals cannot be acquainted with the pathology
of dysentery, or they Would not adrisc their
numerous readers to rely tor its treatment upon
such remedies. The morbid conditions which
chiefly reqniro attention in the treatment ef the
disease are 1 inflammation of the inner coat of

in the functions of the liver; snd 3 deficient

cessfully or safely treated by epecrfic# ; of these
few dysentery is not one. To advise a specific
remedy for it would be not unlike the advioe to a
steamboat captain on tbe Pee Dee to turn his
prow to a given point of the compass and steer
right ahead. Projwrly to prescribe for dysentery
would be to write a treatise on the disease; and
when it was done, a man might almost as ration,
ally expect to make himself a practical cutler
by reading, aa to apply correctly the rules laid
down, without a previous practical acquaintance
with the disease and Its management. Dysentery
is but a modified form of billious fever, produced
by the same general causes, and requiring a
similar treatment, modified by the local symptoms.
An eminent English writer has called it "resais
i.vrsoviasa." fever tarneo inward. It is not to
be trifled with, especially when it prevails as an
epidemic ; or in locations and seasons in which
malarial fever of high grade or malignant character

tery may extend to all the coats of the bowels, in
which case the disease becomes eminently dan"
gerous.
Cases somotimes occur, however, in which a
physician cannot be obtained immediately, and
others are so mild that they hardly render it ueccssary
to consult ono. We shall, therefore, sa
we are on the subject, give Urn outline of a suitable
course of treatment;?premising that a man
who is within reach of a physician (in whom be
can confide) and able to pay for bis advice, ought
never to tamper with himself; or he may do, or
suffer irreparable injury when he leasts suspects
it, as we havo not unfrcqueotly seen happen.
In a very mild,'case of dysentery, at a time
when bilious affections are not prevolant or
severe, the effort* of nature, with rest aud abstemiousness
on the part of the patient, are often sufc
ficient to overcome the dieeaee. In such cases we
would not object to flour pef or corn-meal coffee.
in cases a little mora obstinate, but still mild,
nothing more may be nccessaiy than 20 or 30
grains (equal to a small teaspoonful) of rhubarb,
or a dose of castor oil: ipecacuana will answer
as well as cither, taken in one or two grain doses,
repeated cvory two hours till it operates on the
bowels. It may be made into pill* or mixed with
water.
In severer cases no treatment is to be relied
on in this climate which dies not include the
use of calomel, or mercury in some form. From
10 to 15 grains of calomel may be given every
day, oi every second day, according to the acre*.
