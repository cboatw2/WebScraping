PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Telloie Citizens of the' Semite,
and of the House of Representatives:
In coming together, fellow-citizens, to enter
again npon the discharge of the duties with
which the People have charged up, severally, we
find great ocrasaion to rejoice in the general
prosperity of the country. We are in the en joyment
of all the blessings of civil and religious
liberty, with unexampled means of education,
, knowledge, and improvement. Through the year
?tn r> rinse neic.e has been
WHICH 19 WWW uti." -- ,
in our borders and plenty in our habitations; and
although disease has visited some few portions
of the land with distress and mortality, yet in
general the health of the people has been preserved,
and we are called upon by the nigh
obligations of duty to renew our thanks and
our devotion to our Heavenly Parent, who has
- continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings
which surround us, and who has so sig,
" V; flally crowned the year with his goodness. If
We nnd ourselves increasing, beyond example,
in numbers, in strength, in wealth, in knowledge,
in every thing which promotes human
and social happiness, let us ever remember our
dependence for all these on the protection and
haerciful dispensations of Divine Providence.
Since your last adjournment, Alexander M'Leod,
a British subject, who was indicted for
the murder of an American citizen, and whose
case has been the subject of a correspondence
heretofore communicated to you, has been acquitted
by the verdict of an impartial and intel,-ligent
jury, and has, under the judgement of
the court, been regnlarly discharged.
* , Great Britain having made known to this
, t Government that the expedition which was fitted
from Canada for the destruciton of the steamboat
Caroline, in the winter of 1837, and which
resulted in the destruction of the said boat and
' in the death of an American citizen, was undertaken
by orders emanating from the authorities
of the British Government in Canada, and
* demanding the discharge of M'Leod upon the
ground that, if engaged in that expedition, he
did but' fulfil the orders of his Government,
has thus been answered in the only way in
which she could be answered by a Government,
, the powers of which are distributed among its
several departments by the fundamental law.?
"'Happily for the people of Great Britain, as well 1
as those of the United States, the only mode
f by which an individual arraigned for a criminal
offence before the courts of either can obtain
his discharge, is by the independent action of <
the judiciary, and by proceedings equally fami- 1
SB* . liar to the courts of both countries. 1
If in Great Britain a power exists in the <
Crown to cause to be entered a nolle -prosequi,
.yt which is not the case with the Executive power i
k Si pf the United States upon a prosecution pend- 1
ing in a State court, yet there, no more than here, j
can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner 1
from custody without an order of the proper tri- <
? . .x,.bu'ial drecting'his discharge. '
The precise stage of proceedings at which '
such order may be made is a matter of munici- '
pal regulation exclusively, and not to be com- 1
plained of by any other Government In cases 1
^ . of this kind, a Government becomes politically ]
? ' responsible only when its- tribunals of last re3
' sort are shown to have rendered unjust and in- '<
vjurious. judgments in matters not doubtful. To 1
the establishment and elucidation of this prin- 1
V ciple, no nation has lent its authority more ef-11
ficiently than Great Britain. Alexander M'- J1
Leod having his option either to prosecute a, ]
writ of error from the decision of tne Supreme 1
' Court cf New Xork, which had been rendered
k , upon hiflL application for a discharge, to the Supreme
Court of the United States, or to submit
his case to the decision of a jury, preferred the)
latter, deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining
his liberation: and the result has fully sustained
the wisdom of his choice. The manner 1
in which the issue submitted was tried will satisfy
the English Government that the principles
of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened
decision of an American tribunal. I can f
not fail, however, to suggest to Congress the
propriety, and in some degree the necessity, of
$? making such provisions by law, so far as they '
may constitutionally do so, for the removal at
their commencement, and at the option of the I
party, of all such cases as may hereafter arise, <
and which may involve the faithful observance <
and execution of our international obligations, J
from the State to the Federal Judiciary. This I
Government, by our institutions, is charged '
with the maintenance of peace and the preserva- t
tion of amicable relations with the nations of 1
the earth, and ought to possess, without ques- <
tion, all the reasonable and proper means of 1
maintaining the one and preserving the other.? t
Whilst just confidence is felt in the Judiciary i
' of- the States, yet this Government ought to be <
competent in itself for the fulfilment of the i
high duties which have been devolved upon it, J ]
under me organic iaw, uy uie ?iuvco uiciu- <
selves. I
In the month of September, a party of armed 1
men from Upper Canada invaded the territory of 1
the United States, and forcibly seized upon the '
person of one Grogan, and, under circumstan- 1
ces of great harshness, hurriedly carried him I
beyond the limits of the United States, and de- 1
livered him up to the authorities of Upper [1
Canada. His immediate discharge was ordered j
by the authorities upon the facts of the case be- 1
ing brought to their knowledge?a course of ]
procedure which was to have been expected t
from a nation with whom we are at peace, and 1
which was not more due to the righ s of the ;1
United States than its own regard tor justice.? ]
The correspondence which passed between the, i
Department of State and the British Envoy, 11
Mr. Fox, and with the Governor of Vermont, j I
as soon as the facts had been made known to i
this Department, are herewith communicated. 1
I regret that i'. is not in my power to make ]
known to you ah equally satisfactory conclu- :
sion in thq case of the Caroline 6ieamer, with 1
the circumstance* connected with the destruc- 1
tion of which, in December, 1837, by an i
armed force lit'ed out in theJProvincc of Upper i
Canada, you are already made acquainted.?
No such atonement, as was due lor the public l
wrong done in the United States by tins invasion <
of her territory, or wholly irreconcilable with 1
her rights as an independent Power, has yex
been made, in the view taken by this Govern- i
went, the inquiry whether the vessel was in the
employment of those who prosecuting an unauthorised
war against that Province, or was engaged
hy the owner in the bdailies.-; of transporting
passengers to' and from Navy . Island in
hopes of private gain, which was most probably
c the case, in no degree altera the real question
at issue between the two Governments. This
Governmant cau never concede to any foreign '
Government the ?ower. except in a case of the I
liioet urgent and extreme necessity, of invading
"its territory, either to arrest the persona or destroytihe
property of those who may have violated
tKo municipal laws of such foreign Governmenf,
or have disregarded their obligations ariv
' slug under the law of hfc'.ious. The territory
% "
' * M * . . .
V
Jf
_ ; ?' .
of the United States must be regarded- as
sacredly secure against all such invasions, until
they shall voluntarily acknowledge their ina-!
bility to acquit themselves of their duties.? 1
And, in announcing this sentiment, I do but af- j
firm a principle which no nation on earth would
be more ready to vindicate, at all hazards, than
the people and Government of Great Britain.
If. upon a full investigation of all the facts, it
shall appear that the owner of the Caroline
was governed by a hostile intent, or had made
common cause with those wno were m tne occupancy
of Navy Island, then, so far as he i3
concerned, there can be no claim to indemnity
for the destruction of his boat which this Government
would feel itself bound to prosecute
?since he would have acted not only in derogation
of the rights of Great Britain, but in clear
violation of the laws of the United States; but
that is a question which, however settled, in no
manner involves the high consideration of the
violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction.
To recognise it as an admissible practice
that each Government, in its turn, upon any
sudden and unauthorized outbreak, which, on a
frontier the extent of which renders it impossible
for either to have an efficient force on every
mile of it, and which outbreak, heretofore,
neither may be able to suppress in a day, may
take vengeance into his own hands, and without
even a remonstrance, and in the absence of
any pressing or overruling necessity, may invade
the territory of the other, would inevitably
lead to results equally to be deplored by both.?
When border collisions come to receive the
sanction or to be made on the authority of either
Government, general war must be the inevita
ble remilt While it is the ardent desire of the
United States to cultivate the relations of peace
with all nations, and to fulfil all the duties of
good neighborhood towards' those who possess
territories adjoining their own, that very desire
would lead them to deny the right of any foreign
Power to invade their boundary with an armed
force. The correspondence between the two
Governments on this subject, will, at a future
day of your session, be submitted to your consideration;
and, in the mean time, I cannot but
indulge the hope that the British Government
will see the propriety of renouncing, as a rule
of future action, the precedent whach has been
set in the affair at Schlosser.
I herewith submit the corresqondence which
has recently taken place between the American
Minister at the Court of St. James, Mr. Stevenson,
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that
Government, on the right claimed by that Government
to visit and detain vessels sailing under
the American flag, and engaged in prosecuting
lawful commerce in the African seas. Our commercial
interests in that region have experienced
considerable increase, ana have become an object
of much importance, and it is the duty of this
Government to protect them against all improper
ind vexatious interruption. However, desirous
the United States may be for the suppression of
:he slave trade, they cannot consent to interpolations
into the maritime code at the mere will and
pleasure of other Governments. We deny the
right of any such interpolation to any one, or all
rhe nations of the earth, without our consent.?
Wo claim to have a voice in all amendments or
iterations of that code; and when we are given
to understand, as in this instance, by "a foreign
Government, that its treaties with other nations
cannot be executed without the establishment
and enforcement of new principles of maritime
police to be applied without, our consent, we
must employ a language neither of equivocal
import nor BUscfptible of misconstruction.?
American citizens prosecuting a lawful commerce
in the African seas, under the flag of their
country, are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful
use of that flag by otherp, nor can they
rightfully, on account of any such alleged abuses,
be interrupted, molested or detained while
on the ocean; and if thus molested and detained
while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way
and violating no law themselves, they are unquestionably
entitled indemnity. This Government
has manifested its repugnance to the slave
trade in a manner which cannot be misunderstood.
By its fundamental law it prescribed limits in
point of time to its continuance; and against its
jwn citizens who might so far forget the rights
)f humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it
has long since by its municipal laws, denounced i
die most condign punishment. Many of the
States composing this Union had made appeals
:o the civilized world for its soppression long 1
jefore the moral sense of other nations had be:ome
shocked by the iniquities of the traffic.
Whether this Government should now enter into :
xeaties containing mutual stipulations upon this 1
subject, is a question for its mature deliberation.
Certain it is, that if the right to detain American
ships on the high seas can be justified on the
plea of a necessity for such detention, arising
3ut of the existence of treaties between other
aations, the same plea may be extcnted and enlarged
by the new stipulations of new treaties, to
ivhich the United States may not be a party.?
This Government will not cease to urge upon'
;hat of Great Britain full and ample enumeration
for all losses, whether arising from deten:ion
or otherwise, to which American citizens
liave heretofore been or may hereafter be sublected,
by the exercise of rights which the Government
cannot recognise as legitimate and
sroper. Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the
sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain.
Iter to make retribution for any wrong or loss
which any American citizen engaged in the i
prosecution of lawful commerce inay have experienced
at the hand of her cruisers or other public
authorities. This Government, at the same
:ime, will relax no effort to prevent its citizens,
f there be any so disposed, from prosecuting a
:raffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity,
it seeks to do no more than to protect the fair
ind honest trader from molestation and injury;
aut while the enterprising mariner engaged in
:he pursuit of an honorable trade, is entitled to
its protection, it will visit with condign punishment
others of an opposite character.
I invite your attention to existing laws for the J i
suppression of the African slave trade, and re- <
commend all such alterations as may give to'
them greater force and efficacy. That the Ame-!
rican flag is grossly abused by the abandoned
and profligate of other nations is but too probable.-'3
Congress has, not long since, had this subject
under its consideration, and its importance well
justifies renewed and anxious attention.
I also communicate, herewith, the copy of a
correspondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord
PalmerstOD, upon the subject, so interesting to
several of the Southern States, of the rice duties
which resulted honorably to the justice of Great
Britain and advantageously to the United States.
At the opening of the last annual session, the
President informed Congress of the progress

say that little further advancement of the object
has beeii accomplished since last year; but this
is owing to circumstances no way indicative ol
any abatement of the desire of both parties to
hasten the negotiation to its conclusion, and to
settle the question in dispute as early as possiKin
Tn tho miirco nf flif> session. it is my hope
*14 yuv vwu.uv Vl
to be able to announce some further degree oi
progress towards the accomplishment of this
highly desirable end.
The commission appointed by this Government
for the exploration and survey of the line o:
boundary separating the States of Maine anc
New Hampshire from the counterininous Britisl
provinces is, it is believed, about to close its fielc
labors, and is expected soon to report the results
of its examination to the Department of State.?
The report when received; will be laid before
Congress. * * * * : '
The joint-commission under the Conventior
with Texas, to ascertain the true boundary be
tween the two countries, has concluded it3 la
bore; but the final report of the commissionon
on the part of the United States has not been re
ceived. It is understood, however, that the me
redian line, as traced by the commission, lie;
somewhat further east than the position hithert<
generally assigned to it, and, consequently, in'
eludes in Texas some part of the territory whicl
had hitherto been considered as belonging to the
States of Louisiana and Arkansas.
The United States cannot but take a deep interest
in whatever relates to this young, but
growing Republic. Set'led principally by emigrants
from the United States, we have the hap.
piness to know, that the great principles of civil
liberty are there destined to flourish, under wise
institutions and wholesome laws; and that, thro'
its example, another evidence is to be afforded ol
'
the capacity of popular institutions to advance uic
prosperity, happiness and glory of the human
race. The great truth that govennent was made
for the people, and not the people for governmenf,
has already been established in the practice
and by the example of these United States;
and we can do no other than contemplate it3 further
exemplification by a sister Republic, with
the deepest interest * >35? * *
The war with the Indian tribes of the peninsula
of Florida has, during the last summer and
fall, been prosecuted with rm untiring activity
and zeal. A summer campaign was resolved
upon as the best mode of bringing it to a close.
Our brave officers and men who have been engaged
in that service, have suffered toils and privations
and exhibited an energy, which, in any
other war would have earned for them unlading
laurels. In despite of the sickness incident to
the climate, they have penetrated the fastnesses
of the indians, broken up their encampments and
harrassed them unceasingly. Numbers have
been captured, and still greater numbers have
surrendered, and have been transported to join
their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to
them by the government; and a strong hope is
entertained that, under the conduct of the gallant
officer at the head of the troops in Florida, that
troublesome and expensive war is destined to a
speedy termination. * * *
Should it be necessary, in any view that Congress
may take of the subject, to revise the existing
tariff duties, I beg leave to say, that in the
performance of that most delicate operation, moderate
counsels would sccirt to be the wisest.?
The Government under which it is our happiness
to live, owes its existence to the spirit of compromise
which prevailed among its framers?
jarring and discordant opinions could only have
been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism
which prompted conciliation,' and resulted in
harmony. In the same spirit, me compromise
bill, as it is called, was adopted at the session of
1833. While the people of no portion of
the Union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary
taxes for the support of the government,
yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition
of burthens not really necessary for that object.
In imposing duties, however, for the purposes
of revenue, a right to discriminate as to the
articles oil which the duties shall be laid, as well
as the amount, necessarily and most propferly exists.
Otherwise, the Government would be placed
in the condition of having to levy the same
duties upon all articles, the productive as well as
the unproductive. The slightest duty upon some,
might have the efTect of causing their importation
to cease; whereas, others, entering extensively
into the consumption of the country, might
bear the heaviest, without any sensible diminution
in the amount imported. So also the Government
may be justified in so discriminating, by
reference to otber considerations of domestic policy,
connected with our manufactures. So long
aa the duties shall be laid with distinct reference
to the wants of the treasury, no well founded
abjection can exist against them. It might be
esteemed desirable that no such augmentation
of the taxes should take place as would have
the effect of annuling the land proceeds distribution
act of the last session, which act is declared
to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased
to 20 per cent the maximum rates cs*
Sfc
tablished by the compromise act.
At your late session, I invited your attention
to the condition of the currency and exchanges,
and urged the necessity of adopting such measures
as were consistent with the constitutional
competency of the Government, in order to correct
the unsoundness of the one, and as far as
practicable, the inequality of the other. No
country can be in the enjoyment of the full measure
of its prosperity, without the presence of a
medium of exchange, approximating to uniformity
of value. What is necessary as between the
lifferent nations of the earth, is also important as
between the inhabitants of different parts of the
?ame country; with the first the precious metals
constitute the chief medium of circulation, and
5Uch$l60 would be the case as to the last, but for
inventions comparatively modern, which have
furnished, in placo of gold and silver, a paper
circulation. I do not propose to enter into a
comparative analysis of the merits of the two
systems. Such belonged more properly to the
period of the introduction of the paper system.
The speculative philosopher might find inducements
to prosecute the inquiry, but his researches
could only lead him to conclude, that the paper
system had probably better never have been
introduced, and that society would have been
much happier without it. The practical^ statcsi?koc

has to look at things as they are; to take them as
he finds them?to supply deficiencies, and to
prune excesses as far as in him lies. The task o 1
furnishing a corrective for derangementa of the
paper medium with us, is almost inexpressibly
great The power exerted by the States to charter
banking corporations, and which have been
carried to great excess, has filled the country
with, in most oMhe Statesman irredeemable paper
medium, is an evil which, in some way oj
other, requires a corrective. The rates at which
bills of exchange are negociated between differ
eni parts ofthe country, furnish an index of the
value of the local substitute for gold and silver
which is, in many .parts, so far depreciated, at
not to be received except at large discount, ir

It could earnestly be desired that every bank, tl
: not possessing the means of resumption, should a
> follow the example of the late-U. States Bank of b
i; Pennsylvania, and go into liquidation, rather than p
j by refusing to do so to continue embarrassments d
s j in the way of solvent institutions, " thereby aug- ii
r!mentingthe difficulties incident to the .present I
! i cQndition of things. Whether this Government I
with due regard to the rights of the States, has e
- J any power to constrain the banks, either to re- p
f | hume specie payments or to force them into 0
i liquidation, is an enquiry wmcn win not iau to r
i claim your consideration. In view of the great a
1 advantages which are allowed the corporators, c
? not among the least of which is the authority c
- contaiflod in most of their charters, to make n
h loans to three times the amount of their capjtal, n
thereby often deriving three times as much in- d
1 terest on the same amount of money, as any in- s
dividual is permitted by law to receive, no sufii- f
" cienVipology can be urged for a long continued d
' suspension of specie payments. Such suspen- i;
sion is" productive of tile greatest detriment to Ii
- the public, by expelling from circulation the pre- s
? cious metals, and seriously hazarding the sue- \
i cess of any effort that this government can make ?
" to increase commercial facilities, and to advance
i the public interests. * * * * t
' In the absence of sny controlling power over i:
this subject, which by forcing a general rcsump- c
tionof specie payments wotlld at once have the r
t effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange, s
' and would leave the country but little to desire, \
what measure of relief, falling within the limits a
I of our constitutional competency, does it become t
! this country to adopt? It was my painful duty j 1
at your last session, under the weight of most a
f solemn obligations, to differ with Congreb3 on d
! the measures which it proposed for my approval, c
1 and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of I
! existing evils. Subsequent rcflection^arid events 13
since occurring, have only served to confirm me a
in the opinions I then entertained and frankly ex- li
pressed. * * V * . * I
In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my v
1' last message to Congress, (which pie Jge 1 urge ti
as an apology for adventuring to present you the t<
details of any plan) the Secretary of the Treasu- ii
ry will be ready to submit, should you require it, n
a plan of finance, which, while it throws around fi
the public treasure reasonable guards for its pro- g
tcction, and rests on powers acknowledged in C
nractice to exist from the origin of the govern- o
incnt, will, at the same time, furnish to the n
country, a sound paper medium and afford all ti
reasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges. n
When submitted, you will perceive in it a plan b
amendatory of the existing laws in relation to t:
the Treasury department?subordinate in all re- ti
spects to the will of Congress directly, and to the y
will of the people indirectly?self-sustaining, p
should it bd; found in practice to realize its pro-, a
1 miees in theory, and repealable at the pleasure! c
Tof Congress. It proposes by effectual restraints!? :'p
and by involving tlie true spirit of oiir Intitutions, ,]
to separate the purse from the sword; or, more p
properly to-speak, denies any other control to j
the President over the agenta who may be in- tl
d is pens ably necessary to secure the fidelity of h
such agents; and by wise regulations, keeps &
plainly apart from each other private and public t'
funds. If contemplates the establishment of a k
Guard of Control at the seat of Government, ?
with agencies at prominent commercial points,; ei
or wherever else Congress shall direct; for the j
safekeeping and disbursement of the public.
moneys, and a substitution at the option of the j p,
public creditor, of Treasury notes in lieu of bi
gold and silver. It proposes to limit the issues j 0<
to an amount not exceeding $15,000,090, with- : e:
| out the express sanction of the legislative pow- j 1
er. It also authorizes the receipt of individual s;
depositcs of gold and silver to a limited amount, a:
and the granting certificates of depesitos, divid- tc
ed into such sums as may be called for by de- b.
positors. It proceeds a stop further, and au-1 <r
thorizes the purchase and sale of domestic bills ' ri
and drafts, resting on a real and substantial ba- S
sis, pnyable at sight, or having but a short time tv
toiun, and drawn on places not less than one ir
hundred miles apart; which authority, except al
in so far as may be necessary -for Government ti
purposes exclusively, is only to be exerted upon tl
the express condition that its exercise shall not e
j !;e prohibited by the State in which the agency tl
j is situated. ^ Z ](
In order to cover tne expenses i ciuem 10
the plan, it will be authorized, to receive moderate
premiums for certificates issued on depositee,
and on bills bought and sold; thus, as far
as its dealings extend, to furnish facilities to ll
commercial intercourse at the lowest possible n
rates, and to subduct from the earnings of in- ^
dustry the least possible sum. It uses the State t(
banks at a distance from the agencies, as aux- n
iliariee, without imparling any power to trade 01
in its name. It is.subject to such guards and
rcstariuts as have appeared to be necessary. It "
is the creature of law, and exist only at the "
pleasure of the legislature. It is made to rest e
on an actual specie basis, in order to redeem H
the notes at the places of issue; produces no I:t
dangerous redundancy of circulation, affords Cl
no temptation to speculation; is attended by no P:
?ria <,nnnhlr> in its oneration: w
| ilJiirtllUll \ji jniuwc, ... _r y i
makes the Treasury notes which it may use along j a
with the certificates of deposite, and the notes of ^
specie-paying banks, convertible at the place e
i where collected, receivable in payment of Go- ?
vernment dues,* and, without violating any prin- *
ciple of the Constitution, affords the Government u
and the people such facilities as are called for by P;
the wants of both. Such, it has appeared to me,
are its reccoinincndations; and in view of them ir
it will be submitted, whenever you require it, to I3
your consideration. ta
I ain not able to perceive that any fair and pi
candid objection can be urged against the plan, ei
the principal outlines of which I have thus pre- pi
sented. I cannot doubt but that the notes which tl
it proposes to furnish, at the voluntary option b;
| of the public creditor, issued in lieu of the revc- di
1 nuc and its certificates of deposite, will be main- ir
tained at an equality with gold and silver ever}-- b
where. They are redeemed in gold aud si'ver, tl
on demand, at the places of issue; they are re- c<
ceivable everywhere in payment of Government r<
I dues. The Treasury notes are limited to an ]
j amount of one-fourth less than the estimated afl- no
| nual receipts of ihe Treasury; ana, in aumuon, pj
'they rest upon the faith of Government for their A!
.'redemption. If all these assurances are not k;
, sufficient to make them available, then the idea^ e<
; as it seems to me of furnishing a sound paper si
: medium of exchanges, may be entirely" abandon- ti
1 ed. aJ
I If a fear be indulged that the Government may 111
11 be tempted to run into excess in its issues at any ^
. future day, it seems to me that no such appre- a
^ hensioncan reasonably be entertained until all
confidence in the representatives of the States t
t and of the people, as well as in the people them- cl
1 selves, shall be lost. The weightiest considera-j is
!; tions of .policy require that the straints now pro- la
,' posed to be thrown around the measure should ci
! not, for light causes, be removed. To argue ai
i against any proposed'plan its liability to possible ' c;

bnse, is ,to reject-every .esjpedient, since everyriing
depended on human action is liable to
bnee. - Fifteeitf-millions of Treasury notes may
e issued as the maximum; but a' discretionary
ower is to be given to the Beard of Control uner

lank of the United States, its circulation barely*

eceive private depositee to a limited, amount,
rid to issue certificates in such suras as may bet
ailed for by the depositors, may $o far-fill up the
hannels of circulation as greatly to diminish the .

I feel it mv dutvto brins under vour'comidera- :
on a practice which has grown up in the adlinistration
of.tbe Government, and which, lam
ccply convinced, ought -to be corrected. I aHude

ithcr than reason, has vested in the Presidents, .
F removing incumbents from office, in in forder *

ant party. My own conduct, in this respect,. v
as been governed by a conscientious purpose to
xercise the removing'power, only in case of
nfaithlulncss or inability, or in those in which
s exercise appeared necessary; in order to disauntenance
and suppress that spirit .of active
artisanship on the part of holders of office,
rhich riot only'withdorws them from the steadynd
impartial discharge of- their official' duties,
ut exerts an undue and injurious influence over
lections, and degrades the character of the Govrnment
itself, inasmuch as it exhibits the Chief .
fagistrate, as being a party, tiirougii ms agents,

arties. ."jr. * "
In respect to the exercise of this power nothlgsh'ould
be left to discretion, which may safer
be regulated by lawr and it is of high impormce
to restrain, as far as possible the stimulusof
jrsonal interests in public elections. Considring
the great increase which has been made in
ublic offices in the last quarter of a country, and '
le probability of fart her.increase," we incur the
azard of witnessing violent political contests,
rcctcd too often to thc'single object of retainig
office, by those who are in, or obtaining it,
y those who are out, : Under the influence fof
lese convictions, I shall cordially concur inany
mstitntional measures for regulating; and by
jgulating, restraining,.the power of removal.
1 suggost for you consideration, the propriety of
iaking, without further delay, some specific aplication
of the funds derived under the will of
lr. Smithson/of England, for the diffusion of
uowledge; and which have heretofor, been vest1
in public stock, until such time as Congress
lould think proper to give them a specific airecon.
Nor will you, I feel confident, permit any
jatement of the principal of the legacy to be
lade should it turn out that the stocks, in which
>? imfMtmonts have been made, have undergone
depreciation.:s v
In conclusion, I commend to your care the invests
of this DistrSi, for which you are the exusivc
legislators. Considering" tliat this city

also, the great cost of the Public Buildings,
