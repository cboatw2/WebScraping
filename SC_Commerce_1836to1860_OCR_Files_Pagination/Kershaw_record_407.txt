6 SATURDAY MORNING, JUDY 2J, 1840. .
THE SUB-TREASURY ACT.
Thcro are few of our readers, we immaginc, who '
peruse the laws of tho United States, as they ap.'
pear in the newspapers, in which they are published j
?n~ ? Bolicvinir this to be the ease, and!
uy uuu.v.-.j- ?
believing too, that there arc many of them who are >
anxious to see the provisions of the Sub-Treasury !
Act, wo take occasion to call their special' attcn-'
tion to it. It tvill be found in our columns to-day,
and we hope it will receive an attentive perusal. If
all, or any, of the mischief which has been pre-j
, dieted from its passage, can grow out of it, we j
confess oarseh'09 at a loss to perceive in what man-1
. ncr. The 19th section of the act, which contains
I the specie clause, and about winch such a hue and
I cry has been raised from one end of /he country to !
the other, seems to us quite powerless in the way ,
rf mischief, and if any reason is tc be found for ,
?mplaint, it should bo because it does not bring uR
the legal currency at an earlier period. From ,
K.;<? cnxtinn i? iv'tt hf neronived that now. one fourth,
specie, and from and after the 30th day of June'
next, 0110 half will be required; on the 30lh June |
1812 three fourths,; and on the 30;h June 1813, the i
whole amount will have to be paid in gold and silver
only. j
No one ca i have witnessed, the embarrassments,
the difficulties, and expense which has attended the
transfer and disbursement of the public funds, under
the system of making Banks the financial agents
of tho Government, without being convinced that
some clunige was necessary?that there was something
radically imperfect in its organization, which .
prevented its Accomplishing the end contemplated.?
The plan adopted by this Act is perfectly simple and
will no doubt effectually banish the difficulties of;
transferring and disbursmg, besides "being of 110 j'
doubtful constitutionality, and this last feature particularly
should be an especial recommendation to
every democratic republican. It willl have the cf
* feet too, of preventing tho violation of one portion
of tho Constitution, which under the o'd system,'
was frequently set at naught. The Constitution
says " all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform
throughout the United States." So long as '
Bank notes wore receivable this article was palpably j
violated. To make the duties equal at every point,
.?i? ??. i._ ??;,i ?/ nvnn- nnint 111 a currency of i
mtzy luuot wo |^w?v? u? v.w.j r-? ? _
equal value " throughout the United States," when j
it is known to every one conversant with commercial <
affairs, that no article of commerce lias been more _
fluctuating in its value, for the last four years than
Bank notes. What is the slate of things now in the '
South Western Sates? Bank notes are worth in Mis-!
sissippi, the best of them, from 10 to 50 cents in ;
the dollar; in Alabama from 60 to 83 and in Georgia
from 73 to 00 cents; and we might go on to enu.
merate a number of other States, in which the currency
is equally as unsettled, showing the utter
impossibility, unless with provisions something like
this Act, of making the "duties, imposts, and ex-1
cises uniform throughout the United Slates." But
we need not dwell on the subject; the Act will ex-,
plain itself, and its best recommendation, wo doubt
not, will bo found, in the stability and uniformity of
the currency, which it will give to the country, of- '
ter it has gone fully into operation.
. j
Specie Payments.?Ali the Banks in the'City of
Charleston which had suspended specie payments,
resumed on Saturday last. This was a sudden, and ,
. rather unexpected move, but none the less desirable !
*' or acceptable, on that account. We arc not awaro
of the circumstances which influenced them, apparently
without reflection and without concort, to >
adopt this course, but we imagine that some powerful
and convincing argument, must have been pre- J
sontod, which proved, conclusively, that suspension
was not so profitable, or so popular a business as J
had been anticipated.
[
(C The publication of the article from our cor-'
respondent " Lycurgus," is rendered unnecessary,
and would be inappropriate, sinco the resumption of
^>pccic payments by the suspended Banks of this '
State. This circumstance will account for its non
appearance.
ITT We have heard it remarked that tlio resumption
of specie payments will have one beneficial t f.
feet, whi~h strikes us as exceedingly .humane, if
not important. It will relieve the painful anxiety of
many in the up-country, who have been seriously
alarmed, lest same of the dealers in the precious [
metals in the city should take the country fever, from I
tlioir frequent and imprudent visits to the interior |
Banks during the warm season, and thus deprive the ;
State of some of her most enterprising citizens. j
Tiie Ladies' Companion.?The July number comes:
to us filled with oxccllenl original contributions, and j
an addition of eight extra pages. It is embellished
with a beautiful steel engraving, ,4 view of Boston
from Chelseaand two pages ol" Music.
ARRIVAL Or T11E BRITISH QUEEN.
The Steam ship British Queen, arrived at New
^ York from London, on the iHth instant, having left
tho latter city on the 'Jd July. The news by tins
arrival is not of a very important character.
An attempt was made on the 10th June, by a
young man named Oxford, 6aid to be insane, to
assassinate tho Queen and Prince Albert. lie deliberately
discharged two pistols, one at the Prince,
and one at tiie Queon, as their carriage passed 011
its way to Ilyde Park, Neither of the shots did any
damage. He was immediately arrested, and was to
have had his trial on the 9th pf July.
The valet of Lord William Russel, Courvoisier,
has been convicted for the murder of his Lordship,
and subsequently made a full confession of the fact,
Tho King of Prussia died on tho 7th June.
The French troops in Africa, under the command
of Marshall Vallee, have been defeated with great
loss, by the Arabs, under Abd-cl-Kadcr.

million sterling for the Republic of Texas.
Gen. J. H. Eaton, minister to Spain came home
in the British Queen.
The Cotton markot was without any matorinl
. - change during the whole month of June. Prices
were fully eust^ue&'throofrijoiU the
there is a great depression in trades' and much cuibarrassnicnt
in the inaiiulacturiug districts, it is
suggested that a decline in the Cotton market was
only prevented by the news, which had reached
England, of the immense freshets which overflowed
the South and South West during the month of May.
It was supposed in London, that the growing crop
in Georgia and South Carolina would he diminished
500,000 bales. This is about the whole crop of the
two Slates.
*Xf.w Cotton.?A bale of new Cotton reached
New Orleans 011 1 Ith instant, and was immediately
shipped for Liverpool.
The C'nors.?We have enquired of many persons
from the country, within the last week, and as far
as we can learn, the corn crops uarticularly in the
uplands, promise an abundant hat vest. The crop
planted in the river swamp sinco the freshet, is, wo
undeix and, doing well.

Gentlemen: I have received yours of the
11ih iust. reouc.stinsr a copy of my Oration
for the press. I feel grateful for the flattering
estimate you have put upon an effort,
which, whatever may have been its
merit, I do not conceive deserved the high
encomium which the partiality of friendship
has passed upon it. As it was almost
wholly unpremeditated, and the exercise
of writing has become extremely laborious
to me, and believing too, that a newspaper
could be filled with matter of greater
contemporary interest, I would respectfully
decline its proposed publication.

PATENT INVENTION.
A connection of the plough by aid of
a levlp., to act in a frame upon four
wheels.?This, after various trials, promises
to perform its task.
There is at present an objection to it which
seems impossible to remedy, in turning
round; to obviate which, it will have to
move in a circle. A set of ploughs or
harrows can be attached to the same frame.
The utility of which can best be judged
by the frame.
reasons in support of the principle.
A wagon is computed to weigh 1.000
lbs. The draft for four horses is 3,000
lbs. making 4,000 lbs. Now, if 3 feet of
solid earth 12 inches in width, draw 1,300

to those whom it may interest, or
to the Committee on Agriculture. 1 have
ploughed several rounds on an imperfect

From'the Charleston Courier.
Messrs. Editors.?An article appeared
! in your paper on Monday, 13th entitled
! "Political Capita] Lost," and signed An
Observer, which, if it means any thing,
attempts to assert that the Chronicle, recently
established as the Harrison papei
in Columbia, is opposed to Co). Hammond.
- Now
we say that the farce will not an
[swer.
The Chronicle, with all its Harrison
clique, is beyond question for Hammond,
and opposed to Richardson ahd all
his supporters, and they must not be oli
lowed to forage on the democratic party
for " political capital," which I will not
say they have Xost, f?r they have not got
it \ et. The Chronicle may seek to give a
delusive coloring to its editorials if it
pleases, for party purposes?but the very
editorial which " An Observer" so unscrupulously
garbles as opposed to Hamj
mond, attacks Col. Richardsou unfairly
! and bitterly.
j To set lie this question at once, we will
[ ofi'er 11 few queries, to which we beg ex'
plicit answers.
1. lias not a meeting been held by the
; Ilarrisonites near Columbia, in the fork,
| and have they not determined to vote for
no man to the Legislaturewhovotes against
| Hammond.!
2. Arc not all the gentlemen who arc :
understood as being concerned in csta- <
I blishing the 44 Chronicle," understood to'i
j be-the_g.tanrich friends of ("Jen. Harrison, i
j and also of Col. IhiKmond? ;
j 3. Is not every Harrison candidate in
ivre!iland Distnci. rffr~TTie Le^rsmrtrrc, p
known to be a Hammond man? j i
We have more .queries in store if requisite,
but until these arc answered, we J j
will reserve them. If these things are! i
true, thev demonstrate the utter absurdity 11
of charging on Richardson as a fact, that j
he derives support or even good wish from ; (
his political enemies, the Harrison Whigs.,
ANOTHER OBSERVER. |j
(
Aaron Burp..?In the course of Mr. ,
Leigh's argument yesterday, he adverted
to Aaron Burr's case. He said that what
was Burr's intention he never knew, and (
he did not suppose it ever would be known.!
Pending his trial in the court in this city, j
he, (Mr. L.) then a young man, paid the i,
most incessant and studious attention to '
the evidence and every thing connected
with it; but he could not find out what
j Burr had designed. Years afterwards he
! made the inquiry of the late Mr. Wickham,|
who was one of Burr's counsel, if he knew
1 what were Burr's intentions. He replied
: that he knew nothing more than any one
else might have known who paid the same
attention to the case that he was compel-,
i led to pay to it. Mr. Wickham gave as ;
| his opinion, however, that Burr's design:
was to get up an expedition against me :
then Spanish province of Texas, with a j
view to establish an empire there for him-!
self; and that he intended to borrow the,
money to defray the expenses of the ex-'
; pediiion from the United States Bank at;
New Orleans.
If this were the case, it displayed the
j tact and clear sightedncss of Burr, as time
: has proved; for he lived to see, first Mexi!
co freed from Spanish donjinion, and then
j Texas sever herself fiom the Mexican
i Republic and become an independent
. Slate. lie was arrested in 1807?three j
j years afterwards an insurrection "broke j
out in Mexico against the government of
' the Viceroy, and in three years more,
i after several hard-fought battles,?the independence
of Mexico was declared by the
'Mexican Congress. lie only commenced)
preparations a little too soon, if his object)
was such as Mr. Wickham supposed.?
