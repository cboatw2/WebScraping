About nine years ago, Mr Nivn began i<>
pay attention to lite rul ure of asparagus,
from being situated in a place wlxio, pre.
viouuly 10 his management, the cr< p ha <
nlwuvs faile i. H 'adopted us a principle I uenriching
of the surface soil n;;d theencorag-.
nient ol 'he surface feeding roots, in opposition
to the usnal prac'ice of deep trenching
and deep manuring. Wec<>n easily conceive
that the result of this would^b" earlier and h i
ter fl ivored heads; nut Mr. Niven also found
that the produce of cultivation on the ?:nrfare.feeding
principle was even more bu-ky
than that r tilery or deep preperatiou ol
feeding. Mi. Niv?'ii planted in rows.?
The surface of ihe sod to he planted '*idi
asparagus is enriched with hulfroenj
loaves and rotten botjbed dung. to the depth
of 3 in. fo which is ad I. d, where i: rail <?b- I
tuiued, a s t Hum of seaweed. Before plan- J T*
ting, the grond is laid up in ridges 4 ft- rt
apart and the roots of the plains are Vl
down on the htie ridge or saddle prep -red ?i|
for them, as a man sts upon horseback;*' a n
nrrson following with a harrow full of sund,
which, with the spade, he "lays over the p
roo's and crowns, a'?out an inch thick, ob- il
serving to tread successively both sides ol si
earh hne as he proceeds, vvitn oil? foot, to t<
firm t'?e sand to the plants, so to secure t!
them from ho action of the air, until the m
proc-ss of planting is concluded, when a <'
Bfcr,ni{ mid fniiil converiiu? ol nhout 4 in.-? \ a
of rich compost of dung and rotten leaves
is to be pui over the tidies or lines, which a
is to be firmly trodden to the line of plants ?
ns before. A small portion of original stir- I1
face between the rows may then he thrown ''
up with the spad'*, right and left, dressing u
neatly between every two lines as yon pio 1
ceed, and the process of planting, which is t
exceedingly simple, is finished." (p. 22.)? 1
Tim produce of two rows, trea e?.| in this i
inann'-r, Mr. N ven has found 4,fully equaljii. '
quantity to any one bed with three rows on t
it, besides being much superior in quahty."
<
The plants appear growing out of eleva *
fed ridges; nnd in May, when the shot grass <
mowing begins, n portion of grass is shaken 1
in between the rows so as 'O fi 1 tho hollow
space quite to the n*'cks of the plan's.?
This supplies nourishment and retains mois- *
tnre while the slight degree of fermentation .
which takes place, heats the soil ar.d s'iriiu- '

and afterwards nl>o in cut mg lor use, is of

I fare of the plan." Mi* Niven's ohjrtis I

'a* the base of those shoo s may be s rung and t
fit to tnrow oji vigorous heads next year.

vat-* g'-ntleuiiiii's gardener can 8' nd no '

But lo return to Mr. Niven's practice.? <
In Novetnb* r, wiienthe tops l aving become 1
yellow are cut over, ih" crown of the ridg?- 1
is reduced a hole with ilv hand, and about 4 1
in. of sea or rabbit sand is laid over
tue line of plants, while ro Ml dung. 1
l< av?*s, and sea sand are sl.-ghSy stirred '

J needless to go farther in o rout ne culture.? '
Suffice it to say, that Mr. Niven has fully] I

duly re/hced on, might have been foreseen. i
Tne some principle is now being very gen. '

scnplion of useful plan', and more especially '
to tiie cul ure of huit tress. In short, the {
subsoil is begining to be considered as 1
chi? fly useful as a reservoir of w?yr, an I '
the surface soil as a store-house of food. I
We ore glad to find Mr. Nven disap J
proving of cutting the heads of asparagus 1
a lt-w inches below the surface; "for wha1 *
uselul purpose this is done," he says, "we 4
arc at u loss to conce ive, inasmuch as the f
! wli te or blanched part of the grass is so f
usually hard und stingy as to be scarcely 1
