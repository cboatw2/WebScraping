A Xew World Discovtred.-The Un
known Nation of Central America, which
Mr. Stephens received some intimations
during his first visit to tihe celebrated ruins
of our Continent. is also spoken of by the a
French traveller Waldeck. Mr. Norman n
thus sp'ekks of the reports concerning it in f
his recent work on Yucatan and the an- P
cient ruins:
"There i4 a dis:rict of:-nuntry situated 1
between Gnatamala, Yucatan. and Chia- p
pas, that has uever yet been subdued. r
This section is surrounded by mountuins, d
and is said to be inaccessible except by
one way, and that not generally knowu.
No one yet. who has the boldness to fil
low the inhabitants to their wild rctreat,
has ever returned to render an account of
his journey. The inhabitants are repre- t
sented as speaking the Maya and Tehole I
languagesand many of them asconversiog
well in Spanish. I ron the laiter c::um
tanco, they are enabled to visit the near
est cities and sell their tobacco, the princi
pal aiticle.they cultivate, and afterwards c
return to their retreats.-Theiy are consti

tie bas not mentioned.. The rame notion
is spoken of by Mr. Stepheu'. Their
numit'r is estimated at thirty thuan~ad ;
their secluded mode of life makes it almst
aimpossible to arrive at ay thing like cor
r-ect impressions respect ing thetn. The
Indians of Yucatan uad the neighboring~
province have been seen in coaversation
with persons fronm this district; they, how
ever, appear as others. Could a friendly
intercourso, by any possibility, be orab
lishied wiish tis surprising country, the.re
is scarcely a doubt that a complete know-I
edge of the former inhabitants of the im- a
mecuse ruins scattered tharouaghout the pao
vinces wvould be revealedl. That their ionm
pIes and ree-ordls remain in safety, and are
capable of speakini to posterity, there can
scarcely be a que..it i.
"I doubt if the above be a true estimate
of their.. numbers, since they. have been
enabled to sustain thiemselves for ages (no
one knows hew lengg) against enetmies and
-intestine wars andI dissoluion. It would
be more reasonalie to suppose that they
are the outcast of Pelasgi of somne invad
ing nation, nead the remnants of a powera
that once defended those wasted towns
that now Jiea lange. mass of scattered ru
ias. The gabhered fragments of Pales.
qup, apid other conqnered places of equal
importance, may hiave eneentrated their
breken strength within thme houndaries, of
these halls, and, under the strog impulse
of desperatiotn,. they raay have preserved
their tratiotality lin defiance of alf th'e force
that surrounded thean. It may well ex
cite universal anioni'shment, when the fact
becomes known.'thatiliere actually ex

miles, a distinct pecople, that have govern

tinue to do so wiihout assistance or pin-i
tection. It would be a lesses to mankitd
to asenrain how they have managed thfeIr
self-governing principles, arid bow they
have preserved their national individnahi- .
y. Three centuries have transpired since
the conquest ; atnd, if neither- Yankee nor
Irishniant have found his way among the
Lacadronos before ihis, it deserves the
careful consIderation both of the psychal- I
oglec and the statesman."

Tls afa r Dr S.
highly elebraed 'Iiiu4alI Miy, inl
Rockbritge county VA., called the Alum
Springs. These waters. in their-eiects
upon the system ajir tonic, increitg tbc
appetite, and promotingdigestion, tbey arm
alternative, exciting the secreticas of the
glandular system generallysnd particular
of the liver and kidneys;, they are cathartic,
produciu' copious, dark, billious evacoa
tions; and they also effect a dctermination
to the surface, increasing the perspsRtion,
From tho combination of all these efects
upon the system, they are a great puriSer
bf the blood, and equalizer of the cireula
tion. The efect of the Pills, made tena
these waters, arc in -all respects, similar to
the water itseif, and each pill is eqalto a
common glas of water. For the enre'oo
the above.discases, and all other chronic
(or sloA j diseases, preseverance ii the se
of these Pills, accordiug to the diestiois
gives- in the small bills, accompanying ihe
pills. is all imponat; and if they are per
veringly. umed as directed, a cure may be
more certainly expected, than under any
tither treatment heretofore discovered, etX
cept from the use of the water,frqm wMiAi
they are prepared either by an aluiaz3 -
at the Springs or otherwise. They rj
speedily cure diarrhmas attended With
acidity of the stomach, aml what is com
noni. called heart-burt; twe or three pills
nay be taken at any time, when thestom.
ach is troubled with acidity, with the hap
piest effect. These Pills have an excel
lect efect in preventing the attacks of
nervouis or sick-headache ; from three to
six pills should be taken at once, when the
symptoms are eLt.
Theso waters.are nt efectual remedy
for all hemarrhagest and as the Pills have
the Fatmf effert in oti.er csses, it is believed
thy will also have the osameefect in cises
of hemorrnage. They cure dropp'ies it
somett Cnse, but are not an infalible remedy
in nil capes o this diense.
From the ellicacy of these waters and
pill- in purifying the blood, they are in
valuable in the cure of all diseaees of the
skin, aiall indolent sores. not disposed to
a licalthy action. Iu the use of them far
such diseases. if the disease. of the skin
appears to be rietated at irat, or if the
n!cer. becomA more iodamed and discharge
more freely,let not thits eircuthstance alarm
any one. or deter himt from persevering in
their use.:. These are evidences of the
gnd offets of the Pills in expelling the
vitintecd humors front the blood to 'the
,urface. and util the blood is purified,
such diseasi cannot be cured. In scrofu
louilpers, the use of these waters and
ptl!s, invariably cause them to discharge
more f-cely, and in a short time, of a more
healthy. appearance. They are a very
useful remedy in Cholera lnrentum or the
summer bowel-compliint in children : as
also fur expelling worms from children..
They immediately give a good appetite.
promote digestion, and will effectually
correct and cure acidity of the stomach.
From their cleansing and purifying efects
upon the blood; and from the tone, vigor
and cncray, which their operation imparts
to the n hole system they will be found a
great preventative. of be fevers, whiel
prevail in l6w and unhealthy regions;
hence, persons living ins such regious, will
fiil it greatly to their advantage to use
the pills, for a fortnight, at the cornmence
t.ent of every spring and full season, as a
pre..emntive, anrd Luhbuild up constitutions
b~rolkcn down by pirevious attacks of fever.
Thesec~ Pills are a valuable aai:ant to
thle use anid efficacy of sulphturousuand a
line mineracl ataers, atnd threa or four of
thcm taken cach day, at different times.
wvhich in attendance at other tnernl
sp-rings, would add ;:reatly to thec curatuve
effects of these aatrs.
Thcse waters a'td pills are worthy of
thae ncotice of the .Mcdacal Faculty ; anid in
tl.cir hands would be a valuable article in
the treatment of many disuases, otherwise
unmzanagea ble. In amenoarrhe~a, dysti
orrhaen atnd luchorrhea. the waters of the
Alum Sptring~s arc peculiarly effecacious ;
amid we helievo the pill. made from these
waoters, would have the same effect-in the
treaamenut of thovso disease-s. that the water
ha-s ; therefore, weL wluld recommend a
il of themt, by the lFaculty, in hed
c anes. These Pills arc easily taken.'hav
ing no nauscuus taste, are perfectly safe
in all cases where active fever does not
exist and do nut sicken persons while vtsing
themn.
