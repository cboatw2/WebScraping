of their accommodations and of the currcn

the worst calamities to individuals are onl\
at last arrested, by an open violation ol th'-n
obligations by the banks, a rofasal to p t;
specie for their notes, and an imposition upon
the community of a fluctuating and depreciated
currency.
These consequences ore inherent in tht
present system. They are not nfluencei
Kit tha knnl'o V\oV*n !o rro np omtill W
fjr lliv VUU(\9 U^.iig iui vi uiiiuii) ? i u w
by National or State Governments. The)
are the results of the irresistible laws ol
trade end credit. In t'-o recent fvnt>
which have so strikingly illustrated th" cer
tain effects of these laws, we have s"? n the
bank of the larg'/st capi al in the Union,
established under a National charter, and
lately s'rengthencd, as'wc were authoritatively
informed, by exchanging that for a
State charter, with new and u.usual privileges?in
a condition too, ns it was said, ol
entire soundness and great prosperity?
not ?erely unable to. resist these effects,
but tie first to yield to them.
N#r is it to be overlooked that there
k exists a chain ef necessary d<jpend?'nc?
among these ins.itutions wlich obliges
a them, to a great extent, to follow the course
I of olhers, notwithstanding its injustice tr
their own immediate creditors, or injur)
Jfc to the particular community in which the)
ere placed. This dependence of a bank,
k which is in proportion to the extent of it*.
debit for circulation and deposit- s, is nol
s merely on others in its vtcini y, but on al
& those which connect it with the centre o
trade. Distant banks may fail, withou
seriously affecting Arose in our principa
commercial cities; but the failure of the
latter is felt at the extr?nrii:i"s of the Union,
The suspension at New York, in 18M7, waj
every where, with veiy few exceptions,
followed, .as soon as it was known ; thai
recently at Philadelphia immediaiely affect,
ed tlie banks of the .South nnd West in a
similar manner. This d-'pendmce of out
whole ban king system on the institutions in
a few large ci;h-s, is not found in the laws ol
their Organization, but in those of tra Je and
exchange. The banks at that centre to
which currency flows, nnd wheie it is required
in payments for merchandise, hoi I
the power of controlling those in regions
whence it comes, while the latter possess
no means of res: raining them; so that the
??liut /?f inrlii'Mii'il nmni?riv. nnd t i if * nros
I?I?J? I periiy
of trade, through the whole irrertor
of the country, are made to d?p'-nd on the
good or bad management ofjlie ba: king institutions
in tin* great scats of trade on the
seabord.
Dut this chain of dependence does not
stop here. It dops not terminate at Philadelphia
or New York. It reaches across
the ocean, and ends jn London, the centre
of the credit system. The same law s ol
trade, which givo to the banks in our principal
cities power over the whole banking systern
of the United S.atcs, subject the former,
in their turn, to the money power in Great
Bri aim It is not denied that the suspension
of the New York banks in 1837, which
was followed in quick succession through^
out the Union, was produced by nn a plication
of that power ; and it is now alleged,
in extenuation of the present condition o:
so large a portion of our banks, that th< ii
embarrassments have arisen from die same
cause.
From this influence they cannot now|enlirely
escape-, for it lias its origin in the
credit currencies of the two countries, i! .is
RJr*ngthrnod by ilie current of trade and
pxclmngc, which centres in London, and is
rendered almost irresistible by the larg'
dob:s contracted there by our merchants,
cur hanks, and our State?. It is thus thai
on introduction of a new bank into the mos
distant o.' otir vi.'l iges, places the business
of that village within the influence of the
money powe r in England. It is thus 'hai
every new debt which we contract in tha
country, seriously affects our own curr-m
ey, and extends over the pursu's ofoui
citizens its powr rfu! influence. We rannoi
escape from this by mak ng new banks
great or small. Sate or National. The
same chains which bind those now exis inj]
to the centre of this system of p iper credit,
must equally fetter every similar institu iot
we create. It is only by the e.x cnt to whicl
this system has boon pushed of late, that w<
' " r 11 / _ _
have oeen matte tuny aware 01 rsiriesis i
ble tendency lo subject our own banks am
currency to a vast controlling power in i
foreign kind ; and it adds a new nrgumen
to those which illustrate their precarious sit
ualion. Endangered in the firs* place bi
their own mismanagement, and again bj
the conduct of every institution which con
nects them with the centre of trade in oui
own country, they arc ye; subjected, beyoin
all this, to the effect of whatever nie?sur? i
policy, necessity, or caprice, may induci
those who comrol the credits of Englant
to resort to. I mean not to comment upoi
these measures present or past, und rruct
less to discourage the prosecution of f?u
commercial dealing belwten the two coun
tries, based on reciprocal benefits: but i
having now b-en made manifest that tin
power of inflicting these and simd?r inju
fies, is, by the resistless law of a credi
currency and a credit trade, equally c?pn
ble of extending their consequence's througl
all the ramifications of our banking system
and by that means indirectly obtaining
particularly when our banks are used ui
depositories of the public moneys, a dan
gerous political influence in the Unitei
States, I have deemed i: my duty to brin^
the subject to your notice, and ask for i
your serious consideration.
Is an argument required beyond the cx
position of these facts to show the impropriety
of using our banking institutions ai
depositories of the public money? Gun w<
- venture noi owy to encounter tlio rskof
I, their individual and mutual m sm magement <
t but at the same time, to place our foreign <
. and domestic policy entirely under lite con- <
f :rol of a foreign moneyed interest ? To I
2 do so is to impair the independence df o'dr I
i Government as the present credit system |
- has already impaired the independence ol I
. our banks. It is to submit all its important j
1 operations, whether of peace or war, to be '
t eon!rolled or thwarted at first by oar own I
1 banks, and then by a power abroad greater I
; 'hao themselves. I c mnot br ng myself to i
r d> pict the humiliation to which this G >v rn . I
! meut and people might be sooner or later i
- r-dueed, if the mear.s for defending their t
? rights are to be made dependent upon thsse <
who may have the most powerful ol motives t
; to impair them* i
I Nor is it only in reference to the effect I
1 of h s state of things on the independence t
r ol our Governineni or of our banks ;lnt t
r | ibe subject presents itself lor consideration ; t
: it is to be viewed .also m i's relations to the i
general trade of our country. The time is 1
i not long past when a deficiency of' foreign r
, crops was thought to :iff?rd ?profi able r
market for the surplus of our industry ; but I
now we an ait with feverish anxiety tbe
newsofthe English harvest, no* so much t
from motives of cnmiti'mdahle s\mpnt?y, *
' but fearful le>t its anticipated failure should <
narrow the field credit there. Does not <
, this speak volumes to the patriot? (.'ana i
system b" beneficient, wise or jus', which t
creates greater anx ety for interests d< p- n- t
t | dent on foreign credit, than for the geiierul <
, j prosperity of our country, and the profitable i <
? i exportation of the surplus produce of cur 1
> labor ? I
r Tuc circumstances to which I have thus i
r adverted ?pp ur to me to afford weighty <
, reasons, developed by late events, to be <
i added to those which I have on former oc- 1
t 1 eastons offered, when submitting to your r
I 1 better knowledge and discernment tin? pro- i
/ i it
I pri?-ty ol separating the custody ot ill" pumic i
r iMoney from banking institutions. Nor has |
I any thing occurred to lessen in my opinion* j
the force of what has b en heretofore urged, j
The only ground on whieli that custo ly
i can bo d-sired by the hanks, is t?.e protita- i
, bio use which they may make of die money. (
I Such use would be regarded in individuals ;
. as a breach ol trust, or a crimo of great <
t magnitude, and yet it may reasonably i
ho doubted, whether first an i las', it is not ;
i attended with more mischievous consequent .
F ci s, when prmided to the former than to i
I the latter. Tne pracice of permitting th" ,
> public motley to lie used by its keepers as t
here, is believed to bepeculiar 10 this conn- (
I try, and to exist scarcely any where els \?
; To procure it here, in.proper influences }

brought to bear both o.l the E\e"Ut'Ve and |

formed. It is made the interest of banking t
ins'i u'ions and their stockholders through. ^
out lite Union, to use their exertions for the [
i ere se of taxation and the accumulation ;
of a su plus revenue; and while an excus" t
is ufford- d, the in *ans are furnished for
those excessive issues which lead to cx'ra j
vag.iiit trad ng an I speculation, and sire th ,
) forerunners of vast debt abroad, and a susfc ;

Impressed, therefore, ns 1 ana with tlie ,
propriety of the funds of tin? Government (

at all even's, essential in the interests of tin* j

Mos" of the arguments that dissuade us ,
t from employing banks, in the custody an I |
i disbursement of ;he public money, apply -t
, with equal force to the receipt of tneir notes ,
t for public dues. The difference is only in ,
t form. In one instance, the Government *
5 is a c/e Ji.'or for its deposites; nnd in the (
? oth'T for the notes it holds, They atiord ,
f the same opportunity for using the public ,
t moneys, and equally lead to all the evils ,
* attendari' upon it, since a bank can as safer
j 1)' extend its discouns oil a deposit" of its ,
t 1 notes in dm hands of a public oflicer, as on
, i one made in i s own vaults. On the oiher ,
? hand, :t would give to the Government no

J From the best estimates we may sai?iy

1 eighty* five millions of dollars, on] the

he requirement of specie in purchases of ^
juhlic lands. Such purchases, except when jc
liadc on sp'culation, are in general, but w.
angle transactions, rarely repeated by the tv
lame person ; and it is a fact, that for the hi
a si year and a half, during which the notes tc
T i

han a moiety of these pay men's has been

In a country so commercial as ours, hanks ' ci
in some form will proiubly always exist; but ?|
this serves oniy to render it the more incutn- w
Denton us, notwithstanding the discourage. p\
merits of the pas', to strive in our respective cl
Btations to initigatf the evils they produce ; c
to take from them as rapid'/ as the ohiigi 1 ir
tions of puuhc faith and a careful consideration n
of the immediate interests of the community h
will permit, the unjust character of monopolies; p
to check so far as may be practicable by n
prudent legislation, those temptations of inter- e
est and those opportunities for their dangerous jt
indulgence, which bese; them on every side, d
and 'o confine them strictly to the perform. ' tl
ance of their paramount duty, that of aiding , I
the operations of commerce, rather th in con- I V
suiting their own e*clu-ive advantage. These j a
and other salutary reforms may, it is believed, i e
be accomplished without the violation of any tl
of the great principles of the social compact, i ti
the observance of who h is indispensable to its n
existence, or interfering in any way vvith the ' u
use ul and profitable employment ot real capi- j ir
tal. . j b
Institutions so framed have existed and still j ti
exist elsewhere, giving to commercial inter-j
course all necessary facilities, without inflating ; "
or depreciating the currency, or stimulaiing j a
speculation. Thus accomplishing their leglti- j c
mate ends, they have gained the surest guar- u
antee for their protection and encouragement ?
in the good wil' of the community. Among , tl
a people so just as ours the saino results could ti
not fail to attend a similar course. The direct ri
supervision of the ban s belongs, from the na- 1<
ture of our Government, to the States who au- tl
thoriz them. It is to their Legislatures that ti
the people must mainly look for action on that tl
s ihject. But as the conduct of the Federal e
Government in the management of its revenue d
has also a powerful, though less immediate in- e
fluence upon them, it becomes our duty to a
see that a proper direction is given to it. t
While the keeping of the public revenue in a t
separate and Independent Treasury, and of t
J
dlectin* it in gold and silver, will have a saltary
influence on the system of paper Credit
ith which all banks are connected, and thu*
id these that are sound and well managed, it
ill at the saine Mine sensibly check such as
re otherwise, by at once withholding the
leans of jxtravagance afforded by the pubiic
inds, and rostraning them from excessive
sues of notes which they would bo constantly
ailed upon to redeem.
I am aware it has beer, urged that this cono!
inry be best attained and exerted by means
: a National Sinn. The constitutional ob
ctions, which 1 am well known to entertain,
ould prevent mo in any even? from proposing
assenting to that remedy; hut in addition
i lhis4 I cannot afier p.isr experience, bring
yself to think that it can any longer be exnsireiy
regarded as effective f.-rsuch a pur>se.
The history of the late National Bank
irough all its mutations shows that it was not
i. On the con;rary, i' may, after a careful
ms.deration ot the subject he, ( think, s-ifely
ated, that ai every of banking excess it took
io !e*d;thaf in 1817,and 181S,in 1823,in 1821,
1834,its vast expansions,followed bydis ress
g contractions* led to those ofthefitat instiI'ions.
It swelled and maddened the tides
the bankingsyst-in, out seldom allayed or
ifely directed th<m. At a few periods only
as a salutary control exercised, but an eager
?sire on the contrary, exhibited for profit in
ig first place ; and if, alterwards, its measures
ere Revere towards other institu'ions, it was
?cause its own safety compelled it to adopt
tem. It did nut differ from :hetn in principle
' tn furm ; its measures emanated from the
tmo spirit of gain ; it felt the same temptation
over issues; it suffer d from, and was
tally unable to avert, those inevitable lawi
trade by which it wag itself affected
jually with them ; and at least on one oceaon,
at an early day, it was saved only by
ctraordinary exertions from the same fate
tat attended the weakest institution it prosscd
to supervise. In 1837 it failed, equally
ith others in redeeming its notes, though the
voyears allowed by itgebarter for that purpose
id not expired, a large amount of which
mains to tho 'present time outstanding
. is true that havng so vast a capital, and
reng'hpned by the use of all th^ revenues of
le Government, it possessed more power;
it while it was itself* by that circumstance, J
eed from the control which all banks require,
3 paramount object and inducement were left
ic same to make the most for its stockhoid-s,
not to regulate the currency of the couny.
Nor has it, as tar as we are advised,
?en found to be greatly otherwise elsewhere,
'lie national character given to the Bank of
ng and, lias not prevented excessive fluctuaons
in their currency, and it proved umble
< keep off a suspension ol specie payments,
bich lasted for nearly a quilerof a c> nturv,

riarter frorrt a different source than tho Srate

XDosed to temptation ; and is liable to the
imo disasters ; with the additional msauvanige
that its magnitude occasions an extent
f confusion and distress which the mism.ingoment
of smaller institutions could no'
roduce. If can scarcely he doubted thaf the
cut euspens'on of the United States Bulk
f Pennsylvania?of which the effects are felt
r?? in hat S'ate alone, but over half the U.,ion
-had its origin in a course of business com
lencod while it Was a national institn'i >n;
rid th< re is no g.vjd reason for supposing that
le same consequences would not have fol ow1,
had it gtiil derived its poaer from the
reneral Governm nt. It is in vain, when the
ffj^occs and impulses are the same, to look
ir a difference in conduct or results. * By such
earions, we do therefore but increase the
iass of paper credit and paper currency,
iihout checking their attendant evils and
actuations. The extent of power and the
ficjenc.y of organization which we give* far
orfi being beneficial, arc in practice positively
ijurious. They strengthen the chain of
spcndence throughout the Union, subject all
arts more cer ainly to common disaster, anA
ind every bank m >re effac ual!y in the first
istince, to those of our common .1 cities,
ud, in the end, to a foreign power. In a
ord. I cannot but believe that, with tfp*
ill understanding of the operation of our
inking system winch experience has produ?d,
public sentime t is not loss opposed to the
reation of a National B ink for purposes
>nnected with cdrremy and commerce, than
>r those connected with the fiscal operations
1 the Government.
\et the commerce and currency of 'he
untry are suffering evils from the op> rations
f the Sta'e banks which can not and ought
ot to be overlooked By their iii- ans we
ave been flo >d?d with a deureriated paper,
hich :t was evidently the design of the framrs
of the Constitution to prevent, when tliey
quired Congress to ' coin money and regulate
le value of foreign coins," and when they
irbade the States 4 to coin money, emit bills
f credit make any thing but gold and silver

f they did not guard more explicitly agun^t
>e present state of things, it was hrc-use they
uuld no' have anticioated that it,e few banks

ould expel to so great a degree the gold unu
Ivor, for whi? h they had provided, fro.ii the
hannels of circulation, and fiil them with a
urrency that defeats the objects they had
i view. The remedy for this must chiefly

as sprung. No good that m-ght accrue m a
articular case from the exercise of powers,

doub that the States will apply the remedy.
Viihm the last few years, events hive
ppeal^d to 'hem too strong y to be disregard

l^oretically adhered to, is subverted in prac
ce: that while on the statute books there is
0 legal tender qui gold and silver, no law

1 point of fact, the privileges conferred o.i
anking corporations have made their notes
ic currency of the country ; th it the obiga
oris imposed by these notes are violated

nd that he number and power of the persons
onnected with inese corporations, or placed
nder their influence, give tlierh a fearfu
eight when their interest is in opposition to
he sp rit of the constitution and laws. To
ie people it is immaterial whether thos
ssults are produced by open viola iong of twitter,
or by the workings of a system of which
fie result h the same. An inflexible execu
on even of the existing statutes of most of
he States, would redress many evils n w
ndured; would effectually show the oanks the
angpre of misman igeipent wlrch impunity

11 corporations the useful lesson that they 3re

oral Government to co-operate with I lie States, <
hy an exercise of itsjconstitutiodal powers, and i
the enforcement of its existing laws. The I
exteir io which it may do so by further en- I
actmrnts, 1 h ive already adverted 10, and the 1
wisdom ol Congress may yet enlarge them.? I
But, above all* it is incumbent upon us to i
I hold erect the principles of morality and law, <
constantly executing our own contracts in ac- t
cordance with the provisions of the Constitu- t
tion, and thus serving as a rallying point by |
wiiich our whole country may be brought I
back to that safe au-l honored standard. Our i
people will not long be insensible to the extent <
of the burdens entailed upon thein by the false ;
system that has been operating on their san- ;
gitine, energetic, and industrious character;'
nor to the means necessary to extricate themselves
rrom these embarrassments. The
weight which pr -sses i pon a large portion of
the people and the States, t8 an enormous
debt, foreign and domestic. The toreign debt
of our States, corporations, and men of business,
can scarcely be less than two hundred ,
millions of dollars requiring more than ten
millions of dollars a year to pay the interest, i
This sum has to he paid out of the exports of (
the country, and must of necessity cut off imports
o that extent, or plunge the country 1
more deeply in debt from year to year.?
ft is easy to see that the increase of this
foreign debt must augment the annual demand
of the exports to pay the interest, 1
and to the sa ne extent diminish the im- i
ports; and in proportion to the enlargement
of the foreign debt and the consequent in- j'
crease of interest, must be the decrease of the j1
import tra ie. In lieu of the comforts which (
it now brings u*t we might have our gigantic,
banking institutions, and anplendid, but in
i many instances profitless railroads and canals
' absorbing to a great extern, in interest upon
the capital borrowed to Construct them, the
surplus fruits of national industry for years to
come, and securing 10 posterity no adequate
return for the comforts which th* labors of
their hands might otherwise have secured. It
i* not by the increase of this debt thai renei
i.s to be sought, but in its diminution. Upon
rhis point, there is I ana happy to say, hope .
before us ; not as much in the return of confidence
abroad, which wil! enable the States to
borrow more money, as in a change of public
feeling at home, which prompts our people to
pause in 'heir career, and think of the means
by which debts are to be pa;d before they are
contracted. If we would escape embarrastnent,
public and private, wo must cease to
run in debf, except for objects of necessity, or
such as will yield a certa'n return. Let the
fan h of the States, coroperalions, and individuals,
already pledged, be kept with the
most pnnr.tillious regard. It is due to our
national character as well as to justice, that
this should ou the part of each be a fixed principlc
of conduct. But it behoves us all to bo
inore charry in pledging it hereafter. By
ceasing to run in debt, and applying the surplus
of our crops and incomes to the discharge of
existing obligations, buying less and selling
more, and nanagmg all affairs, public and private,
with strict economy and frugality, we
slia 1 sec our couniry soon recovor from a
temporary depression, arising not from natural '
and permanent causes, but from those I have j
enumerated, and advance vvun renewed vigor
in lier career of prosperity.
. Fortunately for us at this moment, when the
balance of trade is greatly against us. and the
difficulty of meeting it enhanced by the disturbed
state of our mclney affairs, tno bounties
of Providence have eorne to relieve us from
the consequences of past errors. A faithful
application of the immense results of the labors
>f the last season will afford partial relief
for the present and perseverance in the same
course Will in due season, accomplish the rest.
We have had full experience, in times past, of
the extraordinary results which can, in this
respect, b?* brought about in a short period,
by the united dnd well effected efforts of a
community like ours. Onrsurplus profits* the
energy and industry of our population and the
wonderful advantages which Providence has
be?iowd upon our country, in its climate,
its various productions, indispensable to other
nations, will, in duo time afford abundant
moans to perfect the most uselulof tli?*c objects,
for which the States have been plunging
Ihcmse.ves of late in embarrasment and debt,
without imposing on ourselves or our children
such fearful burdens.
But let it be indelibly engraved on our minds
that relief is not to be found in expedients.?
Indentedues-i cannot be lessened by borrowing
more money, or by changing the form ol the
debt The balance of trade is not to be turned
in our favor by creating new demands upnri Us !
abroad. ?>ur currency cannot be improved
by the creation ct n -w banks or more issues
from those which now ex:st. Although th se
devices sometimes appear to give temporary
relief, they almost invariably aggravate the
evil in the end. It is only by retrenchment
and refo m. by curtailing public and private
expenditup<'0, by paying our debts, and by re- !
forming our banking system, that wo are to
expert effectual relief, security f.ir tlie future, ;
and an enduring prosperity. In shaping the
institutions and policy of the General Government
so as to promote, as far as it can with its
limited powers, these important ends, you may
rely on my most cordial cooperation.
That there should h ive been, in the progf
ess of recent events, doubts in many quar'rrs,
and in some a heated oppose ion to every
change, cannot supprise, and it is peculiarly lit
the nature ot uch abuses as we are now
encountering, to seek to perpetuate their
power bv means of the infl lence they have
been permitted to acquire. I: is their result,
flint their object to gain for the few an ascendency
over the many, by securing to them a
monopoly of the currency, Mie medium through
which most of the wants of mankind are supplied?to
produce throughout society a chain
of depend- nce which leads all classes to look
t ? privileged s nciations for the means of
speculation and extravagance,?:o nourish, in
preference to the manly virtues that give d^g.
nry to human nature, a craving desire for
luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth which
render tho^e who s< ck them dependent on
those wiiosupply them?to substitute for Republican
simplicity and economical habits a
sickly app tite for effeminate indulgence, ar.d
an imitation of that reckless extravagance
wiucii impoverished and en-iaveu me lnauairiou?
people of foreign lands ; and at last* to fix
upon us, instead of these equal political rights,
the a* quisitton of which was alike the object the
and supposes reward our Revolutionary Strug,
glp, a system of exclusive privileges conferred
by partial legislation. '1*0 remove the influences
which had thus gradually grown up
among us?r.? deprive them of their deceptive
advantages?to test them by the light of wisdom
and truth?to oppose the force which they
concentrate in the r support?all this was necessarily
the work of time, even among a peo
pie so enlightened and pure as that of the
United States. In most other countries, perhaps,
it Could only be accomplished through
?* #?'/ , ,. fi
that aeries of revolutionary movements, whic
ire too often found necessary to effect any
jreat and radieai reform, but it ia the crowning
morit of our institution?, and they create and
flourish in the vast majority of our people, a
Jiaposition and a power peaceably to remedy
ibusea which have elsewhere cansed the elusion
of rivers of blood, and the sacrifice of
thousands of the human race. The result tbus
rar is most honorable to the self denial, the in-*
diligence, and the patriotism of our citizens;
t lusiifies the confident hope that they will
:arry through the reform which has been ao
well bogun, and that t^oy will go still farther
:han they have yet gone in illustrating the im- ?
)ortant truth, that a people as free and enightened
as ourp, will whenever it becomes
lecessary, show themselves to be indeed
capable of se.fgovernment by voluntarily
adopting appropriate remedies for every abuse,
and submit'ing to temporary sacrifices, bowever
great, to insure their permanent welfare.
