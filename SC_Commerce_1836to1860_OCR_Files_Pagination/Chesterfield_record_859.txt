EXTRACTS FROM
T??e Hon. I.nnydon t lievca' i.cttrr.
Lonotince absolutely and unreservedly, during
this content, all pretensions to the high
honors of the Union. Fill no office under
the Genera] Government except in the Legi-htivo
Hal's. This will be no sacrifice,
for no sop of yours will, whatever be Ins wen's,
ever fill the Executive Chair until your
wrongs are righted, tin'il you shall be re*
sprrtrd as equals in the government, and
until the withering scorn of Legislative As* ;
sembliea shall banish from their floors your
calumnious .accusers.
I do not p.ay that you eught net to join, i
even zealous'y and with a'! your nijght, in the |
choice of a chief magistrate of tli" Union ;
hut let it not he in support of a Font hern
aspirant which, at tlrs timn will weaken,
distract and mislead you. Support, always
the candidate most likely to sustain your
own and your country's interests. I speak
rot of Carolina alone, hut of all the Southern
Stales?give your whole and undivided
weight to the men and the party opposed
to your oppressors, and cl-itn no <ffice for
vourselv-'p. By this unambitious course you
tnav gain some weight in the national council??at
present you have none. The peotvp
of the West, rot withstanding sntne lit.
l!o apnarent alienation which has depended
vastly more on the movements of men than
f-n principles, and which therefore cannot
last long, are your natural allies. Let the
South and West combine with the demncracy
of the other parts of the Union. The
' Vest have at present abundant cause to open
their eye to the evil? they suffer from Tar ff
and abolition combination, for these powers
arc closely united, and together have wrought
out the lamentable result to which I allude.
If Providence had enabled the West to possess
themselves of the greatest blessing that God
could grant them, of what would give them
wealth and security and power, they ought
to have desired Texas. But they see themselves
bv these unholy combinations entirely
and heartlessly deprived of these great blessings.
All the South Western Slates, (by
which I mean all South and 'West of the
< Jhio River) are of our blood and lineage; their
institutions are more or less Southern, and
frh ir interests are really the same as those of j
ti e S< uth. There is reason therefore to hope j
that e'er long we shall stand, as we were j
w ont to d >, in our country's more liberal and j
palmy days, side by p:de in our political movements.
By tfrs natural alliance, in former 1
times was the high handed power of that sarrm j
people that now oppress v it, pu' (low n. This j
was the policy of Jefferson, and th;s alliance'
formed the great Democratic party of the j
Union, That great bond is now fearfully 1
shattered and almost severed by tariff and
abolition combinations, and will soon altogether
parish if th-se comhmations he not j
insisted. Look at the great Democratic fam. j

along in a spiritless paralytic movement,
I ke that of the halt and the lame; look at*
the great and good old dominion, Iio.v it;
has sunk and fallen, luw its glory has gone :
down ; look a* your own shameless South- :
ern desertions. What ic the cause of t';:? '
deplorable cond;'ion of our po'itirrf ? What
is the eause of that general gloomy dip. |
content and uncertainty whic'i prevail among
the people concerning their political move '
mentp : of the infidelity so shamefully exhibited
by their representatives, who have substitu'ed
the little schemes of faction and i
personal resentment for the great inte ests j
of their coun'ry? Vou sec Southern Senators
voting for a tariff which they themselves
have repeatedly condemned and rcprobatfd, I
and Western senators against the annexation
of Texas, which their constituents to a
man anxiously wished to acquire. Wha*
is the cause of those- gloomy clouds which
lower in the political t-ky ; of that fearful dread
which ail gond men suffer ot a f*'al disrupt
- * - - - r\ t , i.:^
tion rt our noblo institutions j i;ark as uiis
picture may b?, and certainly is, exclude
but a single grmip of the numerous Dramatis
persona, let but the scene change so
as to exclude from the stage a few bun*
dred overgrown capitalists, the governors
of power looms and spinning jennies, and a
very sma'l number of reckless fana'ic abolitionists,
and all will be light and life. We
shall immediately see ih? sky brighten, and
the clouds disperse. We shall discover a
free, profitable and increasing commerce,
feedingand maintaining a prosperous agriculitire,
high prices for the produce of the soil,
and cheap supplies for its cultivators, with
union, harmony and traterna! love, holding
together the whole people 0/the whole country.
The good old Democracy triumphant,
and the motly band ol Whigism?" Here
a bit of biack stone and there a bit of
white"?hilling its bead in feebleness and
defeat. The whole Union fijurishirg and
the South loyal, conten'od and lnppy. Texas
bounding and strengthen ng our borders
and increasing our wealth and greatness. In
the name of Gowhat-fatuity has come
over the pe< p'e, that they do not discover
the petty and odious thraldom in which
they are bound ai,d by which the grea'es?
boons and blessings of I'rovidence are thr*.
ened with entire subversion, and even, in
effect, turned into curses. But to return
from this too long but interesting digression,
in which we have looked with a kind
of prophetic vision, wo think, on what we
hoped to see realized at no distant day.
When three or four States null arise with
unblenching front, and unite heartily and
resolutely, others will .speedily join them,
and our relief will, in all likelihood, be peaceably
accomplish d and the Uni n preserved.
Yet lot not this blessed hope be relied upon
with too much confidence, hut anticipate
a worse result and be prepared to meet if.
But shall we put at hazard that Union
which we so much love and honor, in which
we purchased a partnership with so many
sacrifices, and be forced out of it Iv thai
very people by which we have heretofore
defended it? it is, in my opinion, a lamenta.
ble truth, that, that hazard mu-t be met, and
it i6 idle and even dangerous to hesitate in
avowing it as the possible result, however
much we may deprecate if. There are
worse evils than ui.-un:on and we tan hardly
doubt that we have been long suffering under
them. But, if the dissolution of the Union
be a great evil, and it certainly will he so
to the American people, and would be so
to us, if we wer.i permitted to enjoy its benefits,
the guilt and the reproach will rest
upon those who wantonly provoked it, and
those who wantonly have suffered it to take
place. Yes, wantonly, for the Historian
must record the fact, that''the sacrifice of
that glorious institution which might have
secured and perpetuated, to a distant posterity,
the happiness, prosperity and greatness
of twenty millions of people, at this
time, and of more than an hundred at r.o
very remote futurity, was made to gratify
the inordinate avarice of a few score (not
more) of great capitalists in a small secMB&v
lion of the country, and the furious midiitse
of a srnalier number of fanatical abo
e t v i1 ? > ii. wm n?wi i jj ? ? . I
litionistp, who combined together to oppress
i the interests and lo destroy the peace and
j happiness of the people of the Southern States,
| who, to th" h'?nor of humanity? resisted and
, overthrew their wicked design-3.
Before God, we do not wish disunion.
Let the Government be justly admitrster'
ed, and we will glory in the Union and give it
j ?>ur whole hearts and strength, in peace I
I and war, as we have done before, when !
some of its most noisy eulogists, at the
present time, were not in the ranks with us?
when they were almost tn the ranks of a foreign
enemy. But who has heretofore spoken
of di-umon 1 whence did the odii . s term or:- J
j ginafe? not surely from the South. It came j |
in the chill blast of the North and East. By j

j man of note, what great public assembly of i
the South has heretofore spoken of disunion ? i
( But among those who have recently taken it ! (
under their peculiar gu mlianship, the greatest ;,
' men they boast have tepeatedly and flippantty j
' uttered it. When the great and valuable j
; acquisition of Louisiana was made, did not | (
! one of the most distinguished men on the fl.ior j:
: cf Congress declare, that it would he followed j
| by their severance from the Union," peacea~ j
I bly if they could, forcibly if they inrst ?"
j When the treaty for the annexation of Texas
, (no le-s important than valuable) was announ;
ced, their greatest men rushed forward, with
i breathless haste to utter equivalent language,
i Recently, one of their greatest, wisest and |
j gravest legislative bodies, modestly proposed I
! to expunge from the constitution the most
sacred ar icle in it, by which we were wooed
into the compart, and without winch we would
i have had nothing to do with it ; and what
! would this have been but actually and fai'hi
lessiy perpetrating disunion ' Yet those are
the people who vociferously accuse you nt the
desire of disunion, when " the head and Iron'
of your offending,'' does not amount to a tithe
j of their own guilt. If, indeed, there be the
i shadow of guilt on your part, in complaining
; of the great abuses of it, and, if under the

SARDS' SARXAr VlULM,
1 For the removal and permanent cure of all Diseases
arising from an impure state of
1 the Blood, or hahit of the System.
WF ue read tlie history of disoroki-.s we are
astonished that men live; if of cures we-are
i still more astonished i bat they die. A mi yet in fact
| nearly all disease* have a common origin, viz :
I in the organs which prepare and modify iho
blood, with a remedy, directed to ihn seal of di
sease, will remove n h"siof its phenomena. It
is the peculiar characteristic* of Sands* Sarsaparilla,
that its searching operation reaches tiio
causes of di?Ja*o, and the cures it perform* am
therefore radical and thorough. 'I ho health of
the human system depends almost entirely upon
the slate of the blood. If the vitalising fluid
I which pervades every tissue, ev?ry membrane,
' fibre, filament, gland, or oilier organ, primary
i or subaiduarv: if the bodv be charm d with tlio
elements of ?Jis?o;t?e, sickness nnixt be the consequence,
and until the cau-es of disease exist*
ing in the bloo I, are eradicated, no permanent
relief can l>c expected. It is here that tho ?
powerful licallh restoring proprieties of Sands'
Sarsapri'la arc manifested; and tor this reason, >
in Sciofula, Suit Rheum and all eruptive disease, f
as well as in all d *rangements of the s< ending
org-.ne, it ia considered infallible.
J The following I. tter f:oin one of the most rmi. j
