URo.-An extra from the Harrisburg In
telligenrer office, under date of 5th inst.,
furnishesi.he particulars of the proceedings
in the Seonte of Peunsylvanian on Tues,
da7, the first day of the session.
the Seuate was called to order at 3 P.
- MJidye lata.Speaker, an.a on calling the
roll 6 Senators answ.ered to their names
The Clerk then proceeded to read the
returns of the late election, and amonR oth
a it appeared that Mr. Bell. of Cheiter,
and Messrs Hanna and Wagner, the Whig
members from Philadelphia conuty, were
duly returned elected.
Mr. Brown offered a return from Phila
delphia county, which was not received ty
the Speaker. ri '
Mr. Pearson said, it was impossible for
hita:to understand she returns frm the
eigitth Senatorial district, comp)osed of
H untingon, Mifflin, Juntiata,' Perry and
Union counties, and he tmoved that the
persons returned be .mnot allowed to ake
their seats-(being rour in numbier, the law
only calling,for two)-till the other Senm
tors eleet were duly sworn in, and that
they be postponed tall that time, The me
tion was agreed to, yeas 13, nays 8.
The Senate then proceeded to the elec
tion of Speaker, when Charles B, Penrose
was duly elected, having received 19 votes,
and Samuel S. Carpenter, 9.
Mr. Rogers said he had heard the return
from Philadelphmia county read, as senm by
the Secretary of the commnonwvealth,. but
he had in his possession anosher return
the legal one-which he wished to present
to the. Senate.
The Speaker was opinion that the re
turn could not m)e received, but a p)etition
might be presented, under the act of 1791,
on which a committee maight be raised, in
order to investigate the matter. So it was
not received.
The clerk then called up the newly a
lected members, to be sworn, when Mr.
Rogers objected to the Senators elect from
Philadelphia county taking thear seats.
He afterwards moved to postpone the swear
ing of the Senators for the presernt.
Mr. Peason addressed the Senate at some
length, and finally in opposmion' to the
mnotion. The motion was yeas 9, nays 12.
The new Senators were then swornm in,
"when" (in the words of the intelhsgenceer)
"a scene of riot ensued beyond all de
scription, and which fimally obaliged the
Senate to adjourn, when the mob took
~possession of the Hall," and after being
addressed by several persons. dispersed.
The latest news from Harrisburg is, that
there is a prospect of some compromise
between the two parties It is paropiosed
that the Whig Delegation from the coun
sy of Philadelphia. shall be allowed to
take their seats, upon the conadiion thamt a
pledge be given that the Legislature "hall
not proceed to the election of Treasurer,
Auditor, or Unmited States Senator, until
the claims of the contendimng party be set
sled. The Commitse of Elections, under
'the Constitution of Pennsylvania. is cho
sen by lot, and themr decision is final, as in
the British House of Commons.

The Hon. TwoMAs H. Bsoi has been re

It will be seen that the President is firm in ad
vocating the Independeut Treasury plan. lie
uses strong arguments against a National Bank,
or a connexione of the Government with State
Banks. He disclaims all hostility to State batnks,
but recommends to the government, to form no
union with them, and to use them only, as the
public policy and general interest of the coun
try may require. This is but just and reasona
ble None but the nost prejudiced advocates
of the banks, can say that this is waging war a
gainst those institutions. Mr. Van Buren trly
says, " that the only safe or proper principle up
on which their intercourse with the govertiment
can be regulated, is that which regulates their
intercourse with the private citizen-the con
ferring of mutual benefits." If the banks wish
for any more than this, it is but to increase, to a
large extent, their own profits. We publish,
this week, that portion of the Message which is
of most interest to our readers. We will give
them. the conclusion in our sext paper.
Aarter Turisp.-The Office of the Augusta
Constitutionalist appear to be a depository of
mammoth Turnips. We wish our planters
would procure the seed. Iere is the Editor's
description of a huge turnip:
"About a week ago we noticed the re
ception of a turnip, weighing 7 lbs. 81 oz.
-but it was i *mall affair to one we now
.have l the'6ff1ce' a'ort of Slatnese con
cern, having one root and two tops, and
.weighing eleven pounds. We did not
measure it, as it is or such an outlandish
shape, it would be difficult to run a string,
but should think it will measure considera
ble wore than a big turnip!

N,:w OnrLI iAs, Dec. 8.
VaaA Cauz TAxxC.-By the French
Steatm Ship Meteor, arrive'd ss:t niahm ins
60 hours from Vera Cruz. intellig~ence is
received that the Castle of Satnan tde
Ullon, was taken by the F'rench fleet sifter
a bonmbardmnen' ofthree hoturs, with a loss
of only four men, by she blockadting squad
ron: whila from 4 to 500 Mexicans were
killed. In the same shaip came a mtessen
ger. who has hurried ona to Washington,
being the hearer of important dispatchses.
From the Courier we take the following
particulars of th.e bomnbardment.
On the 27th of Nove'mber. the Freich
Admiral. Bauditn, sent word to the Mexi
catn General, Rittcon, that he was about to
attack the Castle of San Jesan de [Ulhun.
A bout 2 o'clock the same da.v,three French
frigates, a sloop of war and two bomb.
ketches, moored between the reef within
gunshot of the Caste: and so well directed
was their bombs andI heavy artillery, shut
isifss thb .fbv bstB they haldsD- eda
the gre of t) pieees of Mexican artillery,
:ein,olished all the out works, includiiig
the famous redoubt called El Caballetol
andi killed and wounded 0(1 of the Mexi
can garrison.
About 6 o'clock in the afternooo of the
27th, he Mexican c,nionander in the Cas
tIe, hung out a signal for the cessai6h of
hostilities, and begged leave to be allowed
limte to withdraw hio, wolnded from-the
ruins of the fortication. Admiral Baudin
replied that le could consent to no truce,
hut would allow the Mexicans to retire
from the fort if ltey capitulated. To this
the Mexicfn General agreed, and with
drew hi4 troops from the Castle, which
was immediately occupied by the French
soldiers and marimes.
The Mexican army, near Vera Cruz,
Was abloti 5,000 strong, but their officers
did not consider thieinselves able.to-hold
the town, commanded as ij was by the
gui, of the Castle, until the Frencli Ad
uiral consented that one thousand of the
Mexican troops should remain in the city
to preserve order.
It was bPlieved that negociations had
been commenced between the Mexican
Government and the,French Admiral, for
the re-r-maf:lishmtent of peace, but some
ime may elapse berore the result is known.
The 1rench Admiral it was thought,
wiuld no lonver hinder tie vessels of all
nations from trading to Vera Cruz.
We have here: given all the particulars
which have reached its. Of the ulterior
designs of either the French or Mexicans,
we are ignorant. Time alone can tell,
whether the Mexicans, dispirited by thi,
their first trial of strength,with the French,
will consent to patch up a peace and pay
the money demniaded of then; or whether
the war will be prolonged, and lead to
further conquest by the arms of Lou6
Philippe.

She united herself to the Ba p:ist Chitrch"M the

an orderly and pious metimier. The precepts
of the Redeeme-r appeared to lie the standard
to which she conformed.and His promiises were
a sheet aiclor and solace to her, inl every vicis

destitute of gnuile, ' and was of an active, fer

brow. when death had iimade her hais victim, in
dicated the mentalresignationi,and buoyant hope..
which cheered her reflections in the last mo
