lade use of this PANACEA, successfully in a case

lia.ii thrf.e years. On several occasions he applied
) practical Physicians for obi, (North and South,)
ml received no benofit. Ho was, at length, preailed

irtuo r>f certain ROOTS anu HERBS; and becvmg,
that the Receipt would greatly benollt him,
.c took it, together with an old French Receipt: from
rhich is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper hero to say, that the quality of some,
r alt. the principal Roots, are well known to the
dcdical Faculty, by whom they are frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil, Ulcerated Sores,
;encral diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
dercury ; it has a decidod salutary effect.
For Bowel Complaint he would also recommend
he use of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Chilren
arc frequently attacked with this complaint:
specially when teething. A few doses ot the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they become re;ular
again. It has l?een tried by a great number of
espectablo individuals, and pronounced a "certain
uve?" lie has tried it at different times in his own
amily, and it relieved the child immediately.

[T is with great, pleasure the subscriber informs j

he VEGETABLE ELIXIR. This medicine is |
omposed of Roots which grow in this State. It is :
iseless to enter into a detail of the value of this Me- !
icinc, (or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
nown that all Roots have valuable Medical pro- i
erties. He would also stale that there is not the

named diseases, there is no medicine made or '
onded at the present time, better calculated to relieve '
lie afflicted, limn the Vegetable Elixir.

To those who aro articled with Pustules, Eruptive

Vithoul the fear of contradiction, he recommends this

made double, the.y reduce labor, and gin just s
ouble, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- T
er Gin, no other knd having been in use^pieVous 1
3 this patent; and whether single or double, they I
re found to improve the quality of the cotton, by 6
lore perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
onlain from 20 to 160 saws in a stand, and whether
mall or large, one band will be sufficient to attend ,
iem. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
oppers attached to them, which freo the cotton
om leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can icnch the
IW8, and by the thorough hackling operation it
iceives from tho feeders, which make two revoilions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half *
incd slate, before it descends to the saw. By a
cry simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
antes, on which the hoppers rest, and through hich
the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be ^
lade to leed slow or fast to suit the condition of
le cotton at the time. When made double, the.
iws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn *

ay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power. '
may also be propeiled by iron running gear,
he force required to work it, is about the same as
at necessary to move an equal number of saws in
e common Gin. This Gin has been put in
icratiou in New Orleans for two or three weeks,1
id its success tested in the presence of a large
imber of planters, merchants and Others, and at
ceived their general approbation. f 1
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give 'l

id was very much pleased with its performance. rpi
he mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to me to Ps
a very valuable improvement; and besides, the ('e
