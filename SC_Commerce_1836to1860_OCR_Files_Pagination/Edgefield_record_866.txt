SONGOF T HE SALT RIVER WHIGS.
Tzii~.:-Canadian boat song."
e list to our faneral chime,
HfiflWY out in tone and time,
HiM -en the star of the west grows diim,
iingat the "jug" a parting hymn;
Row brothers, tow; the staeama runs deep
Wake itp Vebster; you're fast asleep!
SteAdily our shallop is homeward hound
Hloarselythe ripple ismurtring round
Listen!:ou. fugleman raises-tle songe
And its burden is, "Joese, oh Jim akl. ig/.
* Roi brothers, row;-the streamruns fast;
Salt river is gained, and our glory's past
Our motey is gone, nd our bills are due;
Credit, dear! credit, dear! Where are you
Loafers and pipers, nao more we'll dine
On bacon boiled in Falernian wine.
Row brothers. row; the stream runs fast;
The glory-of cider and sin is past.
Swifdv we near the arid shofe,
Puffing and tugginzg the heavy oar;
Sadly we sit oan our thread-aare clotla.
Fishing for. meat in our colnskini broth.
Row broiliers, roi; th'e'stream runs swift;
Rouse up, Harry, and giveats a lift!
Merry we've been ii) days gone by.
Pleasure has beained from our lordly eye,
But now the autuma of joy is come ;
Onr sentence is past. anad we -nacomb.
Rest brthers, rest, tho distance is past;
Salt river is gained and we are rast.
Hlere,where the carrion buzzard flies,
Pickinag out faminie's insatiate eyes,
We'll ,eat our shadows, and blow away,
Licc aist froan a mountain tall and gray.
Dif, brothers, die; oar day is past
Salt river nurnurs our dirge at last."

THE LAZY.MAN'S SOLILOQUY.
I am a very lazy nan,
I never will deny it.
For every thing I say or do,
Would certainly belie it.
I am the very laziest ann
That mortal ever saw,
For if I had any ineat to cook,
I'd rather eat it raw.
I am a very lazy nan,
The ladies-tley too know it.
For at they'd take a kiss. I'd be
Too lazy to bestow it.
I am a very lazy anan,
The fact there's no denying,
I have no wife to spur me tap,
Or noisy babies crying.
I'm one of those right lazy men,
A lively woman scnrns,
And graces such a husband with
An antling pair of iorus.
There's no stchI very lazy tatan
E'erhad I wife as yet.
And ih'be h.ad. 'would surely be
All he would ever get.
And when 1'.% Called a lazy :nan,
I surely w.,uld not braaok it.
But that I'd raither lose any aaeal,
Than take the painus to cook it.
I shaoul perhaaps make those bad men
l-'oa saach abuse-repent it,
Dat I'am for everhiastiaagly
Too lazy to tesenat it.
