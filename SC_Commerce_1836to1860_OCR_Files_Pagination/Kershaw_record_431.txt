any act of theirs. But In tin's we have
been mistaken?for we behold Eion Gulusha,
one of its Vice Presidents, presiding
over an abolition convention, and signing ,
* .1.1 coiilimnnts nlitinr- ,
ill .lUUil'SSf i;uilVuuiiM^ wV... ww..w. rent
to our feelings, and anathemas against j
us which could only be conceived in the I'
mo^t malignant spirit?and all this under;
the garb of Christianity. Therefore,
Resolved, That we view with contempt, i <
the advice, opinions, declarations and j r
menaces of Elon Galnshu and his road- j
jutors, contained in their address to Southern
Baptists. (
Resolved, We recommend to our Asso- r
ciatiou to use their influence to have Elon c
Galusha expelled from his office of Vice
President of the Board of Foreign Mis- t
pious?that they have a right to require it, e
and should make his expulsion the condi.
tion of their further connexion with the li
board. 'I
Resolved, That we feel great interest in I
the* cause of Missions, but can never consent
to have an officer to assist in the (
management of the affairs of the Board t!
?rh'o so ur forgets his duty as a christian v
ws to meddle wiib what docs not concern
him. >
Resolved, That our A^osiation he re- o
quested to be fully rcprcsonteri ij the Triennial
Convention at its session April next, (
and the delegates be requested to endea- a
vor to obtain an expression of the views ii
and opinions of the Convention on the sub- c

Jcv' v" ""
Resolved, That those who are not for "
its arc against us, ami that any refusal or
neglect oil the part of the convention to
express an opinion <m the subject, will be "y
regarded bv us a? taking sides with abolitionists.
" *
Resolved, that Southern Baptists should j
sneak out their sentiments, and let Elon
(talusha and Ins philanthropic friends ?
kno'.v, that we are not dependent upon
them for their ''labors of love," and that c
we disregard their menaces.
Resulted, That we extend to Northern 1
Baptists opposed to the abolitionists our |>
warmest y fleet ion and fraternal re- t\
gard. They wili ever have an interest p
in our prayers.
Resolved, That \\e highly approve of
ihc: course of Rrothei Meredith, of tlie
Recorder and Watchman, and that his ''
views and recommendations on this sub- ?
jeel should receive llie serious consi- >'|

Mlt. Editor? A> a ehronielcr ol pas.-dog ^
events, I send yon for publication, a very b
faint account of t!:e proceedings of Sa- V
turdav last. Love <;f country is a virtue d
of the highest order. He must have lost e
all sense of duty either to Clod or his feh ft
low beings, who has no aspirations for [.
his conutiy's good. s,
As such, we deem the d<>itigs of S.itur- (>
day entitled, as 1 believe they will meet jj
with, a hearty welcome in your columns. ^
It being one of the r< guiar muster days
o?
of the company, lite turn out of seventyfour
men in such a rich uniform, as that
of the Delvalb Rillo Guards, presented an
appearance rarely to be met with in any
I'.iri 'if the country. Added to which, is |(
liii'ir geucial martial display, spirit and
bearing, and amongst the most conspicuous
traits manifested by them is, their T*
attention and obedience to orders. Es- }|
hernials to the discipline of every military 0
corps. The several evolutions performed, u
were well executed. As marksmen, their
ability was well attested by the perforated,
portrait of an Indian chief, (handsomely r;
painted by one of the members,) at the n
disraucc of one hnndrcd yards. The it!
iirstpii/c, a fine Kirte, was won by J. K. ft
Smith, the second a plume by J. C. lU'Wil-j0i
lie, the third an Indian pouch, by D. \
Dcauford; these tokens of skill were [,
awarded by the judges, to ih* successful r.
competitors before tlie ciiizm?s and compuny
formed in a hollow square. !
After which, all present, partook of ai(|
sumptuous and well prepared Barbecue.; nA
number of gentlemen were called upon, ^
who responded handsomely, dwelling:
upon the peculiar advantage of a Ilillej
corps, in time of war, ev incing a lofty pa-:
iriotism mingled with a desire iliat sue prin
ciples of Sobriety, Temperance, and j
obedience, iniglu ever be conspicuous ; c
amongst the officers and men of thcDc-jp
Kalb Rifie Guards. The utmost harmony
prevailed throughout the slay. Mnj. iW'CIei-1 ^

Gen. Cantey. The Constitution of

ty of the latter depends upon a M-ell organized
citizen soldiery?let the South be f
prepared.
By Lieut. Kennedy.? The Richland
Volunteer Corps?We hail them as brothers
in arms, knowing the materials they
arc composed of; in war we can rely upon
ihem as efficient aids. Their good esteem
we highly appreciate.
By Lieutenant Iv. S. Mofiatt. The Offi:ers
and Privates of the Kershaw Troop.
?We tire proud of them as soldiers, and
lonored by them as friends.
By W. M'Willie. The DeKalb llijlc

Renown it ion of Texas?The Newark
Courier say:?We learn from an
uthcnlic source that advice-' were receivd
by the Great Western to the effect that (
,e Governments of Holland and Bel- i
ium authorized their ministers in London J
> treat with General Hamilton, for the
onclusion of a treaty of recognition,
mity and commerce with the republic of
'exas: and that Gen. Hamilton, the dilomatic
plenipotentiary id" Texas, was
b Hit to repair to London for that pur
OSO.
I
The Methodists in Canada.?The Me-j
liodists in Canada now consist of nearly!
no hundred thouand souls. They have
pi ling up in a lew years from van-small
cginings, and under many disadvantages.
I is not many years says the Quebec Cactle,
since the only Methodist prcacborin
iOWi-r Canada, was incarcerated several
mnths in the Quebec Jail, for libel; and
i Cpper Canada, liiere were only a few
t audi ring Missionaries. They have now
umnrnus substantial churches; a college
f their own; and many able and rcspecib.'c
preachers.
Jhn'ribh: Assassination ?Vn dor t his
cad life Clinton, (Lou.) Democrat o1 thej
tli, gives the following account. <4Ou{
londay Morning last, about daylight, our
stccined fellow citizen, Col. Warren C. j
Vhitaker, was inhumanly murdered by!
eing shot down, while standing in his j
aid giving orders to his negroes for the I
ay. A number of buck shot took fatal'
flirt near the region ot Ins heart, and lie
?!! dear! with a single, exclamation.?,
'our of his negroes are now in jail under j
ispieion of being accessary to [this deed 1
f blood?as yet, however, little is known
lough no doubts arc entertained but that i
ic murderer or murderers wi he dis- j
we red.
[Ncir-Oricans Bulletin, 1 Gth inst.
Novel Rat Trap.?A correspondent
assent us the following account of a
cvvlv invented rat-trap, which has al?ady
broil used with success. Take a
arrel and stretch a skin of parchment |
rer it with a string; cut it across and ath- (
art, nearly to the outside. Take some
ripping, and mix it with meal; smear it '
11 the middic of the parchment. The j
its will smell it and treading on the parch-1
lent it will give way, and they will fall,
ito the water in the barrel. Put a plank j
i 1?_ I
>r mom 10 creep Up lu liiu uamri b ui iijiv 1
ut sick?, and strew some oatmeal on it. j
'on must not let the water he too deep, i
utset a brick endways in it, and the first j
it that is caught will make a noise, which
il! entice more, so that they will tight for
osession of the brick, and the noise wiil
raw others. Thus in one night the house
lay be cleared of rats, be they ever so
lanv. Mice and other vermin may be
aught in a similar manner.
LACONIC BUT TRUE.
'Tie was a hypocrite at first, or a hyporite
at last, and the truth is/<e was a hyocrilc
bath first and last"
This is what llcriry A. Wise said ot
Ir. Clay in 18i>2, when the former was
eviewing the course of the latter on the
ckbratcd Compromise Bill. Did Mr.
Vise speak then what he thought to be
he truth? If he was sincere then, what
Iocs lie think of himself now. He and
dr. Clay are both mounted on the same
lobby. ? <;:'a barrel of hard cider.'
SOUND.
In the arctic reagions, persons can converse
more than a miie distant, when the
hcrmometcr is below zero.
In air, sound travels from 1130 to 1142
cet per second.
In water, sound passes at the i*atc vt
4708 feet per second.
Sound travels in air, about 900 feet for
every pulsation of a healthy person, at 75
in a minute.
A bell sounded under water, may be
heard underwater at 1200 feet distance,
j Sounds arc distinct at twice the distance
on water that they are on land.
In a balloon, the barking of dogs on the
ground may be heard at an elevation of
three or four miles. On Table Mountain,
a mile above Cape Town, every noise in
it, and even words may be heard distinctly.?
Saturday Chronicle.
We^'copythe following "Description of
the man who did not pay for his paper,"
from one of our western exchanges:
"You claim to be a human being? \Vhv,
sir, if you have a soul, ten thousand of its
size would have more room in the shell of
a mustard seed, than a frog in the Pacifie
Ocean. Nay, more?ten thousand souls
like your's might colonize on the point of
a cambric needle, and live for fifty years,
increasing in a ratio equal to the Irish pea- j
sants; and should they then have a civil!
war, the vanquished party would have
mountains and valleys to retreat to, ten
days' journey off. Why, man, neighbor
Gripe's soul is as much iarger than your's
as a saw-mill log is larger than a thread of
a spider's web; and his can hardly be discerned
by the aid of a microscope that
magnifies a million of times."
Temperance Anecdote.?A man was
taken before a magistrate for having, while
drunk, knocked down in the street a Minister
of religion. The prisoner was fully
convicted of the offence, but at the urgent
intercession <>f the reverend gentleman i
whom lie had injured, was liberated on I
signing tiie tee-total pledge for a month.!
At the expiration of the month he called !
at the house of the Divine, and being in- j
troduced, expressed his gratitude for the
effects of the pledge he had submitted to, |
and concluded with expressing the utmost j
sorrow at not having met and knocked ;
down his reverence thirty years before. j
A farmer about kindling up a fire, bit- j
ter cold day, deep snow on the ground, I
said to his son, "T un, mv son, can't you i
go out to the woodpile and hustle mc up a !
few chips to start this fire?" Tom: "Olii
yis, while I am a hustling about there,!
arter them chips, who knows but I mought \
hustle out a snake."
