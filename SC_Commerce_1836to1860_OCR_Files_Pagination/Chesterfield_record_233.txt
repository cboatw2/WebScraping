X>i!c i-ui'urs. Jligfi I'remium.? \\ e learn | p0J
from the Columbus Enquirer that the Legisla- : pC(
lure of Georgia, at its last session, passed an i
act offering a premium of 30 cents for every j
pound of cocoons raised in the State and 10 jJa
cents for every pound of reeled silk for the next 0 '
ten years. It requires 10 pounds of cocoons ur
to make one pound of reeled silk; the prcmi. j rc
urn on silk when reeled is, therefore, ?5,10 per j no
pound. The entire cost of raising and reeling ; of
is estimated !>y experienced and respectable J B:
culturists in the Northern States at only ?2 :
per pound. The premium offered in Georgia,!
according to this estimate, amounts to more |
* 0 n
than 150 per cent over and above the cost; in j
addition to which reeled siik commands, at j
present in tire market from 5 to 7 dollars per j
pound, according to quality and reeling. Every
two dollars judiciously laid out in the silk culture
in Georgia wiil, then, whilst present pri- J
n c
ccs continue, yield a clear profit cf from 8 to
10 dollars. This is most extravagant; yet j.

rage for Morns Muliicaulis is so great ? The .
premium in Georgia is too high- Ifcontinu. 111
?r
ed, cv< ry other branch of agriculture would *
\e-y toon be given up for silk, and the tax to
ptiy the premium would be so high that other ca
kinds of labor could not bear it. The premium .
will doubtless be reduced by the next or some j ,
? be
subsequent tcsdor. of the Legislature. This j
m:ght be considered by sonic a violation of j
good faith on the part of the State. And so j
it would be towards thc .c who may have com- ;
meuced the silk culture in the State before j Pr
the reduction takes place. In regard to them C;
it would be a breach of that clause of the ,
Fedora! Constitution which forbids the pas. j
sage of a law by any State violating tlie obli- [ fi'gatiori
of contracts. Cut, yet, so far as we ; lai
can see, they would have no remedy. Tliev [
