Message on the subject of our French xetetion*'
which will be found in our columns, that he re.
commends prohibiting the introduction of French

' able to learn, that the administration party in both

with the recommendation. A bill for that pur.

the committee on foreign relations to the House,

of such a bill in the Senate will be more doubtful.

A Convention of "The Democratic Republican

We were much pleased to see that there were
Ovlj five votes cast for Richard M. Johnson, the
regular nominee of the Baltimore Convention
for the Vice Presidency. Suppose liim elected

friends a widower or a bacholor?*
It is an evidence of a most deplorable state of
public morals, that bo largo and respectable a
Convention as that which met in Baltimore last
summer should nominate for the Vice Presidency,
or for any other office, a man of Col. Johnson's
private character. We hope however the event
will prove that they mistake the character of tho

It is said that Gov. Marcy has recommended to
the Legislature of New York, to pass a hue to
punish the publishers of incendiary pamphlets or
papers in the State^ We have not seen his message

The laws of North Carolina require that the
Treasurer of that State shall give bond and security,
to be approved by the Governor, within 15
days after his election; and upon his. failure to
do so, if the Legislature is not in session, the
Goyerncir and Council are required to make another
appointment. General Patterson, the Treasurer
elected by the General Assembly at its late

Special Mewtfe.
The President, on the 15th inet, Bent to both
Houses of Congress the special message, on the
subject of oar French relations, which he had
promised on the returnof Mr. Barton. The following
is the concludh^ pert ofjt slid that which
[Contains his recommendation to Congress;
"Mr. Barton having, in pursuance*of
his instructions, returned to the U. States,
and the Charge d' Affairs of France having
been recalled, all diplomatic intercourse be.
tween the two countries is suspended?a
state of things originating in an unreasonable
susceptibility on -the "part of the French
Government, nod rendered necessary ci$ our
part by their refusal to perform epgiige*
merits contained in a treaty, from the jaithfiil
performance of which by us they arc
to this day enjoying many important comraerriaUdvantages.
It is time that this unequal position of
aflairs should cease, and that Legislative ac.
tion should be brought to sustain Executive
exertion in such measures as the case re.
quires. While France persists in her refused
to comply with the term? of a treaty, *
the object of which was, by remq^ing all
causes of mutual coiqplaiht, to renew ancient
feelings of friendship, and to urate the two
nations in the bonds of amity, and of a mu.
tually beneficial commerce, she cannot justly
complain if we adopt such peacfui rerun- *
dies as the kw of nations and the circumstances
of the case may authorize and de- C
mand. Of the nature of these remedies, I th
have heretofore had occasion to speak; n<
and* in reference to a particular contingency,
to express my conviction that reprisals
would be best adopted to the emergency p
then, contemplated. Since that period, 0j
France, by all the departments of her Gov- sj
ernment, has acknowledged the validity of ^
our claims* and the obligations of the trea- ^
ty, and has appropriated the moneys which st
are necessary to its execution ; and though aj
payment is withheld on grounds vitally im- g
portant to our existence as an independent rfl
nation, it is not to be believed that she can
have determined permanently to retain a position
so utterly.indefensible.* In the altered
state of the questions in controversy, n'
and under all existing circumstances, it up- M
pears to me, that, until such ^ determina- si

proper and sufficient to retaliate her present ,B
refusal to comply with her engagements,
by prohibiting the introduction of French
products and the entry of French vessels fr
mto our ports. Between this and the inter- hi
diction ef all commercial intercourse, or #
other remedies, you, as the representatives \\
of the people, must determine. 1 re com- $
mend the former, in the present posture- of g
our affairs, as being the least injurious to Sj
our commerce^ ana as attended with the
least difficulty of returning the usual dfate
of fnendly intercourse, if tlie government
of France shall -render us the justice that ^
-is due, and also as a proper preliminary 7
step to stronger measures, should their a- u
doptiom be rendered necessary by >ubse- /,
.quent events? ^
The return of onr Charge d'Affairsis
attended with public notices of naval pie- J
parations on the part of France, destined m
for our seas. Of the cause and intent of
these armaments, I have no authentic infor- $
motion nor any. other means of judging, 0
except sucn as are common to youreeives s
and to the public; but whatever niay"be e
their object, we are not at liberty, to re- ^
gard them as unconnected with ttyp, measures
which hostile movements on the part n
of France may compel us to pursue. p
They at least deserve to be met by adequate
preparations on our part, and 1 there- t(
fore strongly urge large and speedy ap- j,
propnations for the increase of the navy,
apd the completion of our coast defences, jj
If this array of militaiy force he really
designed to affect the action of the Gov- n
emment and people of the United States, ?
on the questions nowpending between the m
two nations, then indeed would if be dip-' "
honorable to pause a moment on tho al- -
teroative which such estate of things would
present to us. Come what may, the ex- jj
planation which France demands can never
be accorded; and ii'o armament, how- ?
ever powerful and imposing, at a distance, ?
on our coast, will, I trust, deter us from ?
discharging fne high duties which we owe ?
to our constituents, to our national charac- c
ter, and to the world. - F

be adhered to. If, after so signal an ex- ?

The efforts of humanity and religion, to

of such lawful and expedient mea- t
