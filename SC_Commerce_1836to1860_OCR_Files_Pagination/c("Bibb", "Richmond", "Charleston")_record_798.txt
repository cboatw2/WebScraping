CHRISTIAN EDUCATION.
Christianity aims, first, at thorough individual
improvement; and, secondly, by means of this, at
substantial social improvement.
In both respects, its principles and plans are
infinitely superior to those of the world. Nor
is it difficult to prove and illustrate this position,
to the satisfaction of any candid mind that will
give due attention to the subject.
Social improvement is the aggregate develop
ment of individual improvement,—modified in
deed, by conventional usages indescribably
various, but comparatively unimportant. He
who should be made acquainted with the mea
sures for personal improvement adopted by the
members of a new community, could have no
difficulty in anticipating the social conditon to
be produced by them. Even in our own coun
try, however, society is sufficiently advanced to
enable us to exhibit both cause and effect, in mat
ters of fact, rather than indulge the reason or the
fancy in abstract speculations concerning them.
What then are the elements employed by
men of the world in their efforts to secure indi
vidual improvement? Their main principle is
this:—that you may take man as he is, and, by
human means, make him what he ought to be.
Hence the education of the mind is restricted to
the attainment of merely human intelligence;
the education of the heart is confined to a phi
losophic discipline of the passions which seem
to be most violent and dangerous: and the
standard of manners is accommodated to this state
of mental sufficiency and moral selfishness.
Thus the world comes to the march of life,—
the bitter fountain of our existence,—and, dis
daining to cast into it the branch appointeid of
God to make it pure and sweet, endeavors to
remedy the evil by the adornment of the rocky
basin, and the enlargement of the winding chan
nel. Is it any wonder that the current remains
bitter still?
The appearance may be improved, but the
essential ill is untouched. The man thus super
ficially and absurdly educated, may proudly dis
play nis outward investiture of graceful and gor
geous distinctions ; but the cause of the ruin of
our race yet riots and revels in his soul, and un
less it be expelled by the omnipotent agency of
the Spirit of Holiness, will as surely destroy
him, as it has already destroyed millions of his
fellows.
This is the fatal error of worldly education.
It assumes that the heart is right,—that the moral I
nature needs no change. Therefore the prepos- j
haughty supervision of the affections as they are.
Therefore, also, the self-complacent devotion of |
the intellect to classic and scientific erudition
alone. Verily, these mental and moral exer
tions are well matched. Such intelligence is
sufficient for the purposes of such a philosophy.
Poor as it is in comparison with tne truth of
Christianity, it is rich enough for this associa
tion,—-just as the meanest vines and flowers that
ever unfolded a bud or curled a tendril are al
most too beautiful to be planted in the dewless
desert or festooned about the burning volcano.
Divine knowledge would never have been re
vealed, but to qualify us for the accomplishment
of a complete spiritual revolution ; and render
truly illustrious the subsequent union of sub
limest thoughts with holiest sentiments.
Being duly informed of this mistaken train
ing of individuals, how easy is it to anticipate
the consequent condition of society! How easy
to foresee that the social system must be one of
external embellishment and internal corruption,
—as foul as fair.
And does not the actual estate of worldly so
ciety demonstrate the correctness of such antici
pations? What is it? Are its manners refin
ed and polished in the highest degree? Are its
artificial comforts, luxuries, ornaments, wonder
fully multiplied, various, splendid? Are its
literary accumulations, Already esteemed inesti
mable, constantly and rapidly increasing? Are
terous efforts of an arrogant
its political authorities assuming unprecedented
importance and stateliness ? Are the ample ex
pansions of our government becoming more and
more mighty and magnificent 1 What now ?
Alas I we are surely and sadly aware that all
these graces and glories are compatible with
moral corruption. Nay more, they are now, in
fact, to a distressing and alarming extent, the
concomitants and encouragements of moral cor
ruption. They are shockingly subordinate and
subservient to sin. The light they shed is like
sunshine on a penitentiary. They glorify ini
quity.
Just as far as worldly society is free from this
reproach, just so far it is indebted, not to its own
doctrines or methods of improvement, but to the
influence of the religion it affects to despise. In
the absence of this religion, as all history loudly
testifies, the direct and dreadful tendency of natu
ral principles is witnessed in universal sensual
ism, wickedness and wo. It matters not what
heights of civilization may be attained,—nor
what cloudless brightness may be awhile enjoy
ed. The resplendent habiliments of an angel
of light may disguise the form of the prince of
darkenss,—but the desecration is of no avail,—the
devil is a devil still.
If you would properly erect the edifice of
personal improvement,—the foundation must be
laid in moral purity. If you would rear a per
manent and prosperous social structure,—the
faiMdmion milt to raid in mars] purity. Act
otherwise, and your labor will be lost. Act
otherwise, and you will build your temple on a
basis that cannot sustain it: every stone added
to its walls will increase the danger of its de
struction ; the dome will tremble on its yield
ing circle; and, if it linger even till it be finish
ed, the slight weight of the last ornament shall
cause the downfall of the whole. The thought
ful listener on the plains of time hears the whole
horizon resounding with the overthrow of noble
piles thus foolishly founded, and starts from the
moving shadows of the central towers that totter
above and around him.
He who describes the social history of t;-e
world must represent the counterpart of a vapory
night-scene. Even the stars are partially hid
den ; and the moon is dimly visible through a
half-lucid haze; but the chief distinction is,—
that the sun is absent. The lesser lights of
manners gleam in the social firmament; the
borrowed beauty of intellect diffuses its witching
softness; but the vital effulgence of virtue is un
known.
Christian Education, in its origin, progress,
and results, is the very opposite of this; and
every professor of Christianity should feel it
equally his duty and delight to proclaim its un
changeable aversion and hostility to such false
notions and silly modes of improvement.
The principles which control the entire Chris
tian process are:—that the heart is wrong,—that
it must be made right,—that human means can
not effect this change,—but that it may be effect
ed by Divine means. Hence, the necessity for
Divine intelligence in development of regener
ating influences. This intelligence is afforded,
and duty and interest alike require that we “take
heed" to it, “as unto a light that shineth in a
dark place, until the day dawn, and the day
star arise in our hearts,”—until “the Sun of
Righteousness appear with healing in his wings,”
—and “the path of the just" on earth, like the
path of the sun in the sky, “ shineth more and
more unto the perfect day.” This necessity being
supplied, the way is open for entire redemption,—
or, as stated in the commencement, for thorough
individual and substantial social improvement.
Let the heart be renewed,—and whatever else
is important may be easily and certainly secured.
“Seek first the kingdom of God, and His
righteousuess, and all these things shall be ad
ded unto you,"—i. e. all things necessary to our
welfare, personally or socially. Omnipotence is
under bond for the fulfilment of this promise.
This most desirable of all objects accomplished,
if, by the grace of God, any thing gratifying be
yond the demands of external necessity and com
fort may be attained, its association with moral
excellence will heighten its own merit. Intel
lectual powers, whether of genius or learning,
are never so commanding or winning; and the
attractions of manner are never so admirable or
endearing, as when in union with the elements
of innocence and the impulses of benevolence.
Goodness deserves both beauty and glory. The
freshest verdure was not too fresh ; and the fair
est flowers were not too fair; and the noblest
groves were not too noble, for the Eden of Love,
—the Garden of the Lord. Sharon was worthy
its roses; and Jericho, its palms ; and Lebanon,
tts cedars. No robe is too white tor a saint; no
crown is too glittering for an angel.
“ Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall
see God.” As the earth, even at noon, sees not
the sun, except the sky be clear; so man, let
other circumstances be as favorable as they may,
cannot see God, unless his heart be pure. And
as natural consummations were impossible with
out the sun; so spiritual perfection is impossible
without God. The landscape, in the shadow of
the cloud, may teem with varied productions;
but there is no ripening until the messed sun
shine quiver in the calm blue air, and touch
them with its golden beauty, and quicken them
with its vital warmth. And so, while the heart
is obscured by passions dark and wild, the mind
may be fertile with all forms of truth, even such
as derive their seeds from sacred stores; but
never can their crude elements be matured, un
til, through the serene expanse of mortal purity,
the radiance of Divine Love may descend, vivi
fying the development of delicious nutrition, and
tinting the surface with the tokens that all within
is sweet.
But, leaving this illustration, for we cannot
satisfactorily manage it now, let us say that the
man who endeavors, first, to become pure in
heart, shall enjoy the blessing of God in all
proper efforts for his father improvement and for
the welfare of society. In reading, thinking,
speaking, writing, acting, the Holy Spirit will
sustain and reward him. Beginning right, and
progressing right, he may be assured there will
be no necessity for a single retrograde move
ment. Every step will be gain never to be lost.
He may “ press toward the mark for the prize
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,”—
confident of moral perfection here, and entire
and everlasting perfection in the world to
come. If a disciple of the world were favored
with a probation of a thousand years, still, be
cause of the first mistake in respect of his moral
condition, his utmost exertions to ennoble his na
ture would be in vain. He might as well spend
the whole interval in adorninga mummy with the
regalia of all nations,in hopeof its finally assum
ingtne living sovereignty oi an; as auempito se
cure his own personal perfection by mere intellec
tual and physical accomplishments. If he ever suc
ceed in this object; it will be by seeking at last
what he should have sought at first,—a change
of heart. He will resemble a pilgrim, who, re
quired to make an offering of gold, and frank
incense, and myrrh, at a temple a thousand miles
of day and the cold of night, and discovers, when
he stands before the shrine, that the richest gift
is forgotten, and that his journey must be re
peated, with its weariness increased by the op
pression of shame. But, alas! life cannot be
repeated. A loss at death is a loss forever.
Howdiflerentwiththechristian. A thousand years
to him would only illustrate the wisdom of his
early choice. The past would excite his grati
tude,—the future enliven his hope. He would
exult in the faith that his only transitions should
be from glory to glory.

uals. All pure in heart. All enlightened in
understanding. All affectionate in deportment,

TEENTH CENTURY.—NO. II. -
“ Flows there a tear of pity for the dead 1
Look on the ravage of the reeking plain,—
Look on the hands with female slaughter red,
Then to dogs resign the unburied slain.”
BYRON.
It was said that Busitis, the king of Egypt,
sacrificed strangers upon his bloody altars; and
to the name of this man the unanimous voice of
ancient poets and historians has prefixed the
term infamous. Historians give us the name
of a conqueror, who mourned that there were no
more worlds for him to subdue, and him they
call the Great. Busiris sacrificed a few unfor
tunate strangers upon altars erected to the honour
of the gods: Alexander had flaming cities for
his altars, and whole nations for his victims.
Busiris immolated those who had subjected
themselves to his laws by coming within his do
minions; Alexander,not contented with that,inva
ded the dominions of strangers,and huntedout be
ings devoted to destruction. Busiris desolated no
countries.and rendered sterileno lands; Alexander
converted the most fruitful fields into a desert;
the cottage of the poor and the palace of the
rich became smoking ruins at his approach.
Busirissacrificed as a homage to a dreadful super
stition: Alexander sacrificed to gratify his own
insane vanity, and to minister to his own vicious
appetites. The difference between the two is
vastly in favour of Busiris and yet he is the in
famous, and Alexander is the Great. This un
fair use of terms has arisen from a diseased state
of public mind.' Men suffer themselves to be
dazzled by tho very splendour of a crime. And
offensive war, with the long catalogue of miser
ies,—of rqbfceriesandof murders in its train,—tho
battle ground, soaked by tears of the aged and
the young, mingling with the blood of slaugh
tered parent and son, of husband and brother,
and sounding-with groans and shrieks, and
prayers and curses, have been themes of glory;
objects worthy of monuments. Poets have cel
ebrated them, and ministers of a great God have
returned thanks to the common Father of man
kind for the success of the conqueror.
In relation to these things a sort of moral
blindness has long rested upon the eyes of man
kind, so that they could see only glory where all
was crime. But men now are beginning to take
a different view of these matters,—to understand
that there is in war more of misery than of fame;
that heroism is only wholesale man-killing,—and
that the arts of peace, the pursuit of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and the extension
of the blessings of civilization, are far more
honourable, as well as useful.
Causes of war are now passed over, which
was once regarded as. only to be settled by the
sword. Since that magnificent butcher, Bona
parte, has passed from the stage, Europe has en
joyed a period of unexampled repose. It is true,
that this repose is owing, in some degree, to the
mutual jealousy of the different European states,
and to their fear of disturbing the. balance of
power; but yet the abhorrence with which war
is now regarded by the religious and enlightened
is the main cause. The abhorrence increases
every day as the great truths of religion and
state policy become more generally understood.
It is discovered that nations, like individuals, are
dependent on each other; and interests, once
considered as clashing, arc found to be closely
united, the success of the one depending much
upon the prosperity of the other. Commerce
connects the most hostile nations by the closest
ties; and mutual wants, and mutual resources for
supplying those wants, remind them of their
brotherhood. Thus the United States are rich
in products of the soil: England has facilities
for manufacturing: France produces silks: Rus
sia iron; and China tea. Nature no more de
signed that one nation should be independent of
the rest than she designed that one man should
be independent of his fellow man. Her whole
economy points to a social state, where each
man and each body of men shall contribute
their quota to the comfort and advancement of
the great mass. There is no sectional legisla
tion by her. Under her laws all are regarded
as one great family; and that nation which dares
to oppose those laws,—to assert its own indepen
dence of those obligations so imposed, or to raise
its arm in war against others, must expect in a
harvest of curses its reward. Increase of refine
ment, and increase of wants consequent upon it,
will exert a strong influence to prevent war.
What once was a luxury, which could be dis
pensed with, now becomes an absolute necessity.
The silks of France, the spices of India, and
the teas of China, are now used by all classes,
and with them they would unwillingly dispense.
1 he products of many countries are required to
minister to the comfort of the individual. This
exerts a three-fold influence. It renders the con
sumer dependent upon the producer for a supply,
and the producer dependent upon the consumer
for a market: while this mutual intercourse, so
created, wears off the edge of those national pre
judices and antipathies, which are so active in
fomenting war.
The increased facilities for travelling, which
in some respects annihilate distance between
different countries, and bring them into immedi
ate contact, is also a great anti-war influence. So
rapid are conveyances, and so wonderful are
modern improvements, that a journey across the
Atlantic is scarcely more convenient, and re
quires scarcely more preparation, than did for
merly a journey of a hundred miles. In every
country are thousands of foreigners enjoying its
hospitalities, and admiring its institutions, who
act ns moving disseminators of peace doctrines.
These returned home with their minds enlighten
ed by travel; and with their mean and bigoted
views rooted out by extensive observation and
actual communication with the great spirits of
other nations, they are not less patriots while
they are more citizens of the world. Their
friends and acquaintances partake of their views,
and a new and liberal sentiment springs up in
the circle to which they belong. The remem
brance of pleasant scenes remains a love-inspir
ing influence. And if that individual ever acts
as politician, conscience will not permit him to
urge on an unnecessary war with the kind hosts
of Other days. The literary spirit of the age ia
opposed to war. By means of translations, the
literary treasures of one nation are opened to an
jther. The master mind of one nation speaks
o the inhabitants of a world. They become,
is it were, denizens of every land; and their
works are naturalized into every language.
Can an American read Faust, or Wollenstcin’s
Lager, or the Oberon, and at the same time be
hostile to the land of their authors? Can an
Englishman read the works of a Racine, of a
Rousseau, or of a De Stael, and at the same time
remember his old enmities against France?
The tremendous engines of destruction which
modern art has invented operate as a check to
ivar. It was an entirely different matter to fight
when men were clothed, in steel armour ; but
now whole ranks may be swept away by a single
instrument: numbers are no longer pledges of
victory; and the men shrink from a contest in
which the race is not to the swift, nor the battle
:o the strong.
The change which has been made in the di
rection of surplus activity has a tendency to di
minish the number of wars. When the battle
field was considered the sole road to glory, ac
:ive minds were constantly plotting the distur
bance of peace and schemes of conquest: for
:hem peace was a restraint; and during its con
inuance, their powers were rusting out in inglo
rious ease. But now science presents fields for
:he most active minds to move in. The great
battle of truth against ignorance and falsehood
requires all the energies of man: that battle is
scarcely commenced: ages will not finish it.
The immense powers, both physical and mental,
which have been expended in rendering the hu
man race miserable, are now directed to their
improvement; and he who, at a former day,
would have led armies, and been first amid the
Jin ot war, is now the deep student and sound
philosopher, whose labours unfold the secrets of
nature to an admiring world. Here and there,
it is true, on the outskirts of civilization, this mur
derous process of man-slaying is still going for
ward ; But yet the day seems to be not far distant
when a tribunal of nations shall be established,
:o determine all matters of controversy between
:ivilized states. As it is, we should rejoice that
:he day of heroism is past, and. that wreaths
dipped in human gore are no longer objects of
blind adoration. B.
AMERICAN METHODISM.
The following just tribute to the Methodist
Church is copied from a sermon preached before
the Wesleyan Methodist Conference, some twelve
months since, by the Rev. Jarms Dixon. Ex
president of the Conference. The sermon is on
11 The origin, economy, and present position of
Methodism,” and certainly is one of the most
powerful discourses we have ever met with.
We need say nothing of the extract we make,—
it will speak for itself In another part of the
sermon we find the following opinion expressed
by the Rev. Speaker. We commend it to all
who attempt to disrate the American Methodist
Episcopal Church as having departed from Mr.
Wesley’s standard. Mr. Dixon, speaking of
Mr. Wesley as adapting the details of his sys
tem to the civil condition and moral wants of the
people, introduces the fact of his ordinations for |
Scotland, and then brings forward in support of
his position the organization of the Methodist E.
Church, and affirms it as his opinion that it is
here, in the United Sates, that the only embodi
ment of Mr. Wesley’s view of a true Scriptural
Church organization can be found. The follow
ing are his words. “ When the United States
had effected their emancipation from the mother j
country, Mr. Wesley considered himself at liber
ty to act with perfect fredom in the new territory,
and, we may say, to develope his views and opin
ions fully; and, if we mistake not, it is to the i
American Methodist Episcopal Church that we
are to look for the real mind and sentiments of
this great man. Obstructions removed, he in
stantly seized the opportunity of appointing an
entire Church-system, on the principle of mo
derate Episcopacy. And if we may judge of j
the wisdom and piety of the design by its use
fulness and success, certainly we shall be pre
pared to consider it most providential. No
church in modern times has made any thing like
the progress which is seen in this branch of our
community. But-the question was introduced!
not so much to state the amount of success which |
followed the establishment of this scheme, as to i
point out the principle of adaptation observable
in its adoption. We see, in this case, that when j
it was discovered to be essential to the well be
ing and growth of a particular section of the
body, that a somewhat different form of discip
line and order should be established from that!
which existed at home, the thing was at once ef
fected.”
Wc will not lessen the force of these words by
any remarks of ours.
There are some other portions of the sermon
that we intend to extract for the benefit of our j
readers. At present we have only space for the
following:
“ It was in this body [the British Conference]
in 17G9, thatthe “ wants of our American breth
ren were considered, and the question asked,
“ Who is willing to go?”—Two of our preach
ers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pillmoor,
made the offer. They were sent, with fifty
pounds for the chapel, twenty pounds for their
own expenses.” This unaffected question, “Who
will go?” the answer from two brethren “Send
us,” and the sum of twenty pounds given for
the general purposes of their mission, led to the
organization ofachurch,which.ifnotsoalready,is
likely to become the greatest Protestant body in
the world. We speak advisedly in this. Taking
into account the present numbers and position of
the “Amerinan Methodist Episcopal Church,”
—the wide area of the United States,—the rapid
ly increasing population of the country,—the
adaptation of their system to meet the wants of a j
scattered and new population,—and, above all, I
the completeness of their church order, which ■
is evidently looked upon with affectionate and i
loyal veneration on the part of the people,—we
aro furnished with moral data for the conclusion,
that the American Methodist Church must, in
the ordinary course of things, become one of the
greatest, if not the very greatest, united Protes
tant body in the world.
It is true, that this church can only be consid
ered in its infancy; but the progress already
made, and the spirit by which it is animated,
unite to indicate the certainty and rapidity of its
growth. With thirty three annual Conferences;
nearly one million of church members,—a reli
gious influence extending to about five millions
cti the population—almost foot thousand ordain
ed ministers,—and upwards of seven thousand
local preachers,—besides twenty Colleges and
one University, for the promotion of education
on strictly Christian principles, in union with
the Church,—we say all these, in connexion
with the peculiar character of the country, pre
sent an aspect of promise which can leave no
doubt on the mind as to the future. These so
cieties extend through the whole Union; the
Continent itself is the base of this mighty moral
operation; the older and more populons cities
yield their portion of pious communicants; but
the remote wildernesses, cultivated by the labo
rious evangelists of the cross, are equally fruit
ful. These young communities are laying the
foundation of future events, whether religious or
otherwise, of great consequence. It is the seed
time of their existence ; and generations unborn,
to the latest periods, must reap the harvest. This
is the exact position of America at present. Her
widely extended,—almost illimitable territory
will be filled with living man ; her remaining
forests will yield to the aggressions of civiliza
tion, and present successive harvests to industri
ous husbandry; the noble and magnificent rivers
which sweep through her territories will bear
feet, it is easy to see that a country so vast, va
ried, rich in resources, and capable ofevery kind
of advancement, and occupied withal by the en
terprising children of our own country, must
advance to a greatness equal to any thing the
world ever saw. In this state of incipient be
ing, the first occupation of the soil, as religious
teachers, secure a great advantage. This is
possessed, not exclusively, yet very extensively,
by our American brethren. Led on by their
zeal and devotedness to God, they have followed
the scattered settlers to their distant abodes; and,
in the midst of privations, labors and difficulties,
such as might make the stoutest hearts quail,
they have carried the '•‘■glad tidings of great
joy’ to these destitute people, and at the same
time laid the foundations of that church which
we see rising in such beautiful proportions,
magnificence and grandeur. Thus blending
with the very elements of society in its young
and vigorous pulsations, Methodism will, at
Ieart in its forms, expand with the social body.
May its doctrines, its spirit, and its experimental
features equally grow!”—Richmond Christian
Advocate.

SCHISM AMONG THE JEWS.
For some time past the Jews have been in a
state of great excitement, in consequence of a
memorial being presented to the various metro
politan synagogues, from a dissenting body of
their community, praying lor a revision of their
liturgy, time of worship, &c.; and in conse
quence of the vestry of the Great Synagogue
accepting the memorial, and, after deliberating
thereon, deciding upon leaving it to the decision
of their future chief rabbi, a committee formed
of members of various congregations,determined
to preserve inviolate the ancient rites and cere
monies of the Jews, called a public meeting,
which was held at Howard’s Assembly Rooms,
St. Jame’s-place, and was most numerously and
respectably attended.
The Chairman expressed his deep regret at
such a demonstration of the religious feeling of
his brethren, and was gratified in seeing the pub
lic response to the untoward memorial; it had
been got up by a party who had actually seceded
from them, and notwithstanding the opposition
they had met with, they were determined to
stand by their ancient laws. The meeting was
addressed by several gentleman, who felt them
selves imperatively called upon to use their best
exertions to stem the torrent of innovation, and it
was unanimously agreed that a counter-memori
al be presented to the Great Synagogue expres
sive of their sentiments, of which the following
is a copy:—
“Resolved, Thai your memorialists have heard
with the deepest regret that a memorial (having
for its object a revision and curtailment of oursvn
agogue service, &.C., purporting to contain the
sentiments of the majority), has been received
by your board by a casting vote of your presi
dent, in addition to individual votes, and that the
vestry has resolved to call the attention of the
Chief Rabbi to the prayers of the petitioners at
a very early period after he shall have been
appointed. Your memorialists cannot but deeply
lament that such a course has been adopted, as it
must evidently prove injurious to our ancient
and venerable institutions; lor from time imme
morial our laws, customs, ceremonies, and rites,
have stood the test of ages, without the slightest
alteration; and should any modification now be
introduced, it will occasion those who are anx
ious to cause dissention among our brethren, and
to seduce us from the faith of our forefathers, to
say that the Hebrews ‘are at last dividing them
selves, and wish to remove some of their ancient
customs,’ which will at once destroy our nation
ality, which we have sustained unsullied for thou
sands of years....Your memorialists, with all
due deference to the supporters of the contem
plated alterations, solemnly declare their full de
termination to uphold, support, and maintain, in
the fullest integrity, all the ancient laws, customs,
ceremonies, rites and forms of service of their
forefathers. Your memorialists trust that any
thing herein stated will not be considered disre
spectful to the vestry, for such your memorialists

PUSEYISM AT ETON COLLEGE.
It has been whispered for some time past that
several of the authorities of this ancient scat of
learning have become converts to the now ‘‘fash
ionable," but not the less dangerous, Puseyite
doctrines, which are making such deep inroads
among the clergy of our Protestant Church. It
is feared, indeed, that the rumour is but too true;
and there is very little doubt entertained, in nu
merous high and influential quartirs, that unless
some satisfactory proofs are afforded to dissipate
the alarm which has thus been very naturally
created amongst the Protestant parents of the|
seven hundred pupils at that institution, the most
rarioua results, with reference to the future well
being and prosperity of the college, must neces
sarily ensue. That one of the most influential
of the masters, the Rev. Edward Coleridge, M.
A., of Exeter College, Oxford, and the brother
if Mr.Justice Coleridge, is a Tractarian advocate
ind an espouser of the doctrines of Puseyism, is
low beyond question or doubt. The Rev. Mr.
Coleridge was amongst the first to affix his sig
lature to the remonstrance, addressed by some
200 or 300 of the non-resident members of con
vocation of the University of Oxford, to the Rev.
:he Vice-Chancellor for having “suspended” the
Rev. Dr. Pusey for his heretical and anti-Pro
:estant sermon. The effect of the Senior Assist
ant Master of Eton having thus publicly avowed
himself a professor of the Romish-Puseyite faith,
will, it is feared, tend very considerably to injure
the hitherto high Protestant reputation of the
venerable College of Eton.—London Herald.

RECOLLECTIONS OP SUMMERFIELD.
FIRST VISIT TO TRENTON, N. J.
“ How beautiful appear on the mountains
The feet of the joyful messenger; of him that announc
ed peace!
Of the joyful messenger of good tidings; of him that an
nounced salvation!
Of him that sayeth unto Zion, Thy God reigned!”
Isaiah 52: 7. Lowth’s Translation.
The writer oi this article bad the pleasure of
accompanying Mr, Summerfield on one of his
“ angel visits” to a neighbouring city. He was
at this time stationed in the city of New York.
It was the first year of his ministry in this coun
try. The fame of his unrivalled eloquence had
already gone far and wide abroad, and numerous
invitations for his services were flowing in from
every quarter. Among the rest, he was invited
to visit Philadelphia and Trenton. Having ac
cepted the invitation he made his arrangements,
and sometime, early I think in August of 182
he set out for these places, purposing to stop at
Trenton on the way. The plan was to take the
steam-boat on Friday for Brunswick; and
thence on Saturday proceed to Trenton, where
he was to spend the Sabbath.
A few friends, beside the writer, were to ac
company him to Brunswick. Among these
were Mr. and Mrs C. About noon our little
party were on board,—the bell was rung,—the
fastenings unloosed, and we on our way. Though
far from well, Mr. S. exerted himself to enter
tain the group of attached friends that was con
stantly around him. His conversation was as
usual varied and fascinating ; though at this dis
tance of time, the writer of this well ncollects
that it seemed to him there was not that sparkling
vivacity of fancy, and general animation, which
usually marked all his social intercourse. He
was in fact, through the w hole of this journey,
labouring under the insidious approaches of that
disease which in a few days laid him on a sick
bed, bringing him near to the gates of death.
The boat reached Brunswick towards evening.
Brother P.,the present Corresponding Secretary
of the Missionary Society, then stationed in
that city, was waiting on the wharf. He greet
ed Mr. S. most affectionately, and soon found a
pleasant home for himself and all his party.
Mr. S. retired early, being much fatigued w ith
his exertions during the day. The writer occu
pied the same apartment with him. It w as a soft,
mellow-moonlight night; all was still and beau
tiful ; and as Mr. S. slept, the writer sat at the
window, listening to the breathing of the dear
sleeper, now and then casting a glance at him,
and then looking out upon the clear blue heave ns,
with the moon sailing through the vast and
cloudless space, and adoring the Being whose
hand was impressed upon all he saw. After a
while he too lay down carefully, fearing to
disturb the rest Mr S. so much needed.
Saturday morning before the stage set out for
Trenton, Mr. S. found time to visit several fam
ilies. He prayed in every family where he
went. This was his rule. He little esteemed a
visit ifitdid nottendto promote personal piety. In
all such visits invariably was his conversation
“ season'd with salt, fit to minister grace to the
hearer.” At length the stage was at the door ;
and having previously parted with his friends
Mr. and Mrs. C. ana others, (who returned to
New York,) there was now none but the w riter
to accompany him. Mr. S. sat on the middle
seat. Opposite him on the front seat sat a gen
tleman of very respectable appearance; some
what advanced in life,—perhaps brtween fifty
and sixty. Mr. S. said but little. His face was
exceedingly pale; he seemed quite languid. The
excitement of society the day before had lid him
to task his efforts more than the present state of
his health would bear, and he now appeared de
| sirous of sinking into silence. The heat grew
j more oppressive and sultry as the day advanced;
the roads were heavy with sand; and we pro
ceeded at a slow rate. At length the gentleman,
i opposite Mr. S., not exactly liking his seat, feel
I ing himself a little incommoded, and supposing
(as he afterward apologized) that he was address
ing a Princeton student, asked Mr. S., rather as
if he had a right to expect it, (at all events the
manner of doing it was especially grating in
the writer’s ear.) to change seats with him. A
slight flush tinged the cheek of Mr. S. He look
ea ai nim ior a moment n un surprize ; min wun
out a word assented to the proposal. He w as
now at the writer’s side; and thus we rode till
we reached Trenton, about dark. Here a Meth
odist brother received Mr. S., and conducted him
to his house. As soon as he could do so, he
begged to be shewn to his room. Greatly fatigued,
evidently much depressed in his spirits, without
tasting any food, he retired for the night. After
two or three hours, the writer also retiring, found
hint still awake and restless. He had forgotten,
such scrupulous regard had he to little things,
one of his customary Saturday duties, and its in
trusion upon the Sabbath had given him no small
anxiety. He passed a restless night. The
heat was great,—the room small; the air close
and confined. He rose early on the Sabbath ;
spent the entire morning in his room,—ate no
thing,—scarcely spoke a word. In truth in ad
dition to the state of his health, his first tflbrt in
a strange place, the expectations which he knew
were excited, but especially the greatness of the
work, and the overwhelming solicitude which on
all occasions he felt for the success of his minis
try, completely absorbed all his thoughts. At
no time did he appear in the pulpit, except from
the privacy of the closet. His unutterable
breathings were first poured forth into the ear of
the Father of Spirits; and if a halo of celestial
glory encircled him in the pulpit, it was from
thence the emanation came.
The Methodist church in Trenton was small;
the pulpit Awkwardly constructed,—the appear
