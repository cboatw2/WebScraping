else. But what tax would amount to a
prohibition? Would five hundred, or five
thousad dollars reach that point? Or i.
tint the trade already taxed to prohibition?
Must the tax prohibit the whole or only a
part of the community, before ithecones
uinconstitutional? Is it constitutional to
impose a tax that Will act as a prohibition
upon the poor man, and allow the rich to
inonopoli:e all the profits of the trade by
getting rid of competition? And is not
this the operation of the present law?
The license is raied to such sat amount
that none but the rich can aford to pay
it. and the poor man is deprived of his equal
trighit and privileges. I r ill upon the Le
gislature to pass a law that will iperate
equally upon all classes of nmen. And if
we must have dram shops in the country,
let the poor have the benefit of the trade,
as well as the -rick. Or if you prohibit
the poor. as you have already done, prohib
it the rich also. And let us have even

Mr. Editor:
I would not have believed that the ar
tiele, which appeared in your last paper,
signed "Cato," could deceive any one,
who had been sufficiently educated to
read it, had yot not mentioned the fact
that it was published "by request." For
the benefit, then, of those who are as ig
norant oi the suldect, as "Cato," is him
self, I will currente calamo comnment upon
his argument.
Having assumed that all who are op
posed to the present license Lauw, fire "in
fatuated by lblind zeal," he comnnnicates
to the Leeislature. the itmportant inte!li
gence. that we area bout to "sweep away
with one fell blow," what he is pleased
poetically to terni, " the radical element
of liberty in these States,"-namely, the
Dram Shops!
But let tus examine his argtment.
What is the object of his article? If he
had any object, it must have been to inves
tigate what was the political power of S.
Carolinq. To ascertain this, with certain.
tv. he commetices by etiluiring into the
powers of Congress. And recollecting
that the "American System," was pro
nounnced unconstitutional by Sotah Caro
lina, he comes to the following conclusion
Congress has not the right io protect North
ern Vlanufictories, at the extense of South
e'n interests and therefore, the reonle of
South Carolina have not the right to
brake tip "grog shops." His conclusion
is irresistable!
The next position which he assumes is.
"that no State in the Union can possess
such a right ; because the exclusire regula
tiont of commerce is loded in Congress."
And he thinks that -any senrible man msi
see this." Will -Caut" lie kind enotigh
to point me out the claue of the Constit-i.
tint, which erants to Congress the --ex
clusive " fight to rezulate commerce? It
is well to be accurate when arauing a
question which so deeply. directly. and
1antigerously effects not otly the liberties of
the people of South Carolina, but even
the very existence of our State Govern
inent.- For if we have not the right, as
Cato " says, of taxine the property
of our citizens.-I would be aid to he
iafortmed howv we are to pay the exnaences
of onr State Governwvent? If we can
raise tbo revenue, howv can otir Gohvern
ttetnt exist? Is "Cato" aware itat the
onastrutctiont of this very clause of the
Constitution was thte origin of that hitter,
thtough blootdless udisputte which -amue so
ntear levering otur Utnon in 1832! Bait
even ite ndvocates of the Tariff' and the
Federal Court have never claimed that
Congtress htad the right to regtulate comn
mier~e .in ng 'lie citi::enh of the same blu.te.
No one xc.ept "Citto." has ever denied
that t.' States have thme right to regn
late :te traf11e. bet'oeent their own cili::ens.
How else cotid we tsx the cap)ital of our
MI r, tnnts, or even trades and profe'ssiotts.

I have thoutgh the 3rdl el-sue itf the 8th
section of the 1st Aticle, doaes give to
Congress the powver "Tat reenlute cona

Doaes "Cat"'," know thtat it was movedl,

proposition wats rejected, the votes bieing~
takent by States! (See 220, and 270.
".Jturnal of Cotavention.") I hope, ont
"Cato's" own account, thatt, wvhen he mtade;
the assertson, he was ignorant of the fact
that the States had, so far from granting,
positively refused. to Congress the "errlu
sive" right to regailate Commuterce; for:
thouigh the exptosure of his ignorance anid
arrogatnce must be wvoundling to "Cato's"
vanity, it will be somne consolation to him,a
th know that at least ho is an honest malt.
If it is Ignorance (as we are bound in
cnarity to- helieve) anal tnt viciousness,
which has catisei "Catat," to commtit the
errors which he haaa. K may, lay giving
him sitme information on thie subject, save
him the maortifica;tion of againi seeing his
igotrance extposedl to the papers. By re
-ferring. to the case of Gibabons vs Ogden
(9. Wheat. R. 1, 199 to 202) he will see
that the Supreme Court of the U. States,
has detertinte.i that the States have not
granted to Congress any controtl "ov r the
comunerce" which is completely internal,
-"which is carriedl on betwea'n man and
man in a state, or ht weena different parts
of the same Etate." But thait "the comn
ptletely internat commerce of a State may
be cotnstdered as~ reserzed for the State
itself." By refertrmn3to the case "Cat')"
will also see that I hhe quoted the t-ery
words usPed by Mr. Chaelustice Marshall,

loving Cato, of toy devotion to that sacred
instrument. "Cato" admrits that "over
things imported a State may ins'itute reg
ulation." What "Cato" miteans by the
elegant phrase "institute regulation" I am
unable to comprehend; since it is one not
to be found in the law books, or in the Con
stitution. But this "regulation" lie tells
us is not to proceed to "prohibition."
Has the intelligence ever reached -Ein
met Lodee" that the people of South Car
olina in 1835 by an Act or Assembly. im
posed a tax nf one thousand dollars on
hlawkers and Pedlars? Does breaking up
a trade amount to "prohibition?" If so
we have by express Law "llrohiaited"
Pedlars from "selling or exposing to sale
any goods wares or merchandize" whether
"imported" or not. Ani our Courts have
never qniestioned the constitutionality of
this Law. I will not quarrel with "Cato"
about terms; hut shall simply proceed to
show the incidents appertaminn to the
"instituted regulation" of which lie speaks.
First, then the People of South Carolina
have a right to regulate the place and
manner in which one shall dispose of his
Merchandize. This is illustrated by the
case of the Pedlar already cited. That
they have a right to define the quantity
is liklewise manifest front an existing, law
in relation to retailers themselves; "Cato"
mey possibly know from experience, that
a retailer cannot recover for a less quantity
of likor titan a quart. That we have
a right to prescribe the person is equally
clear it being a penal off'ence in this
State for any one to trale with a slave.
Upon the constitutionality of these laws
our Courts have already decided.
But "Cato" still insists -that there is no
constitutional right in prohibit the sale
of anv article of commerce in which there
is capital nui labor." Ift lie sapient "Cato"
will turn to the 23d pane of the Acts of
Assembly of 1S20 lie will fild that South
Carolina" has -,prohibited" the introduction
or circulation of any hooks or pamliets"
calcnlated "to disturb the peace or securi
ty" of her citizens. I would like to lie in
.irnied by one so learned in tne Law as
"Cato" surely is, since he has undertaken
to instruct our Legislators. w hether books
and pamphldets are -'articles of commerce in
which there is capital and labor?"
But I have wasted too much time al
ready, upon the rodomantade of this va
poring scribbler. Nothing, as I before said,
but the considernion. that some, even more
ignorant than -Cato," himself, might be
iifluenced by his unmeaning jargon about
liberty and laws, would ever have induced
me to notice so silly a production. Whilst
we are discussing lie propriety of alter
ing or repealing a law already upon our
statute hook, "Cato" is rating about
constitutions & commerce. I believe that
we, the citi:ens of S. Carolina are freemen.
I helieve.("Cato's" opinion to the contra
ry, notwit list anding.) that we noto possess
the righi of making such laws as wce seefit,
for our own government, and that when we
lose this right we will cease to befreemen!
If, then. the people of S. Carolina choose
to alter, or repeal the present license laws,
or any other law upon their statute book,
I can not perceive that they are doing
more than, as freemen, they have a right to
to do. EDGEFIELD.

county, who resides about four miles fron
the Sanday Ford in Jefferson county,
while going to superinted his negroes at
work, was attacked by a paty of Indians
supposed to lie about a dozen, who fired
upon him. Mr. Lee was shot through the
body. but we are gratified to leran, will
recover. lie was armed nt the time of
the attack, mnd gillantly returned ithe fire,
and although hadly hmrt, was enal.ded io
get on his horse and ride for aid. His
negroes fled home immediately, except
one valtiable slave, that is yet missing.
Criev were henril as the oiers retre.ited,
which indtces the belie that the slave was
probably overtaken by the Indians and
shot. Several citizens rallied as soon as
possible, and atarted in search of the In
dianus. They found the gin house of Mr.
Andrew J. Lee had been set on fire and
about fort y hales ofcotton destroyed The
Indians were ii the act of attacking the
