r~ dir I. the cr~uted silence of
the Candidates ol Edgefield Ditriet; for
the Senate and iouse of repiesentatives,
it appears that they are determined not to
ket their sentiments be knoon, .as it regards
'the interrogatories propounded in your pa
per, and also thosencopieti from the Ham
burg Journal.
I would therefore. suggest the propriety
of holdingameeing on next Sale-day, it
the interrogatories are not answered before,
to foi-m such interrogatories as may be
thought proper, and then call upon each
individual Candidate in alphabetical order.
to give his views in as brief a manner as
possible upon each interrogatory. Let the
same. be published, and at least one cupy
be put up at each box in the iOisirici, that
every voter may decide before giving his
suffrage, wbtd is most worthy ofhis support
I entirely coincide in the views of Voter,
.in your last, and hope that each voter at
the election will write Division, or no Di.
vision, on the back of his ticket for mem.
berg, and that the Candidates give their
pledge, to be for or against the division of
the District, as a majority of the people
. may decide.

Mir' Editor-A mnost melancholy ocentrence.
tradlspired in this place, on thle evening of tiW
6th Inst.. We allude to an affray between two
of the student, -Sainuel Miller and Peter K.
Thoupson, which iestilted in tihe death of the
latter. To prevent misconception. and correct
ekaggerated reports, w e send yon a statement
ofthe principal Ihets in the case.
The fatal aiTair ocettred in the hall of the
Philomathean Society. The arternoon of Fri
day is always devota!. by the literary societies
Oftis Institution, to the peculiar exercises up.
propriate to them. At the meeting on last Fri.
day. Mr- .Miller. it seems, took offence at- the
conduct-of Mr. Thompson. during the delib
erations ofthe evening. Immediately alter the
adjourment of tih society some angry words
were passed, which resulted in a contest, and
the eveit was. the death -if Mlr. Thompson. It
was found to have been occasioned by two stahls
inficted, one on the left side, near time region
of the heart, anmd the other abomut time abdomen.
Ar. Thompson expired it. filheen or twenty
minutes afler a separation was 4ifected. Th
wounds were inflicted with a pocket knife,
with a blade about three and a half inches in
length. - The whole affair occupied a period.
not, perhaps exceed ing half a minute. There
was no passionate excitement amongst any oth
er individuals: nor were there any other per
sons engaged in the fray, but those mentioned
above.
Mr. Miller has been taken into cistody, and
the matter is under process off judicial investi
gation. which forbids that any thing should be
said which might be prejudicial to either of the
parties. We hope. therefore, that the public
will simpend theit opinion respecting the whole
trauisaction till all the evidence is brought for
ward in open Court.
