COUSINS.
Had you ever a Cousin, Tom?
Did your Cousin liajipon to sing?
Sisters, we'vo all by the dozen Tom,
But a Cousin's different thing;
And you'd find, if ever you had kiss'd hor, Tom,
(But lot this be a secret between us)
That your lips would havo been in a blister, Tom,
For they're not of tlio sister genus.
There is somotliing, Tom, in a sister's lip,
When you give lior a good night kiss,
That savors so much of relationship,
That nothing occurs amiss:
But a Cousin's lip, if you onco unite
With your's in the quietest way,
Instead of sleeping a wink that night,
You'll be dreaming the following day.
And people think it no harm Tom,
With a Cousin to hoar you talk;
And 110 0110 feels any alarm, Tom,
At a quiet cousinly walk;
But, Tom, you'll soon find what I happen to
know,
Such walks often grow into straying,
A .,J ?i.? i??.

Heaven only knows what they'll be saying!
And then thoro happen so often, Tom,
Soft pressure of hands and fingers,
And looks that were mould to soften, Tom,
And looks on which memory lingers;
And long ere your walk is half over, tho strings
Of your heart arc put all into play,
By the sound of those demi-sialcrly things,
In not quite tho most brotherly way.
A: id tho voice of a sistormny bring to you Tom,
Such tales as the angols woo,
But I fear if your Cousin should sing to you Tom,
You'd take her for an angel too;
For so curious a note is that note of thoir's,

Hap boon all the while singing National Airs,
Instead of the Psalms of David.
I oneo had a Cousin that sung, Tom,
And hor name may bo nameless now,
Put the sound of those songs is still young Tom,
Though we no longer are so.
'Tis folly to droain of a bower of green,
"When thoro is not a loaf on tho treo;
Put 'twixt walking and singing that Cousin has
been,
God forgive her! the ruin of me.

On the first page of to-day's paper we publish
a communication relative to the election
of our next Gov. We consider is too soon
to agitate the subject, but as it has been
discussed by every paper in the State, there
may be no impropriety in giving the views
of our correspondent a place in the Mountaineer.
As the election of Governor is made
by the Legislature in this State, it generally
excites but little interest with the people.
There are three gentlemen spoken of for
that office, viz. Col. Richardson, Judge
David Johnson and Col. Hammond.?
Wc have very little duobt but Col. R.
will be the one selected for the office,
notwithstanding the opposition of a fewviolent
partizans. He belonged to the
Union pary throughout the Nullification
contest, and will probably be opposed by
some of the members of the then dominant
party. He is said to be in favour of the
present Administration and the Sub-Trcaj
ury, and will therefore meet with o'ppo1
sition from the friends of Mr. Clay and the j
Banks, who were attached to both the old J
j parties. Col. Richardson is a gentleman j
! of fine talents, and has filled the various
posts to which he has been called, with
honor to himelf and satisfaction to his
constituents. We know of no man in the |
State who is better qualified to fill the Gubernatorial
chair, and we shall be highly
gratified if he is selected for that station.
The nomination was first made by the
former opponents of Col. R., and was inintended
as a kind of salvo for healing the
divisions which recently prevailed in this;
state and more firmly cementing the union
i that now exists. Under these considerations

EARTHQUAKE IN BURMAII.
The following account of the earthquake
in Burmah in March last, is from the pen
of the Rev. Eugene Kincaid, a Baptist
Missionary who has resided several years
in that country. It is from a letter addressed
to Dr. Paine, N. Y.
On the 23d of March, between three |
j and four in the morning, Ava was visited
with one of the most terrible earthquakes 1
ever known in this part of the world. A*
,loud rumbling noise, hkc me roar or
! distant thunder, was heard, and in an ini
stantj the earth began to reel from cast to
: west with motions so rapid and voilcnt,1
that jicople were thrown outtflptheir beds,1
and obliged to support themselves by laying
holdof posts. Boxes and furniture were
thrown from side to side with violence,
similar to what takes place on board a ship
in a severe storm at sea. The waters
some times with great impetuosity, strewing
the shores with the wrecks of boats
and buildings. The plains between Umcrapora
and the river were rent into vast
yawning caverns, running from north to
south, and from ten to twenty feet in
width. Vast quantities of water and black
sand were thrown upon the surface emitting
at the same time a strong sulphurous
smell. As you will suppose, the three
cities of Ava, Umcrapora, and Sagaining,
are vast piles of ruins, burying
in their fall great numbers of people
jwho were asleep at the awful moment.
The destruction ol me, However, is not so
great as it might havebeen expected from
the entire overthrown of three large and
populous cities. The reason Is, the great
mass of the people live in wood and
bamboo houses. Had the houses in these
cities been built of bricks and stones, as
houses in America the population must,
have perished. Ever}' thing built of brick
?houses, monasl cries, temples, & the citywalls
are all crumbled down. Of all immense
numbers of pagodas in Ava, Umerapora,
and Sagaing, and on the Sagaing
hills opposite to Ava, not one is standing.
The labor and wealth of ages, the pride j
and glory of Boodhism, has been laid low
in the dust, in one awful moment.
To me this is a deeply afflicting
thought; in great numbers of those proud
temples of idolatry, I have preached the
gospel; and while hundreds were bowing
down before huge idols have proclaimed
jtho power, the majesty, and glory of that
I Almighty Being who sits enthroned in ;
j the highest heavens; that the day was at
hand when God would vindicate the honor
of his name; and that all these proud monuments
of heathenism would fall into
hopeless ruin, and be forgotten by succeeding
generations. Some were convinced,
some had their confidence in idols shaken,
but the great multitude were quite
indifferent. Some few would zealously
defend their roligion. Little did I think
that the hour of God,s vengenance was
at the door, and that so soon these enormous
idols and lofty temples the labour of
thirty generations, were to become a
mass of frightful ruins.
Letters from Ava up to the 11 th of
April, inform us that the rumbling noise,
noise, like distant thunder, had not yet
ceased; and shocks often considerably
violent were felt day and night with gel
dom as much as one hours intermission
The extent of the great shock, or rathe:
succession of great shocks, on the morning
of the 2.3d of march is not yet fully ascertained.
It was so severely felt at Mauimain,
that many sprang out of bed, supposing
a gang of theives had broken into
the house; yet it was not violent enough
to do any damage. As far as is now as
.1 CJ I. n n.l
asuci tauicu, i IUJUC IU uiu c*>mui, anu
Bomcc to the north of Ava, were entirely
overthrown by the earthquake, so that from
Prome to China, more than six hundred
miles north and south, embracing the
most populous part of the empire, not a
single pagoda, temple, or a brick building,
is left standing. The eartquake was
severe in Arrocan, an old volcano, on the 1
island of Bromee, was re-opened, and
the long concealed fires, mingled with
smoke and ashes, rose to a fearfiil height.
It remains to be ascertained yet, how far
this great earthquake extended into China,
but as there are several volcanoes a- ,
mong the mountains between Burmah and
China, it is more than probable to me
that there are subterranean communications
between the volcanoes of the north,
and the vlcanoes of the south, as among the
mountains between Arracan and Burrnah,
<fc in the Island of Bromee, and also on the
Andeman island in the Martiban gulf.
The two extremes are moic than
one thousand miles apart, in a direct line
north and south. But the fact that the
whole intermediate country was shaken
at the same moment, a prodigious subterranean
noise was heard, resembling
the rolling of thunder, I think, satisfactory
evidence that there are subterranean communications
between these widely separated
volcanoes. How else can we ac-:,
count for so terrible an earthquake over
so vast an extent of country ? The coincidence
of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
is not remarkable, but that several
hundred miles of territory, with all
its mountains and rivers; should be thrust
up and thrown into undulating motion at
the same moment of time, accompanied
by sounds from the centre of the earth,
like the rolling of thunder, are phenomena
which cannot be accounted for on
any other supposition than that of vast
subtcrranoan lines of communication be-;
tween volcanic mountains.

SPEECH OF MR. CALilOUN,
OF SOl'TIX CAIUUIS.V.
In Snide, WcJucnky, February 5, 18 40
?On Mr. OnuMJi B report irj relation
to the assumption oj' the debts of tho
of the Sta^s by the Federal. Governmcnt.
CONCLUDED.
IIow much wiser for all would be the
opposite system of low duties, with tho
market of the world opened to our great
agricultural staples? The effects would
be a vast increase of cur exports, with a
corresponding increase of the capacity to
consume on the part of the South and
West, making them rich and contented
customers, instead of impoverished and
discontented rivals of the other section. It
is time that this subject should be regarded
in its trne light. The protective system
is neither more nor less than a war on
the exports. I again repeat, if we cannot
import, we cannot long export; and
just as we cut oft' or burden the imports,
to the same extent do we, in effect, cut off
and burden the exports. This I have long
seen, and shall now proceed to prove, by
reference to the public documents, that my
assertion is sustained by facts. The table
of exports shows that during the seven
years from 1824 to 1831, our domestic ex- *
ports remained nearly stationary, notwithstanding
the great increase of our population
during that period. Your statute
booh wiil show that during the same period,
the protective system was in its greatest
vigor. The first relaxation took place
in December, 1830, under the act of tho
2Gth May, of the same year, which made
a great deduction in the duties on coffee
and tea. I shall now turn to the table and
give the exports of domestic articles for
those years, beginning with 1824.
Here Mr. C. read the following statement:
In 1624 the domestic oxnortB wcro $50,549,500
1825 " " " 66,944,745
1826 " ? ? 53,055.710
1827 " " " 53,921,G91
1828 " " ? 66,669,669
1829 " " ? 55,700,133
1830 " " " 59,452,029
If we take the average of the three first and
the three last of these years, we shall find
the former three million and a half greater
than the latter, showing an actual falling
off, instead of an increase to that extent
in our exports.
With 1831, the reduction of duties commenced
on the articles mentioned: and in
December, 1833, the first great reduction
took place under the compromise act. I
shall turn to the same table beginning with
1831, and read a statement of the exports
for eight years under the approach to the
free trade system. It is but an approach.
I invite especial attention to tne rapia rise,
after the great reduction in December,
1833.
Li 1831 the domestic exports woro $61,227,052
1832 ? ? ' 63,137,470
1833 ?' ' " 70,317,170
1834 " " " 81,831,162
1835 ? * ? 101,133,082
1836 " '? " 106,916,680
1837 " " " 93,56!,-114
1833 ' " " 96.033.821
How rapid the rise just as the weights
are removed! The increase since the great
reduction in 1833, has nearly doubled the
average exports, compared with the average
of the seven tariff years preceding
1831, and would have quite doubled them
had not the expanded and deranged condition
of the currency and the consequent
embarrassment of commerce prevented it.
But what will appear stil! more extraor?
dinary to those who have not reflected on
the operation of the protective system, is
the great increase of the exports of our
domestic manufactures, as the duties go
r>fT, following, in that respect, the same
law* that regulates the exports of the great
agricultural staples. It is a precious fact,
that speaks volumes, and w hich demands
the serious consideration of the manufacturing
portion of the Union. I well remcm
bcr the sanguine expectations of the friends
of the system of the great increase of tha
exports of domestic manufactures which
they believed would follow the tariff of
1S28. Well, now we have the result of
experience, under that act, and also, under
I hat of a partial return to free trade, and
the result is exactly the reverse of the anticipations
of the friends and advocates of
protection. So far from increasing under
the tariff of I32S, the exports of manufactured
articled actually dhvuni: i:vd. vri 'In
they have rapidly increased just as they
have gone oh".
But the talilc nf exports will speak for
itself. During the four years, under tho
tariiF of '2t, that is, from that year till 'Si),
when the tariff of ''2ft went into operation,
the exports of domestic manufactures gradually
declined from 8">,7:29.797. in the
year *27. to 8f>..">iS,3"?4 in the year '2ft.?
From that time it steadily declined under
the tariff of '28, each succeeding year
showing a falling off compared with the
preceding, till '33, declining throughout the
