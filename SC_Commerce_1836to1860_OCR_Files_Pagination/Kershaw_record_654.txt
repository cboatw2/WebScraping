* CLAY AND THE TARIFF"
A correspondence lias just taken place between
the Whig members of the New York Legislature
and Ex-Senator Clay, to a few passages
of which we would call public attention in the
South. There is no longer any doubt that , a
Protective Tariff is the great end and aim'df the
* Whig?party, and that Mr. Clay, their leader, has
v_ui?-uriMirlo'? thot nimfir.nl ffa/v.
. POJUJV once , ._
' The Committee ift their letter to Mf. Clay say:
"It is not within the coihpnss of ouEjiclcsign to
dwell upon^the numerous monuments of your
wisdom ancryour patriotism?they live in "the
History of the Republic. But there is one great
measure which more than any other, has oc'cu-.
pied your care, and to which wc may he permitted
particularly to allude, as demanding in an
especial manner the thanks of yon r fellow-citi^
zens?we mean THE PROTECTION OF
HOME INDUSTRV.
"This vital policy was adopted by you at the
commencement of your political life in the Legislative
halls of Kentucky. If was the subject
of your first effort, and constituted your first triumph
on entering the Senate of the United States
in 1809; you re-established it after the return of
peace in 1810, and was its successful defender
?, in the great debates in 1820, 1824 and 18:12."
To this Mr. C. gratefully replies:
"It was a view of this condition of the world,
and instructed by lessons' of experience drawn
from its history, and the practice of other nations,
that early led me to a conclusion in favor of the
Protection of the Domestic Industry of our own
Country. Free trade is a beautiful vision, existing
only in the imagination of philosophers
? and theorists, and practically repuuiaiea uy an
nations. An indispensable condition to t lie adoption
of it, by any one nation, is its adoption by
all.- But instead of regulating their trade, acr
cording to that theory, we every where behold
restrictions, burdens, and prohibitions. And
those nations which make the nearest approximation
to it are in the least prosperous state. If
there were any reality in the boastful promises
of the partizan of free trade, our country ought,
at this moment, to be in the enjoyment of an enviable
prosperity. But directly the reverse is
its melancholly condition. Never were the products
of Agriculture selling at more discouraging
prices; and the great Southern staple of
cotton, is now sold at a price less than it has
commanded at any time since the last war with
Great Britain.
"Agriculture requires but little protection,
because its position secures it against much foreign
competition; or, rather, protection to Commerce
and Manufactures is the best form of affording
protection to Agriculture.
"Fortunately for the harmony of the different
parts of the Union,'and without the danger of reviving
old topics which formerly agitated and
exasperated parties, the actual wants of the
Treasury now require a Tariff which, while it
supplies a necessary Revenue, may be so arranged
as to afford incidental protection to Manufactures
without any material departure from the
principles of the compromise act. The opponents
of the protective policy have never controverted
the right of Government to give such
incidental protection; and the friends of that policy,
looking to the substance nther than the
name of things, I should think, ought to be content
if their object is attained, whcthcrii be made
in the form of a Revenue Tariff or a Protective
Tariff."
? 1 ' ' 'li'ignls? gBVll;lU piunpunj IIL lUnnni.'lvd a "fro?
tectixe tariff;"?"Agriculture needs but little protection.'"
and "fortunately, the actual wants of the
Treasury now require a Tariff"! You sec here
fellow?ctt.izens, the reason why Mr. Clay was
so keen to give away the proceeds of the public
lands to the States?it was to so impoverish the
?ublic Treasury, that its wants would demand a
'rotective Tariff, and thus afford him a hobby
on which he might ride into the l'uesidential
chair. Mind, he is writing to the northern Tariffites,
and rejoices at the bankrupt state of the
national Treasury, and says it is "fortunate"
for we now have an excuse for laying a protective
tari?r?we can now tax the Soutli for your
benefit, and say its to furnish revenue! This is

Of all the administrations with which this nation
has been blessed or injured, John Tyler's is
incomparably the most weak and viciotis. The
master spirit is Webster, and yet at times the
weak President, has broke like a stubborn and
petulent boy from his guardian. I lis Virginia
associates, and some appeals to his former conduct,
induced him to veto the Bank bill. Perhaps
a growing jealousy of Clay, who dictated
like a Nero the measures of the Extra Session,
had an influence. Whatever was the cause, we
were glad of the act, though the bill, had it passed,
would have proved an utter failure, for the
stock could not have been taken up.
With coarse indecency, he has, without cause,
assailed the late .Democratic administration on
repeated occasions, lie hastened to sign that
corrupt act, the Distribution bill, which he has
since besought Congress to repeal. The nation,
under his administration, has been precipitated
into debt beyond all precedent and example, although
promising great retrenchment and reform.
I $,
His appointments have been more corrupt and
vicious than those of any other President excepting
Harrison ; both-?verc in violation of.their
solemn promises, as well as in utter disregard of
common honesty and of public faith. Both were
undoubtedly imposed upon by bad advisers. Too
feeble in intellect themselves to discriminate,
each became the instrument of bad men, and the
Mitchells and Doteys, and Trumbulls, and other
unprincipled demagogues controlled to a great
extent, appointments.
We 6ee it Btated that Tyler intends to reform
6ome of his Connecticut appointments. Well
would it be for the country were he to do so, for
the appointments in tins State have been notoriously
bad as well as unjust. But it would be
wqll for this weak Executive to consider what
he is about, for we hear that his proposed appointments
are all of a downward lending, calculated
to make bad worse. .
Jyler also signed the odious Bankrupt bill,
and was guilty of the Indecency of urging its
passage through Congress by a special message.
A clear-headed, 6ingle-hcarted, honest man,

nature to such an act. But it was concocted .-by
Daniel Webster, whose note for twelve thousand
dollars was, with others, recently sold at the rate
of about one cent on the dollar.
In short, weakness and;yanity arc thepr^dnminant
characteristics of Mr. Ty lor. Yy'ithoUUiny
distinctive principles or much inlclil^ef^e^t is
riot surprising that, he has the confidence r?f 6c
few persons, or that bad men control him."

WASHINGTON, MAY 10. et.
I have had a glance at Mr. Secretary For- but]
ward's report and bill in reference to a revised who
tariff, communicated to the House in compliance T
wrth'a resolution of the 29th March last. befo
:*Tue Secretary was called on to give his plan It vt
forraising the necessary amount of revenue for
defraying the expenses of the .government hy an j|
increase of duties on importations; or by auction soro
duties on goods imported or otherwise; also his this
plan in relation to a warehouse system, valua- bee
tio'ff, and cash duties. an ;
i At to auction duties, the Secretary, from go
Mant of information, can, he says, give no opin- pro,
ion. boti
The "home valuation," he says, is impractica- gur^
ide. He submits the plan of the department the
for raising revenue by increase of duties, in a Mr.
Bill. and
The object primarily regarded in framing this n>j
bill was, ho snvs, to supply an amount of reven- pari
- * ? .?( "
ue commensurate with the proLuuia warns utuie ass<
government in future years. nev
A secondary, but important object in view mis
was to a (lord some relief aud encouragement to g0(
the mechanical trades of the country, which are but
languishing. proi
The expenditures for the year 1842,1843, and the
1S44, he estimates at S9S,242,953. The re- triu
ceipts, under his plan, for the same period, inclu- und
ding land fund, at $98,389,300. But this fund f?bo
will, he says, be restored to the Treasury, by the the
passage of his bill, as many of the articles are an
charged at a higher rate of duty than twenty Tin

principle on which the duties on wool, cotton, the
j hemp, iron and leather, and the manufactures f
from them are fixed in this?that they are re- wil
garded as objects of great national concern, and It \
their permanent supply at home essential to our put
real independence. The duties on these arti- me;
j clcs are, in some cases, specific, and range from j per

j Choate, in support orthe bill providing for fur-| rI
1 thcr remedial justice in the U. S. Courts. This a gi
j bill, as you know, was recommended by the to a
President, and is urged for the purpose of pre:
venting collisions with other countries, without
the assent of the Government braKe Union. It
j would seem to most persons lhatf if the Constitu- i
! tion had any purpose, it was to present a common rjve
; front against foreign aggressions. The purpose Vos1
; was to make peace and war a national affair, and mei
, not to leave it to the caprice or the interest of a ton
' single State to provoke a war with a foreign grG
power, or wage a war on her own hook. How- ver

as three o'clock to-day, it is certain Mr. Wise Tel
had received no communication from Mr. Stanly. /
If any thing is to be done it will probably be to- info
morrow. frot
The Madisonian of this morning contains an. trad
authentic account of the collision which toook Aul
place, on Saturday, between Mr. Wise and Mr. stat
Stanly in returning from the race ground. not
1 mentioned that Mr. Forward's proposed du- east
ties ranged between twenty-five and forty per j bee
cent. This is the case generally; tout some of j que
the specific duties proposed are equal to more ; mitt
than an hundred per cent ad valorem. 1300
I am still of the opinion, after conversation ; dow
with many persons interested in the subject,1 Lar
that Congress will not undertake to pass on the . whe
details of a complete revenue system, at this ses-! sev<
1 sion. Whatever they do must be done by the | alar
30th of June, when the last portion of the excess j fors
of duties above twenty per cent goes ofF. It will j fam
he utterly impossible to go into the details of a j cast
plan like Mr. Forward's by that time. Some ; fenc
revenue law' must be passed by that time, else alar
j the importers will take advantage of it, and stock j will
I the country with manufactures in anticipation of; fron
| an increase of duty, thereby defeating the pur- j feci
I poses of the law, at least for a time. I think they ; has

PEECII OF THE H6N. S. H. BUTLER.
We present our readers to-day the extraordiiry
speech of Mr. S. H. Butler, on the extra-dinary
amendment proposed by Mr. Campbell
the apportionment bill. We cannot belieVef
herwise than that this amendment to the bill,- ?
id this speech in its support will strike with
tonishment the people of South ?aroljna^?
fho could have., supposed ra Jiie wildefftraoents
of thought, that such a proposition would
rer have been made .at all, much less-that it J %
lould have been done by a representative of ^"
auth Carolina; and that it should have been sojalously
supported by another representative,
id that representative Ml S. H. Bpxleb, is 2
atter of still greater andohore profound aetonhment.
We acknowledge ourselvesffitter
loss to account for that hallucination which
>uld lead such a man as Mr. Butler to'advoite
a doctrine so totally at wpr witlntll the prinples
upon \vhi?h he has heretofore acted, and
specially of those ultra State-right doctrines of
hich he wasitfe prominent a supporter in this
...tv ^ , *
tate a few years since. _ A mail heretofore so
alous of the least interference On the part of
ie general government with ther rights of the
Lates, or with their internal policy^should not"
ive ventured,.we thug?, on the advocacy* of" a
casure, which; if it be constitutional, and this
doubtful, is beyond all question a dangerous.,
inecessary, and uncaffed for exercise of power,.
It wiiTbe seen-that Mr. Butleb takes for fits
xt the 4th section 6f the 1st article of the conitution,
which is irMhese words; . ^ -grit*
"The times,.ffflaces, and manner ofholdinpr
ection^for sdSBHfs and representati2& .qjfeu
3 prescribed m%ch fijfte by the legf&afW?
lereof; but the congre'sTmay at any timef^jr
tw, makPhr alter suG&regulatioris, except" a*to - ?
ie places of choosing senators." >v-.
The extreme jealousy with .which the framers *
f the Fader^const^jLition endeavored to guard
nd protecf^h'^5vereignty of?the States, and th^
jntcntpOwBBouB" exposition given to this secon,
forbids the supposition that it was intend1
to be exercised, except in those cases where
ie States shall refuse or jieglecrtcrriiahe 'pro- *'
n'legmai'iOljs iui tut ihuiitr u ibpieseiJuflEea.
s proof of this, we refer to the action of the
jveral State conventions to whicluthe constitu- ,*
on was submitted. From these it will be seen
lat six out of the thirteen expressed themselves
i adverse to the exercise of this power, excfept
i above stated; We are not aware that this
irticular section was made the subject of-es- .
;cial notice by the other States. - ]
In the convention of Massachusetts', the;(olwing
amendment was proposed: "That
Congress do not exercisable powers
;sted in them by the 4th section. ofthelst ar:le,
but in cases where a State shall neglect
refuse to make tlie regulations therein meiiDnedJ"
Our own State, South Carolina, then as^nbw,
id always watchful of her right6, after having
tified the constitution, made the following somn
declaration on this subject :
"And whereas it is,essential to the preseiya>n
of the rights reserved to the several.'States,
id the freedom of Hie people, under the operants
of a general government, that the right "of
escribing the manner, time, and places of hol8g
elections to the Federal legislature shotted
forever inseparably annexed to the sovereignty
the several States: This convention doth deare
that the same ought to remain, to all pos~ *
ntu, a perpetual and fundamental right in the
cal, exclusive of the interference of the gene1
government, except in cases Vhere the leslature
of the States shall refuse or neglect to ^
irtorm ana iumi the same, according to tn8v
nor of the said constitution."
And as though this might not be considered
fficiently expressive, the convention before its
lal adjournment adopted the following resoluin:
"Resolved, That it be a standing instruction tot
1 such delegates as may hereafter be elected
represent this State in the general govefn2nt,
to exert their utmost abilities and'induce
to effect an alteration of the constitution,
nformably to the aforegoing resolutions."
With these solemnly expressed^ opinions be e
them, we cannot percei^e. how Messrs.
vmpbell and Butler could have^rought theralves
into the position in which we jffnd tbem. ?
Virginia comes next with her vigilant eye to
an this dangerous provision of the Federal
nstitution. Hear her convention expressing
lelf as follows:
"That Congress shall not alter, modify or inrfere
in the tirade, places, or manner of holdg
elections for Senators and. Representatives,
either of them, except when the legislature of
ly State shall neglect, refuse, or be, disabled,
' invasion or rebellion, to prescribe the same."
In addition to this, the convention-adopted a
solution of instruction, similar, or nearly so, to
at "of our own State. .
Tv Next
in the list we find the EmpireSt^te, New
ork, speaking with a voice which should not go
iheeded. .
Among other amendments proposed by the ^
invention of New-York, was the following:
