PLOUGHING IN STRAW.
Straw ihat has become fully ripe, contains
bu> a very small portion of soluble matter,
the remainder being insoluble fiber, which,
except under particular circumstances, is
not decomposed in the soil, under several
years. For this reason it affords very little
nutriment to growing plants, when ploughed
under before it has undergone decomposition.
Instead, therefore, of adopting the
practice, which is now becoming so prevalent,
of ploughing in straw in the early part
of autumn, wewould recommend that it be
kept over winter for the purpose of preserving
the soluble juices of barn yard manure.
Straw is always needed in waiter as Dens
lor domestic animals, contributing much to
i heir health and cleanliness, and consequently
to the profits of the farmer; and where
it is to be had in large quantities, and is not
needed for fodder, it should housed plentifully
as litter for them, it will thus act as
a sjxjnge, and retain the richest ;uid most
easily dissipated portions of the manure,
which generally run off in a liquid state in
a black rivulet from the foot of the mass, and
are either wholly evaporated or lost in the
ground. The manure would in turn assist
in the decomposition of the straw, breaking
up its dry and hardened fiber and reducing
? ? I 1:?i .1.^
it to a state in to ue appueu tu mu ova*
On light and porous soils, unfcrinontcd
straw should never be ploughed under, tiie
benefit in such cases being very trifling, if
any at all; but in hard and clayey grounds,
considerable advantage is sometimes derived
from the practice, by its rendering the
soil less compact and more permeable by
air and water.
The above remarks are intended to apply
to straw and ail s'alks of plants which
have become fully ripe. Jf they are used
while in a green state, and slightly fermented
in a heap, they will furnish twenty times the
amount of nutriment to growing plants, that
dry straw does. Succulent plants may be
even turned under fresh, and they will be
readily decomposed in the soil. Ilencegreen
crops of clover are ploughed in to great
advantage.?Ibid.
IMPROVEMENT.
Farmers should aim at constantly improving
the soii of their farms?they should
study the existing defects, and endeavor, as
fast as circumstances wilt permit, to remedy
them ;?if their land is too wet, they should
drain it,?if too stitFand clayey, they should
apply loosening m mures,?if light and sterile,
they should make use of green crops of
clover as manure, with plaster, and lime,?
if sour, (generally indicated by the growth
of sorrel, broom grass, or scrub pines,) they
should apply lime or marl;?and in all
cases they should apply all the enriching
manure they can possibly obtain, for good
farming, and the application of manure, are
inseparable. They will thus not only increase
their capital by the increased pro1

do it by the constantly augmenting vaU.e of
their land ; their profits will be two-fold, and
iu their increase mutually accelerate each
other.?Ibid.
ASHES AS MANURE FOR GRASSLANDS.
There is scarcely any part of the country,
where leached ashes cannot be obtained
in greater or less quantity ; and in the vicinity
of asheries, abundance may generally be
had with no other expense than drawing.
If the following remarks by Count Chaptai
are applicable to soils of whatever materials
they may be composed, a knowledge of
this property of leached ashes, would in
many instances be of very great value. At
all events, the experiment is easily perform
ed oq a moderate scale.
"The ashes, produced by the combustion
of wood in our common domestic fires, give
rise to some very remarkable results.?
Without being leached these ashes are much
too active, but after having been deprived,
by the action of water, of nearly all their salts,
and employed in this state, under the name
of buck-dshcsy they still produce great effect.
"The action of the buck-ashes is most
powerful upon moist lands and meadowsy in
which thev not only facilitate the growth of
useful plants, but if employed constantly for
several years, they will free the soil from
iceeds. By the use of them, land constantly
drenched With water may be freed from
rushes, and prepared for yielding clover and
other plants of good kinds."
It has been frequently supposed that ashrs
applied to wet heavy soils is injurious.
This is probably owing to the application
being too uneven, and in large quantities,
aud to the want of mixing them intimately
with the soil. Chaptal says, "Wood ashes
possess the double property of amending a
wet and clayey soil bv dividing and drying
it, and of promoting vegetation by the salts
they contain.'*
It is well known, that the evenly spread
and intimately intermixed lu^er of ashes
which soils receive by burning the turf, produces
extraordinary effects upon grass lands.

A NEW BREED OF SHEEP.
The subjoined advertisement was cut out
of the Hampshire Chronicle, an English pa.
per, of the 20th of May last, and sent to us
by a friend for publication. We thank him
! for his polite attention, and insert it with
j pleasure. The information it contains we
I know will be gratefully received by our readj
ers, as it will give probably the first notice
! of a very superior new breed of sheep, that
has appeared in our country.

One hundred half-breed Co'swold and
Down Tegs, bred by myself and brother,
and fed bv Mr. Cannon, Maidennead, Berks,
shorn on the loth of March last, then 13 1-&
months old. produced, on an average, nine
poundsof wool each. Ten were immedi-!
atcly sold at Cos. ten at 62s. and the last 20
culls of the hundred, at 53s. each, out of
' their wool, for which 2s. per lb. has been
1 refused. Calculating the wool at this price,
the 100 fegs have produced 400/. or 4/. per
head. I seek in vain for a parallel in the piesen\
or a reward of a similar price in any
past age, Peel's Bill or 12s. 6d. notes
turned into 20s. gold pieces, notwithstanding.
The eight half-bred Tegas 1 exhibited
at Bomsey produced 80 1-4 lbs.of wool;
over 10 bs. each. The two years old ram
(half-breed) l-"? 1.0 lbs. clean and well wash,
ed?all of which may be seen.
On 770 acres of arable and meadow land
we keep G20 breeding ewes and 220 fegs,

fold, and always at home. Can our crack

with a like number in proportion to across?
; Five years impartial trial of this cross emboldens
me to declare myself open to the
world, to match it against any other breed,
taking as the criterion of inerit, the combiI

SALE OF A CROP OF LAST TEAR?S WHEAT.
Baptist Mczichr, Esq., sold we learn, on
Thursday last, his entire crop of wheat
J grown in 1S;3.">, at his beautiful estate about
! twenty miles from Baltimore, on the Chesa|
peake, for $2,40 for white, and 2,20 for red.
; per bushel. These are fine prices, and will
remunerate this gentleman well for its cultivation,
and the interest of the money while
he kept it on hand ; but high as they evidently
are for wheat, we do not bolieve that
it has yet reached its maximum price:?
and, indeed, unless we should have liberal
importations from across the ocean, it will
be a diffident task to say what price it may
not reach before the harvesting of the next
year's crop.?Ibid.

TURKISH PREPARATION' OF TOMATO.

appears to appreciate the vegetable at its
just value. Without, however, agreeing
with your correspondent in all its claims to
excellence as an important article of the Materia
Medica, I conceive we have nothing
to equal it in giving pungency and flavor to
our commonest dishes. It is great desideratum
to have it at all seasons of the year,
and some of your readers will doubtless
feel obliged by learning bow to obtain it in
a simple, easy, and economical manner. In
Turkey, it is a universal favorite, and enters
into the composition of all their sauces. I
frequently saw it made, and the following
recipe may be depended on, as it was corrected
under the eye of the good-house-wife
herself.
The tomatoes are first washed in a weak

1 u il the following day; then squeeze them
thoroughly by hand, throwing away skins.
The pulpy mass is strained through a fine
cloth to prevent the seeds from passing
through, it is then salted; put into shallow
carthern dishes and exposed to the sun for
12 days, or until it becomes thick paste. It
should he stirred with a wooden spoon twice
a day while exposed to the sun. It is then
fit for use. With respect to the quantity to
be added to the paste, the rule is to put a
handful and a half to the pulp of a hundred
tomatoes, il'large, and less if small.
Those who prepare Tomatoes in this
way will be surprised at the small quantity
obtained ; but their surprise will cease when
they learn how far it will go. A hit not lar:
ger than a Lima bean will be sufficient to
flavor the soup of a family of 20 persons;
and a much smaller quantity for sauces.
A small pot which I brought with me, containing
about half a pint, lasted my family
more than a year, and we used it very
freely,
i l>v stirring it frequently, fresh portions
, are exposed to the sun, and the salt is more
thoroughly incorporated with it. The rule
of 12 days holds good at Constantinople,
and I think would be sufficient here. At
any rate, it should be thoroughly dried, covering
it over or night, it becomes of the
"oc^s'rr'CiC rf hard h ,Mrr- ?
I have planted a large quantity of tomatoes,
and shall make the sauce according to sot
the above recipe. Should an opportunity Ho

Chinese Mulberry.?Although defoliation I
might injure or destroy some trees and veg-' .
etablcs, the leaves being to the vegetable . 1S.|
what lungs and stomach are to animal life, j
it does not follow that all trees and vegc-1 ?
tables sutler alike by defoliation. The | *ei
grasses, the box, the willow, and some oth-'
ers, may be cur, headed down, or the leaves i
nlucked. almost for an indefinite period, with- t!lr

out effecting destruction. Do not old pas- j ll.?
tures produce better and sweeter grasses by j
frequent cropping, than when first laid down ? *n<
Shall it then be thought wonderful that the "n
Chinese Morus Multicaulis will bear defoliation
several times during the same sea
???n
son ? From experiments already made, it j va
appears that this valuable plant has been as
plucked of its leaves for feeding worms, ,
* lop
not less than four or five times, without any
injury to its growth?but the leading shoots
must not be topped?and every successive 0
crop of leaves are improved in number and bP'
weight. At the same time the wood is ac de
quiring hardness for future use. If the ob- sta
iftpf he the formation of wood, then take oft* e'n
the leading end of the-tree or shoot. Anoth- J'"
er excellency of the of the Chinese mulber- "5
ry is the richness of its leaffor feeding worms; .
while 100 pounds of white mulberry leaves nis
are required to feed worms sufficient to sl*
make one bushel of cocoons, 75 to 80 of the *
Morus Multicaulis will do the same thing;
and while it is a full day's work to pick 100
lbs. of white mulberry leaves?with the same
labor 500 lbs. of the Morus Multicaulis i |jlr
might be collected. And while it is gene-;
rally allowed that it requires about 5000 j P*1
worms fed on white mulberry to make one J
bushel of cocoons, the same quantity of co- r?'
coons have the present year been made
with 2000 worms fed with the Cinese mulberrv.

A TALK OF RUM AND RUIN. m<
Mr. , was the only child of his r'
parents.?He was the pride of his father, and
idol of his mother. He possessed an amia
(ra
ble disposition, and was uncommonly kind ?l
in his feelings. To her fondness, his mother
united excessive indulgence; so much so, j.
that she could not find it in her heart to deny
him any request. Nothing marked his early
years, hut in 1822, when at the age of 13 or
10, he became convinced that his amiable
disposition and kind deportment would not
secure him the favour of God, and it was wi
hoped he then applied for pardon to the an
blood of Christ. Soon after he united with to
the church in his native place, and erected inj
an altar where morning and evening, he met ev
his parents, and offered up their family sac- th<

here ! a dear and only son, asking spiritual the
blessings on those who lavished on him all an
their temporal comforts ! But while enjoy- at
ing this almost heavenly happiness, motives qu
unknown to the writer, induced the parents frc
to exchange their peaceful residence, for the J a
noise and bustle of a country tavern. lie toi
had not been long in his new abode, before pu
a lady, whose heavenly hopes corresponded str
with his, came to the village on a visit to her ha
friends, with whom he formed a marriage
connexion. He carried her to the home of wr
his parents; and where could he find more ed
promise of domestic enjoyment? They cri
were devoted to his happiness, and he to yo
tiieir's, and as he was sole heir to their com- on
potency, his prospects were flattering for his "1<
rising family. { i
Although the religious exercises of the ar
family had tenderly affected the hearts of sir
the parents, yet they thought best to dispense oh
with these in the tavern, as they might be sp
an interruption to travellers, and soon, both nv
with the father and son, the first morning ha
oblation was at the shrine of Bacchus !?It nr
was not long before the youth began Jre- by
qwntly to sip at the intoxicating cup, and wi
soon his downward course began to be visi- rrr
bio. He was not seen in the place where ed
prayer was wont to be made, and his voice, ev
instead of ascending in the application to his
God, was heard only in the drunkards revcliings,
and shocking to relate, in blaspheming
that name he had once worshipped. ni<
I'lv Sabbath was no longer a delight, nor ha
Mho ;,oiy niar?of Herd honorable.' nv
It was a long time before either father or f
1 would drink in each other's presence, v
rh seemed to think the other was in dan- t;
, and the father particularly discovered xiety
about the habits of the son. It o
uld seem that the mother should have c
:*n first to take alarm at this indulgence v
his appetite, and bv a mother's tears and 5
rcaties, which no uncommon hardihood ii
1 resist, prevent his untimely ruin. But tl
unge as it may seem, she could not deny n
fi, even the poison that would destroy him, ti
1 furnished the intoxicating beverage, ti
m when the judgment of the intemperate v
her would have deprived him of if. tl
cannot be supposed that the church were c
concerned spectators of the melancholy f<
ection of this youth. Private Christians tl
rned him ; committees were appointed to n
iverse with, and try to reclaim him, and p
ir every other means failed, the steps 1
inted out in the Gospel were regularly ta- a
a ; and he was separated from their com- q
inion. f
Peace and quietness had, long before this, v
d irom his abode, and unkindness fell r
m those lips, which once were never open- a
but to give pleasure to those around. It '
not my purpose, however, to reveal in de- s
I the domestic misery of that family cir- t
or speak of the anguish arising from bro- c
ri vows and congugal unkindness. These
3 known to the family of the intemperate, i
thout description, and the most lively pic- 'f
e cannot portray thein to the imagina- !(
ii of other*. Suffice it to say, that after *
; or seven years, she returned, to her 1
jnds, the mother of two promising chil-11
;n, and the neglected wife of a drunkard, j
As is usual in such cases, every restraint j
it was removed, opened wider the path, j
ty to ruin, and all looked upon him now j
lost.
A few months before his death, a travel,
took lodgings at his father's and with his
reshment, ordered a glass of cold water,
inc conversation followed, in which he
3ke of the length of time that he had thus
nicd himself, and the importance of abtining
from all that can intoxicate. This '

that God whom he once professed to *

seeh was remembered when he died, as
i day of his death was to have deprived .
n of the products of that bar, by the remo- ;
I of his parents to another residence. ]
During the winter of 1335?0, he gave ,
nselfup more completely to revelry and '
ankenness, andfhis parents, in order to
ve, if possible, this wreck of all their earth- (
hopes, sold their tavern, and resolved to ^
nove from the public use ot that, which

manded lor supper, a choice dish which |
e had reserved for travellers. His mother j
monstruted with him, told him of tiie im- |
ssibilitv of procuring more, &c., but this (
ly increased his rage, and he swore by ;

went to hollas a recompense!! His ,

CURE FOR A PASSIONATE TEMPER. 1
A merchant in London having a dispute
th a quaker, respecting the settlement of
account, the merchant was determined 1
bring this question into court, a proceed. '
I the Quaker earnestly deprecated, using (
ery argument in his power to convince 1
j merchant of error; but the latter was
lexiblc.. Desirous to make his last effort, j
i Quaker called at his house one morning
d inquired of the servant if his master was |
home. The merchhnt hearing the inirv,
and knowing the voice, called aloud
>m the top of the stairs, lTeil that rascal '
im not at home." The quakerlooking up
,vards him calmly said, "Well friend, God
t thee in a better mind."?The merchant,
uck with the meekness of the reply, and
ving more deliberately investigated the
itter, became convinced that the Quaker <
is right and he was wrong, fie request- ;
to sec him and after acknowledging his j
ror ho said, "I have one question to ask 11
u?how were you able, with such patience <
various occasions, to hear my abuse?"
'riend," replied the Quaker, I will toll thee: i
vas. naturally as hot and violent as thou I
t. 1 knew that to indulge this temper was <
i, and I found that if was imprudent. I <
served that men in a passion always 1
oak aloud ; and 1 thought if I could control ;
y voice, I should suppres my passion. I i
ve therefore made it a rule never to suffer i
y voice to rise above a certain key; and \
a careful observance of this rule, I have, ;
th the blessing of (rod, entirely mastered i
y natural temper."?The Quaker reason, j
Piiilanthropically, and the merchant, as
cry one else may do, was benefitted by
i example.

Iodine in Consumption.?The external
ipplication of iodine to the chest is a mode

which I consider at once safe
tnd eflicacious. When an ointment pre.

Iriodate of potash, one part of iodine, and
en or twelve oarts of ointment, is applied to
he surface of the chest, especially over the
)art corresponding to that which is diseas)d
of one or more lungs, in such quantities
o give rise to a considerable degree of
cutaneous inflammation, it will mostly be
bund to produce a great improvement in
he state of the affected portion or portions
)f the Jung or lungs, provided its use be
continued for a sufficient length of time. I g
lave repeatedly found, after the continued t
application of Iodine ointment to the chest r
br some months, that the general local f
symptoms, and all the physical signs of the t
presence of tubercular formation of the \
ungs, were completely removed. 1

Magnanimity and gratitude of a Lion.?
Prince, a tame lion, on board his majesty's

was much attached; the keeper got drunk t
one day, and, as the captain never forgave ^

(logged; the grating was rigged on the main ,
deck, opposite Prince's den, a large barred j
up place, the pillars strong and cased with <
iron. When the keeper began to strip, J
Prince rose gloomly from his couch, and ^
^ot as near to his friend as possible; on be- *
holding his bar back, he walked hastily
round the den, and when lie saw the boatswain
inflict the lirst lash, his eyes sparkled \
with fire, and sides resounded with the strong ^

that it is possible to conceive. The captain

licked with care the mangled and bleeding 1
back of the cruelly treated seaman, cales- 1

after several hours that Prince would allow 1

The effects of the Treasury Circular are
beginning to be seen. Specie has almost
entirely disappeared from circulation; and
as for gold, but precious little of it has ever
glistened in this part of the country, although
we were promised floods of it two 1
or three years since. The Jacksonville
Patriot says: "In this place you cannot
now obtain specie for a five dollar
bill." The paper circulation is becoming
dailv more depreciated, and general resort
must be had, by our merchants and
business men generally, to a system of shaving.
They will be doing injustice to
themselves, should they continue to sell
their goods at fair prices?receive uncurrent
and depreciated paper at par in payment?
and then pass it over to the broker at a discount
of three, five, and ten per cent., for
gold silver, or such money as will be received
at the desk of the bank.?Repub.
The Corn Trade.?Bread-stuffs have
hitherto constituted one of our principal articles
of export, amounting in 1831 to within
a small fraction of 812,000,000. In 1835,
(we speak, in both cases, of the commercial
year, ending 3Sth ^p'embor,) the quantity *
ras reduced one-half, and the value in about
le same proportion. In 1 S32, the value
readestuffs imported was only #1,032,
'hereasin 1835 it had increased to $311,16.
The year ending the 30th of the prejnt
month will show still smaller exports
f these articles, and larger imports; and the
nsuing year, from present appearances,
ill very possibly show an amount of imorts
equal to the exports. Should the
orn crop be cut off in the northernmost
tates, as it is now very liable to be, by the I
nrly appearance of frost, the extraordinary
henomenon will probably occur, of the -4
reatest grain-growing country in the world
ccoming dependent upon foreign countries

THE LAND MANIA.
If the capitalists who are buying up the
public lands could increase the agricultural,
manufacturing, and mercantile population
of the United States at their pleasure, they
would be masters of an almost unlimited
wealth.
There is but little agricultural produce exported
from the United States. Nearly ail
the world is at peace; so may it long continue.
Agriculture is improving, and the
soil of almost every country supplies its inhabitants
with brettd.
In this state of things, which, for any thing
we see, is likely to continue for an indefinite
period of time, agricultural industry in the
United States cannot with advantage be ex
tended much beyond the supply of the wants
of the population of the United States. Tho
amount of our exports of grain and provisions
is the merest fraction, compared with
the quantity consumed in the country ; not
more perhaps than the one-hundredth part.
We all know that an extension of agricultural
productions beyond a corresponding
increase in the o.her branches of industry,
(the mercautile, manufacturing, <&c.)
will be unavoidably attended by a diminution
of the profits of agricultural industry.
A limited quantity of bread is required
; there is a limited amount of means
to pay lor it. In proportion as the producers
of this bread are multiplied, their profits
will !>e diminished. When the profits
of other branches of industry, capital and
labor arc withdrawn from the less profitable
business, and seek another that yields a
better profit.
The demand for agricultural produce
being limited, it is obvious that the demand
for land must likewise be limited.
It is true that the population of the United
States increases las^r than the population
of any otljcr country, and this requires
u corresponding extension of agricultural
industry. There has been such an increase;
a considerable part of the Mississippi and
the country of the Upper Lakes has been
brought under cultivation within the last
thirty-five years. But an immeasurably
greater portion still remains.
Since the great West has been opened
for settlement under the auspices of Congress,
something upwards of two hondred
millions of acres have been surveyed and
brought into market. Up to the beginning
of the present year, but little over thirty
