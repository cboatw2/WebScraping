bint ill Transplanting.
The common error in transplanting trees,
is not making the boles, or pits, for their re.
ception sufficiently broad and deep. The
roots require a mellow soil to strike down
and horizontally in; and if the earth under
8nd arouud them is left undisturbed and
hard, they can not extend themselves for
food, or but very slowly; the plant consequently
grows but slowly, if it survives.*?
The following experiment, made by M.
Chalermeau, illustrates the importance of
this hint. The bole should not be proportioned
to the extent of the roots as (hey are,
but to their extent as they may he and should
be.
"Four peach trees, resembling each oth.
er as to size and vigor of growth, as much
as possible, were planted. No. I in a hole
three feet square; No. 2 in a hole two feet
square, and Nos. 3 and 4 in holes eighteen
inches square. The soil and exposition
similar. No. J has every year given the
most abundant crops, and the relative sizes
of the trees are now as follows: the stem
of No. 1, 18 feet high and 8 inches in circumference
; that of No. 2,0 feet high and
6 1.2 inches in circumference; No. 3,6 feet
hi?h and 3 inches 8 lines in circumference; \
~ - ,
and No. 4, 5 1-2 foot high and 8 ioches in i
circumference." I
S!rowing a difference between No. 1 and <
No* 4?between large holes and small holes i
?of five inches in circumference, and I
12 1-2 feet in height. Apple, pear and <
forest trees generally having a larger spread
of roots than the peach, require proportion- i
ally larger holes. <

Oil Field Cotton, Ac.
Mr. Editor,?It is a common practice i
With most ofour plantors to put their fresh i
or best lands in cotton, for that very obvious s
reason, that that Staple requires good land 1
to make it produce profitably, while by !
planting their.poor or worn-out lands in corn,
which may be easily manured, they may
cause it to produce in a proportionate de.
gree. ft is not my purpose to condemn this
system, but rather to suggest a mode that
in some instances may supersede it, and be
of equal or greater advantage to the farmer,
at least so far as to reserve more of his good
land for corn. Travelling some year* ago
through the middle part of Georgia, I had
occasion to stop a few days at the house of
a thriving and hospitable planter, residing
on the Ogeeche river. During my stay,
he took occasion to show me his plantation,
which consisted of pine land, lying very
well, and a small portion ofhammock on the
river, fo many of bis fields, not a tree and
very few stumps even, were to be seen. But
the cotton was growing very luxuriant y on
one of them, of pine land. I of course concluded
that it nad been manured, and that
well, though at a loss to conjecture the means
he had used to manure so large a space for
cotton. Judge my surprise, when he informed
me he had not put a particle of ma.
Dure on it for many years?not since he
commerced planting it in cotton. He then
stated that he had pursued the following
system in planting cotton upon his old lands;
He had previously listed his field for cotton
during the winter, whenever opportunities
offered by throwing three furrows together
?the row a being laid ott three or three teet
and a half apart. The first year, of course,
ht opened and planted his seed in the cen.
tre of the ridge, and tended the crop ac.
cordingly ; which, ho observed to me, was
o very poor one : the stalks not growing,
generally, more than " half-Ieg high," as he
expressed it, or about twelve or fourteen
inches; and the best not more than knee
high. The next spring, when ready to plant
again, instead of listiug his ground in the
* step," or between the rows, as is usual,
where land is successively planted in the
same kind of prodrce, he merely ran a fur.
row on the old ridge, along side of the for.
mer row of cotton, after beating down the
old stalks??and without tearing up any more
of them than can be avoided. The experiment,
in due season began to promise very
fair. Tbe cotton all over the field that year
averaged knee high, or more. He pursued
the same plan the next year, running per.
haps the furrow on the side opposite to the
one where he had run it the year provious.
but on the same ridge. The result was
ao increase in the growth of the cotton
plant, as well as io the product?and he con.
tinned the same process each succeeding
year, and #heo I saw the field, which was
in the latter part of the summer, the stalks
were nearly three feet high, and very well
formed. It was perhaps the fifth or sixth
year he had been planting in that manner.
I have never had an opporiunity of testing,
myself the virtue of this system, but
doubt not that it is a very good one. It is
evident that there is muih matter in the
roots of the cotton stalks to produce ma.
nure?and it may be that the soil of the
bed being unexposed to the sun, may improve,
and retain nutriment much longer. I
have merely made this suggestion with the
hope that it may be improved, as there are
many farmers who plant very poor and old
lands in cotton, without manure, and .iral
?f It can be of no injury. The tabor ?#
nothing more, and if any thing les9, as it
saves at least half the ploughing, necessary
before planting. It may be proper to add,
thai the greatest and I may say the only in.
convenience attending the cul ivation of a
crop in this manner, is the thinning ofit out
~tho stems of the old stalks being in the
' way of the hoe; but with a Mtte more tnan
common care, thir may be obviated.
I will state as a corroborating fact, in sup.
port of this system, and an experiment
which suggested itself to me, afier hearing
what I have stated. I planted in corn, an
old field, which had lain out many years.
It produced but a very ordinary crop,
though well tended, and experiencing good
seasons. The following year, when ready
to plant the same field, I run a furrow
through the same hills, without oven li ting,
and dropped the com in the old hills. I ga*
thered that year upwards of one third more
from the same field. The field was plan,
ted four feet square, one stulk in each hill.

of their wealth. I do not ask you to
count their friends, or to trace the connections
which these children may have formed,
or to enumerate those sad hours which bear
them back to their native land. But ask
them how much clear money they have on
hand each year after all is paid, and then
inquire how much property they can pur.

accession to their visible wealth or comforts;
if they number no more slaves, and have no

vails any high imaginary value, which in
conformity with the fashion of that country,

hearts, they do not wish they had never

very comforting of one day returning thith.
er.
But to my calculations. I do not desire
to appeal to feelings, but to the interest, and
to show that the coutse which the heart so
naturally dictates, the understanding may
justly sanction.
I will assume that every ordinary cotton
planter in this State can plant to each full
task hand, ten acres of cotton and eight a~
cres of corn, potatoes, &c. The quantity
and tho proportions vary I know. In the
stiff up-country soil they may plant less ;
each are frequently planted. In fact most
of the middle country planters cultivate',
eleven or twelve acres of cotton, make pro K
visions, and in the corresponding reg on^a
Georgia, fifteen acres ofcotron, besides com,
is not extraordinary. If there is any one
who can .lot cultivate ten acres of cotton
and raise an ample supply ofprovisioos, he
does not uuderstand his business or does
not give it his attention, without which no
business can prosper, and he should change
his occupation or his habits, or?emigrate*
I will assume that each ucre will produce
125 lbs. of ginned cotton. If it will not d$
tin's, under the system of resting, I shall re*
commend And base my calculations on,
it is not worth cultivating, and while there is
as much land in this State, in almost every
section of it, to bo had on such moderate
* ?'"I-I- ?til rrtnoh. hshas
leruis, wui^u w*u ^ivuuvo >? ;
no excuse for cultivating it. I say gin*
ned cotton, because the moment you begin
to estimate the product in cotton in the seed,
you are in the skies. As our cotton is usu.
ally weighed wet and dry, basket end trash,
by overseers and drivers, with ell sorts of
steelyards, no planter can tell what amount
he is to sell, even if ha keeps a statement of
bis pickings, much less can he form any
iden from seeing the cotton in the field. I
always inquire how much ginned cotton an
acre will produce ??how much ginned cot.
ton a hand will make ? It would be nearly
as satisfactory to know how many piles of
rails he can split, as how many bags he
makes. According to this estimate, a full
task hand will bring into the market 1250
lbs. of cotton. He is not, however, a first
rate planter who does not make 1,500 lbs.
on land that will produce 125 lbs. per acre. <
I know many planters in this State who
make more?and he who does not make at i
least 1,250 lbs. may bo sure that there is i
something radically wrong about his busi. !
ness, which, if he cannot correct, he is not i
suited to the occupation. Topla&howev. i
er, with success, and make this product :
moderate as it is, perfectly sure, every one 1
planting in light and thin lands should have !
twice ss much open land, as he can culii. I
vate, so that he can rest every o her year, i
or plant two and rest two, which perhaps i
is preferable. He should iherefore havo I
thiriy.six acres of open land for every hand, <
to which I will add, say fourteen acr^s of i
woodland, which will be amply sufficient I
for every purpose, and will make the aggre. <
gate quantity of land per hand, fifty acres.
No planter should have more. 1 know that <
many do, not only hero but at iho West and i
every where else. One wants an outlet here i
or there?another is avaricious of all the i
privileges of his neighborhood?others i
think M land is safe propertyand others i
again are ambitious of owning lurge landed I
estates. This is bad economy, and paying I
a h? avy tribute to pride. There i3 nothing ]
so expensive as dead real estate, and num? 1
bers who debar themselves of many of th? !
comforts of life, seem never to reflect on I
the thousands which they annually lose in .
interest on idle lands. It is vain for us here i
to purchase and hold lands, expecting their \
value to appreciate. The spirit of that sort i
of speculation has long sinco flown over, us, ]
never to return. Local causos may pro. <
luce rises, and 1 believe there has been a i
steady, though slow one on pine lands for i
some years?but taking the aggregate va.
lue of the real estate of the whole State, I <
doubt if it is so great at present ns it was
forty yeirs ago, inflated as prices are just <
now. At this moment, however, land such
as will produce 125 lbs. of cotton, cannot
be estimated higher than $5 per acre. If

ding more on the neighborhood than the. t
quality?and, in all probability, these lands c
may ?.ot be much higher for generations, c
awaiting the slow process of increasing ?
population to advance their value. The t
value of a full task hand maybe estimated ?
here nt about 8900?and his expenses on i
the plantation per annum, including his ?
tarre of the overseer's wages, doctor's bill, i
clothing, iron, salt, bagging, mules, wagons, ?
gear and meat, (if the planter cannot raise i
his meat, which in general may easily be i
done) and all o.her consumable plantation a
necessaries, I will put down at 850. Long c
experience and strict accounts have taught t
me that this is a fair average, though I im- f
agine most planters will think it is too much r
?especially if they do not keep a full mem- orandum
of expenses. t
Now let us turn to the Western country, t
According to tne opinions of the most ac. 1.
curate and judicious Western planters, 1 t
have seen, ?t may be assumed, that 2000 I
lbs. of ginned cotton per hand is a very t
good average crop?probably far above f
the overage. Wo hear of immense pro. i
duction9 of seed cotton per acre, and of t
bags per lian I, which cannot be properly v
tented or estimated. I have no doubt 2,. x
500 or 3000 lbs. are sometimes made, but c
I think I might say, wi hout much fear of <1
contradiction,that there are few planters who f
cannot compromise at 2000 lbs,, one year t
with another. Assuming thrt ten acres of r
cotton ana enly six of com are planted per p
hand, and that from the qualify of the soil, >
it requires less rest, the best of lands reqnire d
some, I will only allow ior that purpose, and c
for small grain, <fcc. four acres more of open t
land, and ten instead of fourteen of wood- e
land, which will give an aggregate of thir- t
ty acres per hand. Idaresayj as among c
ourselves, most planters there have more ; c
and certainly this cannot be considered a i;
large cs.imatc, compared with that allowed v
our own planters. For this land, in almost f
any part of the West, with a tolerable set- i
tlement on it, and a small proportion of it t
cleared, at least 820 per acre must be paid t
?often much more?seldom less. I mean t
Df course such land as w 11 year after year s
make an average of 200 lbs. cotton to the c
icro. A good hand in the West may be c
yet down as worth 81200?perhaps at this c
moment, on account of the extraordinary t
" ? - ? ;n ?. u_:?
stair oi tilings, nc win uu. unug u m cuo/?, , <
bu: lam told much more can be obtained for j c
iiira even now on credit, 1 think therefore, I
[ am justified in valuing him at that sum. t
The annual expenses of a hand in the W est,
tA*tu4ing nil the items included in expenses (
here, may be fairly rated at 850 per man. j
Men with us a: $75. Those who have tried I
it will hardly accuse me of exaggerating I
this item. If any planter is startled by the c
estimate I make of the plantation expenses, i
let him for five years keep an exact account <
of every cent expended for articles not i
raised, hut consumed on his plantation, by j
no means excluding mules and wagon, 1
which are usually worn out there, and his c
doubts will vanish.
Now, from all these data, or perhaps i |
ought to say assumptions, let us make the i
following tables, the more clearly to exhibit t
the difference between planting here and in i
the West.* t

If these calculations are, as I believe cor- c
ect, I might well ask if any one could be c
nduced to break up here and emigrate to t
he West for such a prospect ef oettering t
lis fortu ies ? It may be said that if the r
ralue of a hand is, by the simple fact, of renoval
to the West, enhanced 25 per cent., '
t is not proper to charge that enhanced value t
o the aggregate of cap tal there, and re- t
juire interest on if, when compared with i
tapital here. When a planter remains here <J
tad expends here the produce of his capital c
here, it would appear as though there w re
:ome reason in tfie objection. 1 grant that r
fan owner can remain stationary, and by s
limply removing his capital, can increase c
t largely and make it produce as safely and r
is certainly there the same interest upon 1
ts increased that it did hereon its original t
ralue, he would be a gainer. But there a
ire many difficulties in the way of this view s
>fthe matter. First, the expense of getting s
he capital there. Secondly, the large ex- c
lend ture in provisions, mules and utensils, li
lecessary to put his plantation in operation ci
?all of which I have embraced under the r
lead of annual expenses, and not added to c
he capital by my calculation above. Third, r
y, the great loss of time that must occur i<
lefore land can be opened so as to make a 2
ull crop, even when a fair settlement has il
>een purchased in the first instance ; and a
ourthly, the great risk, not only in remov- i
ng, but in keeping negroes in a clime no- c
oriously unfavorable to their health, and IS
rhere the mortality among them exceeds c
vhat it is wilh us, probably the full amount t
if nPf p.Rnt. Thnsp difficulties nre great I c
Irawbacks on the gain by the mere trans- t
er of property, and I think would entitle me f
o pass over that point altogether; but let ]
ne add that I shall by no mt ans allow a nett c
irofit of $165 per hand for an average of li
rears at 12 cts. for cotton to a planter resi- c
ling here, and trusting his hand to mere
iverseera in the west. I would neither give 1
hem 2000 lbs. a 3 ear, nor would I pay their c
ixpenses for $75 per annum. In short, 1 I
iclieve all will agree with me, that the idea g
if living here and planting there with no e
ither dependence than a hireling manager, c
s a perfect fallacy. If the planter removes t
vith his hands, then the true measure of tns t
irofits is the rate of interest they produce I
lim on his capital estimated at its value ?
here, where its proceeds are to be laid out j
tther in increasing his property or adminis. |
ering to his comfotts. And here let me 1
lay, that the increase of one hulf of one per j
:ent. will bear no proportion to the increase j
if his family expenditures, and that with j
wen a plantation of fifty hands, his nddi- \
ional income of $450, or at most $975,
vill fall short of his additional wan's. Not
>nly will he find every thing mucn dearer,
jut the style of living, so far as mere show
md style are concerned, is far above ours. (
There is another drawback thai 1 have not (
jstimated, which subtracts largely from the (
jrofus of the Western planter. I allude to (
he inconvenience and heavy expense of ,
jetting his produce to market, and the enormous
charges of all kinds upon it. This J
s a heavy item?but one which I admit is (
disappearing with tne advance of improve- (
nents?at least so fur as the facilities of
getting to market are concerned, but not, I
jelieve, as regards the charges in the nark- J
?

In short, Mr. Editor, every thing consid. '
?red, I cannotbut regard the whole scheme J
}f Western fortuie-hunting as a splendid '
Jelusion, and I trust that I may have con- 1
zinced some others of the same opinion. 1
Many a worthy and industrious citizen em* 1
grates thither, encounters all the dangers 1
and difficulties of the pioneer, fells the for- '
ssta, opens the fields, tills the rich soil with
anwearied care, and sends its ample products |
o the markets. His fortune grows apace I
?yet, looking around and comparing him- ;
self with others, he does not find that he '
npproaches that immense wealth which he I
anticipated when he left home, friends, and I
he charms of civil zotion for the Western )
wilds. Nay, returning to his native coun- I
try, he finds many who have increased their <
stores as rapidly as himself, and some even |
who appear to have outstripped him in the 11
race. He is surprised, if not mortified, and I
regrets the happiness he has thrown away, i
in the vain expectation of realizing a brilliant
fortune. Others who emigrate, finding that
in a new country credit is boundless, soon I
get into their hands a large property. They
open new plantations, build fine houses, set
up in magnificent style; half the world regards
them as magnificentlv wealthy, and
they are firmly convinced of it themselves-r
until at last the bubble bursts-elands, ne.
groes, houses, furniture and equipage, all
vanish, and they have the glory of being
fiorp* rn'7!?on<i yet in arrears. Such splen.
lid effigies of wealth like these delude thd

Let all those who are looking toward the
.Vest reflect maturely on what they do. If.
hey are not satisfied with these views, (if
hey shuold chance to See them^ let then)
nquire for themselves, and obtain their own
lata?but reduce every thing to the minute
calculations which I have suggested.
Let no planters in this State, whatever
nay have been his success heretofore, de*
ipairof making at least 1*250 lbs. of clean
oiton to the hand. It can be done on al*
nost any land in the State?he has only to
ook into this business himself, and know
hat it is properly managed. Let him open
it once a double quantity of land so a* to
hift every year, or every other year, at
uits it best. Let him plant at least ten e7
res to the hand, besides provisions?let
tim, in order to tend it, get half as many
nules as lie has hands, so as to run that
nany ploughs, when necesiary, and if he ha$

icud scarcely feed his mules on corn when
die?let him plant in rows from $ 1-j to
11-2 feet wide, according to the dtr&igth of
he soil and if his land is light, tend it With
i scraper; if stiff, with the side harrows now
n successfuPoperation in the neighborhood
>f Augusta, Georgia, and other parts of this
Stale, either of which will generally plough
iuI a row at two furrows. Let him do
hese things, and plant early, and push his
totton from the start* and I will inlure him
hut he can not only tend ten, but twelve to
ourteen acres of cotton, and make not only
[250 lbs. but 15 and 1800 lbs. of ginned
lotton to the hand, on a large portion of the
ands in Cur State* which may now lje had
it the rates I have specified above.
I have written you, Mr. Editor, a rtiudty
onger article than 1 had any idea of
'oing, and yet there are some parts thai
have not touched, and others merely
;lanccd at, while perhaps I may be accos^
id of some digressions which haveconsum,
id valuable space. 1 send, you, however
he article, such as it is, and if thy remarks
ihall induce any one of your readers to be*
ieve that our own la&d, if It is not (as t
jincerely brlieve it ie) " of every land the
wide," it is, at all events, not veiy much
ess favored than some others ; and that if
leithcr the ties of birth, of kindred* nor of
friends, nor of country, can fix him here, it
s, to say the least, doubtful whether his
interest will be much advanced by leaving
is, my pams will be fully compensated.
A PINE LAND PLANTER,
Portable manures.
Tills is a term given in Er^Iand to what
ffe call contracted, manures, that is, bone
lust, horn shavings, and poudrette, urette,
Sic. They are probably there called porta*
hie, for the reason, that they may be tran*
sported a distance of one.tenth or) i-$0ib
of the expense that their equivalent of sta*
bio manure could be transported. Hence
they are in great demand, in Qre&uBri*
am ; and the quantity used may be judged
3f from the fact, that that country is now
raying annually, ?200,000 to foreign coun,
riea, equal to $888,000 for bones to fertilize
icr lands ; while the high price of the aside
has led to the most careful collection of
hem in every part of the United Kingdom,
In 1627, Mr. Huskinson gave it as his op.
nion, in the House of Commons, that the
ise of bone dust, in British husbandry, oc.
:asioned an additional produce of 500,000
quarters of corn, (four millions of bushels,)
ind the writer in the Irish Farmers's Mag#
izine, who states the facts we are narrating,
idds," it is not too much to suppose, that
he quantity has since been increased four
'old ; that is, that the use of bone dust in
British husbandry is now annually adding
iixteen millions of bushels of grain to her
agricultural products ! What a lesson this
for our farmers, who are exhausting the
patrimony which Provideuce gave for comf
ing generations!
" The most active ingredients in bone
Just," says the writer to whom we refer,
are phosphoric acid and ammonia, com#
bined with lime and carbon ; and it is to the
iction of these upon each other* and theio*
3 uc rices of the changes of the atmosphere*
and of sun shine and raiu, in producing and
maintaining that action, both above and u)
[he ground, that is to be attributed the extraordinary
results attending the application
of bone dust."
The writer than proceeds to say, thai f
portable manure may be prepared, very easr.
[y, and at little expense, in every farm
yard, which shall contain the. element*
which enrich and stimulate the sod to the
highest pitch of fertility. The ingredient*
he recommeuds, and the proportions pleach*
are as follows 1 ton of turf or peat dust,
[if ashes the better,) 1 cwt. soot, 1 cwt.
zommon salr, 1 cwt, quicklime reduced to
powder, 14 lbs. East India saltpetre, (nit.
rate of potash.) The ashes, soot and lime
to be well mixed together. The sak and
salt petre to be dissolved in urine, as it may
he required to saturate and keep moist the
heap. After the salts are expended, the ti*
rine to be continued?and new ashes tob*
spread on the top to intercept the vapors.
Such a composlion, he says, cap be formed
for 20s. a ton. which would bo more effi.
cacious than 40 bushels bone dust, costing
60s. or fifteen cords of yard dang, and might
be transported at a single load. The in?
gradients in the mass supply all the ete*
ments for which decayed Vegetable end hot*
mal substances are used, such as alkali god
