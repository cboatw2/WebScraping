contains a letter from their correspondeut in
Jacksonville, E. F., relative to die stte of the
inhabitants, weather, &c., fromt which we ex.
tract the following:
"We have had. for the past f1ew days. the
most driving and drenching rains, I ever wit
.nessed or read of. The drops have fani' so
thick and fast, that the extended hatad could not
be seen. and the distance appeared like ar im

ask of solving the problem how we in our low,

play of Providence, which is only attributed -t

.conelude without relating a melancholy occur

neighborhoodof Alligator.

that uniess when it ati'ords undoubted evi
aence of a general forwardness of the crop,
it leads to very pernicious results, and that
on the present occasion, it would be the
part of wisdom and prudence with the
Planters, to rfrain from this unprofitable
rivalry. The growing crop. is unlues
tion'ably, very backward, and though a
