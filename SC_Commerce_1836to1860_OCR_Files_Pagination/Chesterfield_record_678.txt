CURIOUS MEDICAL WARFARE. |
A FUNNY MATTER.
A case was tried in the Ju>tices' couit
nt Harlem, New-York, on the 11th inst.
which is too interesting to pass unnoticed.
It seems that Harlem has two physicians,
Dr. Mulnerand Dr. Holme, who of course
love each other exceedingly. Dr. IK line,
having recently established h;in>elf there,
was regarded by the other as trespassing
upon his manor, and Dr. Mulner had
* 0f cneak
therefore, lost no nppm iuhu?
ing in terms not the most Haltering, e?fj
his brother in physic. Among other
things he had said that Dr. II. was not a
regular physician, and could not collect
his bill by law. This suit was brought
by Dr. H. to prove that he could ; for it
seeins that Mulner had once asked him to
a consultation for the purpose of quizzing
and abusing hicn. High words passed
between them on the spot, and lleline
presented his hill of $5 as his consultation
fee, and demanded payment, which
was refused. Each parly was his own
coonsel.
Dr. J. S. Oatman, a physician of this
city, was first summoned as a witness.
He testified to the authenticity of the
diploma and other documents presented
by Dr. Helme, and in answer to a question
by Dr. Mulner, said that he had
known several cases in which one physician
had charged another for professional
services.
Mulner, (highly excited.)?Name one
sir, if you can.
Oal man. ? I once kn**\v a case which
occurred in a small town in Massachusetts.
An old phys.cian had .for several years
been brow beating a younger one in the
tow n, and one day sent for him to come
and hold a consultation at the house of
bis neighbor. The young physcian arrived
; and the elder one pointed to a
large dog which was standing in the room,
and said. 'there, sir, you see the tail of
that dog curls most beautifully over his
back forming a perfect circle. Now, 1
want you to straighten that dog's tail,
?nd when you have done so effectually,
] will give you credit for more surgical
.knowledge than I now believe vou to petssofs."
The'young physician at once
look out his instruments,secured the dog.
cut and gashed his tail, ami pinded it between
splinters and bandages, and left the
house. The" next day he called a: d
found the bandages had been removed,
but he immediately replaced them. He
called eight successive days with the
same result. On the 9th day, he found
upon calling, that the dog was not at
home; so taking it for granted that his tail
had been straightened, he discontinued
bis visits, and presented his hill for $90,
[$10 a visit] to the senior physician. Payment
was refused and a suit brought.
The case was in a count) court, and the
oldgentleman, upon consulting legal coun?oh
ascertained that he was liable for the
debt, and he paid the ninety dollars in
hard money before the case came to trial,
{[(oars of laughter by the whole audience
in which the Judge was obliged to join.?]
1)/. Aiulner.? That case, sir, however
funny you may conceive it, w wot to the
point.
Dr. Oatmnn.?I think I remember a
**ase which may he considered parallel to
f this now on trial.
Dr. MaJner ?Relate it sir.
Dr. Oatman.?A learned nnJ talented
{physician moved into a town in New
Hampshire and ulhthe resident physicians
avt once joined in common war against
ihim, 'J'hey tried every .plan to taring him
to disrepute, and finally invited him to
deliver before them a course of lectures
<on anatomy, informing him at the sanw?
trine that thev had a subject ready for him.
He complied with their request and on the
day named he appeared in their loelurc
room. He found the dissecting tables
arranged; and the subject covered over
*v?ll? white muslin. On removing the
cover, tiie subject was found to ho a huge
ihull frog. The lecturer exhibited no
signs of surprise, hut after gravely cx4imirwng
his subject lie produced his sealpel
and commenced dissecting it. He
-commenced a lecture iij>on comparative
anatomy: and soon convinced his auditors
that they had woke up the wrong passenger.
They soon became charmed with
Ike admirable manner in which he handled
his subject, and when, alter speaking
nearly an hour, he announced that his
a text lecture on the same subject would
;takc place on the following evening, he
Wasgreoted with applause, lie delivered
five lectures, with lienor to himself and
^satisfaction to his hearers. Then came
'the sequel. lie presented his hill of ?10
a-ach, against all who invited him to Ico lurc
Itoforc them. They would not pay,
'and he sued them. The cause was tried,
and the court awarded him the amount
of his claim.
The Judge, in the present case, look two
(or three days to consider, and then ren
dered a verdict of $3 and cost, in al! -SI 1
'for plaintiff. Hereafter Dr. Mulncr will
nrohablv count the cost before lie at

{p!rysicians.

Agriculture is the foundation of all human
arts?the art for which man was made, and
the perfection of which is bis chief happiness !
j and glory as the lord temporal of this planet* j
' Of this sublime art, all other arts and sciences I
i are but satellites, their business being to wait 1
cn, enlighten, and adorn it with their moon- I
! 6hine. Consequently no man more than the I
| agriculturist needs the full use of his brains,
I and a perfect command of all the treasures of
human experience. So the fanners of the
| United States view the matter; and in pre?- ?'imr
tiiem with a translation of the cele.
w" & ----- t
j bra ted Maison Rustique, of I he French* %re
| have no doubt of their hearty support. It ic
I the work of aJI works on jtraciical agriculture
| ?the most scientific. clear, and cc mpreheii.
i sive, France has long excelled in profUaMe
| farming. This is the source of her wea'th.
j England is rich by coals and commerce. Her
! agriculture is splendid, but 60inet?me? costs
| more than it comes to. Those who have
! fortunes to $j)end may buy the vast works of
I Marsha'I, Dickson Arthur Young, Loudon, j
&.C., but those who wish to gel a forUme out
of the soil will find the fVencli writers better
| able to show them the way. The excellence
i -et French elementary works is well known to
j ah teachers. For centuries, the iWaibon
| Rustique has been, in France, the standard
elementary work?the spelling book and
grammar of lanning. The present edition for
" the nineteenth cuotwy," has be.^n re'-vfrfi- '
ten and brought up with the " march of mind,*' j
by sixty of the ablest "agronoines*' of France.
It has all the light of the latest improvements, |

5ih!y. To enable gentlemen of the
Law to become well acquainted with the
nature of those patent schemes which are
so apt to give rise to litigation.
6thly. To present to Legislators such
a char exposition of the staple manufac*
tures, as may dissuade them from enact*
|ing laws, which obstruct industry, or
cherish one b'unch of it, to the injury of
many others.
