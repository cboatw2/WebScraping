44 \\ hen til*- air is apparently s'ngnnnt
in M? valley of ;he Thames and surrounding
ountry, a s'rong current is found to s? t
in, or every side of London along the
6 r ets lead ng from the coun ry in the morning.
Tins curr? nt is no douut occasioned
by 'he rarefaci on n tne high clumneys,
over so many thousand fires just kindled,
and must be the cause of the introduction
of fresh air to an immense extent, which
would not others is* flow. This ran faction
produces other piicnnnrvna, among, which
when the atmospheit* is in a light state,
and clouds are passing at a height which
does not allow them to condense and fall in
rain,these accumulate h, passing o?er London,
and ei her remain as a d nse log, <-r :
drop in small rain al day long, scarcely j
clearing once ; the country at a little distance
having very little rain."
The bad philosophy of supposing the air
so I gl?t on these occasions as to let the
clouds) on passing* sink down in it over ;
London, does not invalidate the evidence of
the principle fact.
From these remarkable faefs alone I j
think it will be acknowledged that tnere is j
some connection between great tires and |
rains other than mere coincidence, even it j
that connection remained a mystery. Hum- j
boldt acknowledged this in the case of Vol- j
canoes when he speaks of the mysterious \
connection between Volcanoes and rain,!
and says that when a Volcanoe bursts out j
in South American in a dry season, it some- |
times changes it to a rainy one. But now j
when it is demonstrated by the most decisive
evidence, the evidence of experiment, that j
air in ascending the into the atmosphere in j
a column, as it must do over a great fire,,
will cool bv diminished pressure, so much j
I that it will begin to condense its vapour into j
cloud as soon as it shall rise about as man}' I
hundred yards as the temperature of the air
is above the dew-point in degresofFahrenheit,
it amounts to a very high probability
that great fires have sometimes produced
rain. That great fires and even volcanoes
should not always produce rain is maniiest:
from the circumstance that as they break i
out accidentia, ihev may sometimes occur
when the state of the atmosphere is un'a
vorable and even adverse to rain. First,
if they should break out when there is a current
of air, either near the surface of the
earth, or at a considerable distance above,
of some strength, the up-moving column
would be swept by it, out of the perp'*n licitJar,
before s. cloud of great density cou! J be
Tormed, and thus rain would be prevented.
Fecond, they might break out when the* 1 i
dew-point was too low to produce rain at J
a!! ; and. thirJ, there may sennet mes bo an
upper stratum of air, containing so much j
calorie that its specific le*. ity would prevent J
l!;o uprnovmg column from rising into ii far j
enough to cause rain.
These :!i! ceilings I conceive are the only
circumstances which prevent great fires
from producing rain at all linn s when they |
occur, The fir>t two can be asccrtai led j

Leg slature will promise a sufficient reward '
in case of success. |
I: lias been objected to my project that 1 j
propose too much, and that u is u'terly ab i
surd to expect to make rain in t tnu of;
drought, when there is such a scan i y of j
vapour in ;he air.
Now this objection is founded on an entire
ignorance of the fact arts ng from n want
of due consideration. For there !? generalty
more vapour in the lime of summer
than at any other time, as I know by ex- |
perimenl.s constantly madealmos ? very day |
for these last years ; and 'his is reasona- j

preparing for another rain. A quiet stau- '
of the atioosphcrc is also more likely to oc- j
c ir, to great heights, in time of droughts
than at any other time, for immediately aftcr
rains there are sure to he cross currents
ol air, produced by the inward motion of the
air at the lower part of the cloud and an
outward motion in the upper pan, which re
q i re some time after the rain to come to j
rest.
If] have succeeded in showing that there
is any the least ground to hope that nn
tempt to producce ram, might sometimes
succeed under favorable circumstances,
nnd that those favourable circumstances
are likely to occur in time of drought than

1 have many reasons and facts which in

that tuis w.ll not be the case, when it is no

power which can b"C deuluted wipi as much

their transverse diameter lies, and whether
they move side foremost or end foremost or

O.N THE PROBABLE DURATION OF HUMAN >
LIFE. n
Dr. Casper, of Berlin, in his valuable ,
vork, enti led "Der Wahrscheinlichr .

ifter having examined iho current opinions n
is to tne average duration of human life,
jnd as to the most satisfactory method of 0
iscertaining such a result, announces his 0

The proportion ol births of the population P
n any place expresses almost exactly the ''
ncdium or average duration of life there."
For example, suppose 'hat thispropor ion ^
s in the ratio of 1 to 38, then the averag
I*'
ifo of the inhabittinis of the place wnj be
ound to be 38 years.
If this rule he correct, it must follow that ^
he duration of life increases and dinr inishes
c
n a population according as their lecundity
s greater or less ; so that man, it not as

P
nass, may be said to have il m his power n
o lengthen or abridge his life.
This, if true, is indeed a proposition of
>reat importance in political economy.
To prove that the mortality is in a direct |j
atio with the fecundity of any population
md, consequently, that governments, seeing |(
hat the force of states consists not so much
>n the mere number, as on the strength,
ecundity. and longevity of their inhabitants
>ughi not to favor or encourage an overibundnnt
population, the author has colected
a vast number of facts, and for this j?
>urpose has drawn up tables of the mortaly,
not only in Prussia, but also in Britain,
France, and Belgium.
From these researches he comes to the
;onclusion that every where the morality ..
s direcdy proport.onal to the fecundity of *
he popubition.
This doctrine, if confirmed by future in- l(
juiries, may, to a certain extent, reconcile u
he opinions of Malthus and his opponents, 6
is it shows as the Nature herself tends to ?
emedy the evil of a redundant populi* lr
ion.
Dr. Casper gives a valuable table of the P
nortality ?n Berlin for twelve years, from P
1817 to 1829. which comprses nearly sl
rO.UOl) deaths 2,000.000 inhabitants. I1
The following are a ft w interesting data ,r
which are derivable from his researches : w
The longevity of the female is greater P
han that of the male sex. 0
The age of puberty carries ofF 8 per r<
:entura more of the female than of the male ^
<1
tex.
The proportion of deaths of women in "
abor is 1 in 108.
It has been :?n erroneous, although l,\:h. l<
;rto a very prevaent nation, that the cK- ^
nacterie ago of a woman has a marked sl
nfluence increasing the mortality of the ?
cmale sex. 0
This opinion has been shown to be in- w
- L-. ~"i oi"iI otutvi-n prs. and If
jorreci u) ....
he researches of Dr. Casper confirm the e
iccuracy of their statements. On the V
vhole, therefore, we may assert that the u
ongevity ofth<- female is greater than that
>f the male sex. G
It is also worthy of notice that of s ill* P
jorn infants there are more ol the male than tc
>f tiie female sex. tt
Dr. Casper proceeds to show that the te
nodium or average duration of life has ti
ncrcaswl considerably in most European 01
aticsoflate years. In London this increase le
s great, for it w ould s .eni that, within the bi
ist century, probable life has increased by nr
wenty years. JAt
Geneva, ngui.o, in the ICih century, g<
no.half of the infant? horn thorn di?*d, we' D
re told, before their fifth year; wherus, in
le present day, it wc.uld appear that this
alf retches nearly 43 years of age. A
miter remark may be made as to the inre?
s d length of life at Berlin.
Dr. Casper treats pretty fully on the in.
ueneo of pursuits and occupations on the
ur t m of human life; and frewn his innines
it appears that "clergymen are, on

mil known. Dr. Casper gives some tables
f mortality which prove the sad con'rast
i his lesjKJCt between the poor and nfRu
iv. From these it would seem that the
oedium age of the nobility in-Ge. many may
ie stated at about 50 years, whereas thato1
ae paupers is as low as 32 yeais.
The last chapter of lie work treats of tan
t flue nee of th" fecundity of a population
pon its mortali'y. Dr Casper shows, by
vast number of documen s, that "the
aortality in any population is always in
,?tio to its fecundity," or, in other words,
die mote prol flc the people is, the greater,
sually, is the mortality .among them."
H alludes to the differen r, in this repect,
in ti?e different d siricts in England ;
nd maintains that wherever the number ol
irths is highest, there the mortality is greatst
at the same time.
The same result is derivable from s'a isleal
investigaton ia Helgium, Franc*,and
tber countries.
Dr. Casper concludes his work by emodying
the genera! principles of his reearth
-s in the following conclusions :
1. Tne proportion of births to the actuI
stationary population of any place
xpresses, or is relative to, the medium
uraiion oflifo in that population.
2. Tiie femal! sex enjoys, at every
eriod of life, except at puherty, at which
poch th ! mortality is rather greater among
oung females, a greater longevity than the
wile sex.
3. Pregnancy and labor occasion, in
e< d,a considerable loss of life; but this
tiss disappears or is lost in the gent ral
aass.
4. The so called climacteric periods
f life d) not s? em Jo have any influence
n the longevity of either sex.
5. Tne mnd urn duration of life, at the >
esent time, is in Russia about 21 years
i Prussi i 2'J, in Swi z?rlund 34. in France

ars.
6. Tiie medium duration of life has, in
eccnt times, increased very greatly in
iiost cities in Europe.
7. In reference to the influence of pro ssions
or occupa ions on life, it seems that
cclesislics are, on the whole, the longest,
nd medical men are the shortest livers;
lilitary men arc nearly between the two
xtremes, but y t, proportionally, they,
lore frequently than otiiers, reach very

LIFE IN MISSISSIPPI.
From the New Orleans, Picayune, May 23.]

Imust lorce the conviction on our mind that

Those prefaratory remarks have suggrsid
themselves on p? r.sumg in the Natchez
,'oum r of the 20th in.st. an account ol two
treet fig ts, one ofwhich proved fual to one
f the parses eng .ged, ?ind is headed,4 Anther
offray and death," as if such scenes
ere of an ev? ry day occurrence, or it least
nitating their Irequency. Toe unfortunate
vent took place in the town of Woolvlle,
Wilkinson county, lust week. The partic!ars
are these :
Mr. A. J. Foster, the foreman of the
rrand Jury, made himself active in that ca
acity to render cer. a in persons amenable
? the law who had been parties to a conuupiateddael.
He sometimes after visi.
id the office of Mr. Leigh, one ofihe pares,
who called him an informer, and applied
iher insulting epithets to him. A chal.
mge ensued and a duel was decideJ on ;
tit before the appointed time Mr. Leigh
let Mr. C. Foster, a younger bro iler of A.
Foster. Insulting language ensued, and a
eneral fight was the consequence, in which
(r. Moresse, C. Foster, Mr. Leigh, Mr.
Fielding Dtvis, Judge Smith and one or two
others were 'engaged. Mr. Leigbi w'10
hnd received some peisonal injury from Mr.
D.ivis, sent him a challenge by Mr. F. A.
Moore. Moore and Davis, now quarrelled,
Davis struck'the former with a whip, injur.
ing him severely Mr. Davis shortly after
proceeded to the Post Office; Mr. Leigh
walked immediately after him with a drawn
knile or dirk in his hand. Mr. D. saw him
as he advanced, and told him not to op*
proach him. Mr. L. continued to do "so,
Mr. D. repented his warning, and told him
if he did so he would shool him ; and seeing
that Mr. Leigh did no', stop, he raised a
double, barr lied gun which he had ?'n his
hand and snapp'-d both barrels at him, nei.
tiier of which went off. He ihenairuck hun
wi h the end of ihe gun and knocked him
down, and then rctrea ed across the Street.
Mr. Leigh after rising continued to .advance,

L igh, after lingenng near two days, died
of the wound. D vis was immediately ?r.

ted to bail in the sum of $15,000.
The less lamentable afftir to wh'ch we
have ad erted occured at Jackson, Miss.,
on the 15;tiinst. I. appears that Gov. McNuit
was contemptuously spit upon by R.
L. Dixon, the clerk of the Chancery Court,
some tew weeks since, and that one A. J.
Puxton thought it to b<* his duty in the public
papers to wipe off the a ain. This was
the origin of the affur, and here is the sequel
as given in the Na ch?*z Courier. It is an
extract from a lettc; dated Jackson, 16.h
May. We would wish to abridge it, but
th re is such a cha n of circumstances that
we ennno well do so. Tne writer says :
On yesterdax, R. L. Dixon, the clerk of
the C raticery Court, attacked A. J. P.txton
in the Rotunda of the C.pitol, and gave
ium a very severe caning, tor and on ac?
count of a publication of Fax on's which
appeared in the Missippi ?n of the 3d inst.
Judge MeKiuley of the U. S. Court, ( hen
in session in the capi'oi, find Dixon $500
contempt of court. In the evening M%
PrtX'on and his friends, about twenty in
number, prepared, for an attach on D xonp
by arming themselves with gunsaud pistols,
and placed tfemslvs in a ouse hy which
D. was most sure to pass in going to his
office. D. hearing of this, prepared himself
for defence by taking his stand in the street,
where he stood for half an hour, when P.
sent him a challenge, which D. would not accept,
assigned as his reasons, that lie had
a lucrative office, and should be accept a
cba Jong", lie would lose it, and by the lawbe
debarred from the privilege of ever again
holding nn office in the S ate. Paxton thea
came out and commenced advancing on
Dixon, who told him that if he ndvanccd
tur her it would be at the risk of bis life, at
which P. stopped and denounced D. and
and then retired, when the crowd almost
simult neous shouted * Hurrah for Dixon.'*
?Here the matter of yesterday seems likely
to s op.
Bat this evening the oi l Parsh Judgo
McKinlcy, of the U S. Court, after adjourning
court, and whilst on his way to his
i _ J i ai i
room, i?aa ins nose punec* severely, oy a
Mr. James II. B'?yd, a young man who had
been acting as officer of the court during
the iiforesaid affray between D., and P.,
and for not in <rfcring was call' a " a stupid
Jackass" by Judge McKnley, for which
be had hi* smeller pulled, &c. &c. He
(Boyd) is justified by ev? ry one whom I
tiave b- ard speak of the matter, and will
be sustained."
The 44 Hurah for Dixon" g"'.*on above,
shows pret y plainly the false feeling of
courage which prevails in Mississippi ; and
nil it is boob down by the irres snble voice
of public opinion, a better state of tilings
may by looked for tin vair. So long as a *
man is visied wi h publ c op pro hi urn, for
not engaging in an affair of blood, all laws
onacted for ihe prevention of such scene
w ill he nugaory and unuva ling. A radical
reform is needed. May we look out for its
advent ? The sight of bis native shore
could not more gladden the heart of the ship,
wrecked mariner, than would the arrival of
such an epoch crea e in the bosoms of all
who love the consti;ulion.--advocate the
m ijesty of the laws, and are friends of general
order.
33* It appears from another account that
Boyd did not pull the judge's nose, but shook
his fis in his face. Boyd is represented to be
a poke easy sort of creature, not very likely to
shake his fist where there would be any probability
of a counter shaking of fists.
