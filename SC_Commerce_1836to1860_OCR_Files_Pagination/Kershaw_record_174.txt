-PATENT COTTON (UN.
*5 HIS Gin can be made double, or single. If
p made double, they reduce labor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other kpd having been in use prevous
to this patent; ana whether single or double, they
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from xO to 100 saws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will be sufficient to attend
them. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to them, which free the cotton
trom leaves, trash, dirt, See. before it can reach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a halfi
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a i
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of'
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
whieh the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the
laws are placed oh two sets of cylinders and turn
jpon each other in opposite directions, bind are
neansed by two sets of brushes that have fouirrevoutions
to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
>e detached so as to enable the planter to run one
ur both at pleasure, althougli embraced with feeders,
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
vith a drum hnd band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
nay be propelled by horse, steam, or water power,
it may also be propelled bv iron iHrn firnrr rrna? I
r? . "6 6V"1 *
1'ho force required to work it, is about tlie same as
hat necessary to move an equal number of saws in
lie common Gih. .This Gin has been put in
>peratiou in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
md its success tested in the presence of a large
lumber of plantors, merchant* arid others, and
eceivetl their general approbation.
Several gentlemen haVe be eta so kind as to give
he Patentee their written opinion respecting the
neritsof the Gin. A number of others could be
idded, but the following are deemed sufficient:
from his Excellency Gov. White of Louisiana.
New Grletfns, Feb. 27,1837.
Dr. A. Jones?Sir, In reply to your enquiry,
vhat I think of yonr improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
o say, that I saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst.
ind was very much pleased with its performance.
The mere faot of its self-feeding, seems to me to
?e & very valuable improvement; and besides, the

appeared to me to be better and oleaner than

From Mr. G. Senior, a Machinist of New Orleans.
Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in ansuei tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your l'atent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that 1 was lillcen years engaged
in the cOtton factories of Manchester, England,
and during four years of that lime, 1 was
foreman in the house of Messrs. I.ewis, Williams
A Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. Sondford & Greene. I have seen your
Cotton 'Gin in operation, and have examined the
"cotton ginned by it, and pronounce it belter cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under'my observation. It is completely
ready lor the breaker without the aid of the
blower, and would, therefore, save the first process
in niai!urai>iu?i..f, nrtirlp. 1 consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin, would ccimnuiiu ?v...
to two Cents on the pound more than the average
crops brought into the Manchester market, and
cleansed by cOnnnon Gins. Yours, very jesp'ly.

The Gins ordered will be delivered to the agents,
of planters in any of the sea port towns of the cotton
planting Slates, at the above prices, the agents
paying the freight on the same from New York,
and becoming responsible for !hc amount of the Gin.
It is desirable, when planters give orders'for Gins,
they should accompany thorn with their views in
regard to the arrangement of saws, breasts, brushes,
Ac. It is found they difler in opinion. Pome
desire saws of larger diameter than others. The
most common sizoisO or JO inches; but some wish
them J2 inches. Some wish 5 or 0 rows of brushes
on an axle, while others do not want more thnn 4
at moat. Some wish saws with 8 or 9 teeth to the
inch, while others want 10 or 11. With so much
discrepancy, we prefer they should, at the time of
giving orders, furnish a statement of their wishes,
and tne manufacturerers can fulfil them in every
particular. Where it is left to our discretion, wo
Bhall make them on the most modern and approved
plan. An order can be executed, from the lime it
is received, in the space of eight or nine weeks
and the Oin in that time plae.ed in the handaof the
factor. To be in time for the next crop, all orders
ought to be in the hands of the manufacturers by
the first or middle of May; except for plantations
where they are late in commencing to pick or gin m
3otton.
