PROSPECTUS 1
OF THE
Camden Commercial Courier. ]
THE Establishment of the COMMERCIAL <
COURIER was rendered necessary by the incon- I
venience to which our citizens have been subjected
for the want of a public channel of communication <
which in a commercial community like Camden, is <
essentially necessary, and consequently the COU- ?
RIER'S claim on the public is such as should en- <
sure a liberal patronage. J
The undersigned have spared no trouble or expense
in obtaining the best workmen in order to >
render the Paper nil the advantages that it will '

In polilical matters the Courier will take no 1
part; the design being to publish a Paper adapted <
to the interest of all, which could not be effected
by its entering into the arena of Politics?it will '
be confined principally to such matter as appertains
to Commerce, Agriculture and Amusement.
The COURIER is published every Saturday '
morning at Three Dollars in advance, or Four

THE subscriber informs the public, that he has
just completed the mixture of this valuable me1
i dictne. He takes pleasure In stating that he has
made use of this PANACEA, successfully in a ease
i! of Scrofula, which he has been afflicted with tnnro
than three years. On several occasions he appHed
' to practical Physicians for aid, (North and South,)
1 and received no benefit. He was, at length, pie.
vail*?l unnn by numerous acquaintances, to try the
, virtue oY certain ROOTS and HERBS; and bo.,
lieving, that the Receipt would greatly benefit him, ]
he took it, together with an obi French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper here to sav, that the quality of some,
or am. the principal Roots, are well known to the
Medical .Faculty, by whom they are frequently used.
?For Scrofula or King's Evil, Ulcerated Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOD, or the effects of
Mercury ; it has a decided salutary effect..
For Bowei. Complaint he would also recommend
the use of the VEGETABLE PANACEA. Children
are frequently attacked with this complaint:
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they become regular
again. It has been tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
cure." He has tried it at difierent times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
i ins iviemciue is simple in its operations; and has
a pleasant taste.
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.
The subscriber will keep a constant supply of the
Panacea at the different Drug Stores throughout
the United States. Orders addressed to the subscriber,
or to James R. M'Kain, will he promptly attended
to. The PANACEA may always be had at

THE success of the SOUTHERN TONIC is
unprecedented, it has neon anxiously sought
after by all persons in every part of ihe United
States, and its widely extended distribution has
been owing to the many requests received from
every section of the South and South West. Although
it originated in ao obscure p >rt of the country
but a few years since, it is now found in all the
principal towns and villages in the Union, and its
virtues as a cure for Ague and Fever, and as a
general Tonic, are apprec.ated by all who have
used it Reino- as it professes a compound of
Southern Vegetables, it is needless to otter 'lie assurance
that there is no A rsenic,Mercury, nor any
thing in the least hurtful to the human eoustituI
tion in it. It will be found a valuable Medic.ne
in all cases of Dyspepsia and disorganised Stomach
; and Rowelsl and patients convalescing from I illious
Fever, will derive the most important benefits
from the use of the Southern Tonic. It may
be administered to rlnldren and infants of the most
tender age with the utmost safely. Prepared by j

PATENT COTTON CilN. I
rB'.IIIS Gin can be made double, or single. If (
w made double, they reduce labor, and gin just J
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylinder
Gin, no other knd having been in use prevous
10 mis patent; ana wiieilier single or double, they
?ire found to improve the quality of the cotton, by '
more perfectly cleaning it. They can be made to
contain from 520 to IGOsawsina stand, and whether
small or large, one hand will bo sufficient to attend
thein. The Gins have mechanical feeders and
hoppers attached to thein, which free the cotton
from leaves, trash, dirt, &c. before it can teach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revo- ]
lotions to one of the saws, it is almost in a half j
gined slate, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gnates, on which the hoppers rest, and through j
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can be
made to feed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at the time. When made double, the ,
saws arc placed on two sets of cylinders and turn
upon each other in opposite directions, and are j
cleansed by two sets of brushes that have four revolutions
to one of two saw. The two cylinders can
I be detnehed so as to enable the planter to run one ,
J or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders. J

It may also be propelled by iron running gear. ! j
I The lorce required to work it, is about the same as
I that necessary to move an qual number of saws in 1 ,
the common Gin. Tilts Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans for two or three weeks,
I and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation.
Several gentlemen have been so kind as to give 1
the Patentee their written opinion tespecting the *
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, but the following are deemed sufficient: 1

what I think of your improved Cotton Gin, 1 have
to say, that I saw it work on Saturday the 25th inst. 1
and was very much pleased with its performance. r
The mere fact of its self-feeding, seems to ine to f.
be a very valuable improvement; and besides, the 1
quality of the cotton, as it comes out of the pro- 1
cess, appeared to me to be better and clenner than
from the common Gins in use, and that it saves c
considerably in labor. Respectfully, A:c. 0

Dr. A. Jones?Dear Sir, in nnswei tc your inquiry
of my opinion of your l'atent Cotton Gin, I
beg leave to state, that I was fifteen years engaged
in the cotton factories of Manchester, Englund,
und during four years of that time, 1 wu3
foremen in the house of Messrs. Lewis, Williams
A Co.-, and near five years spinner in the house of
Messrs. bandfurd A' Gr-enr. 1 have seen your
Cotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
cotton ginned by it, and pronounce tt better cleansed,
and the staple less injured, than any cotton
that ever came under my observation. It is completely
reai:y lor the break* r without the aid of the
blower, and w ould, thrrelore, save the first proecs3
in manufacturing the article I consider cotton
cleansed by your Gin. would command from one
to two cents on the pound more than the average
ciops brought into the Manchester market, ami
cleansed by common Gins Yours, very resp'ly.
