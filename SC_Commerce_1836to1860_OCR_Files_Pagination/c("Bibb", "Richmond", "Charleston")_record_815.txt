MY BROTHER.
It is no fearftd dream of the night
That my brother hath paat from the world away,
That his eyea have lost their living light,
And his heart ia turned to unconscious clay;
For we miss him at morn when the lark first sings
Her matins sweet to the opening day,—
We miss him at eve when the soit breeze brings
Lone Philomel’s strain to the twilight gray—
We miss him at noon in the breezy hall,
And at night, with the young round the lighted hearth;
For he was the gayest of them all,
And his was the brightest smile of mirth.
Fresh glow’d his cheek in its early bloom,
And pure was the light of his fair young brow;
But O, like the flower, ’mid its young perfume,
He withered; and where is my brother now 1
Go and inquire of the voiceless tomb,—
There cold is the clay that pillows his head,
• And drear is the night which, in lasting gloom,
Is hovering around his lowly bed.
Ah l why did ho pass so soon away
From this joyous earth *o a world unknown 1
Why faded his light of life ere the ray
Of his dawning genius brightly shone 1
Alas 1 he sleeps in the narrow bed
Whose early dreams are of deathless fame,
And soon shall a cold oblivion spread
A fearful shadow around his name.
But I, ere then, with my brother shall rest
In a purer clime, o’er these regions of night—
I know he is there with the happy and blest,
Who dwell in the realms of immortal light.
For soft was the sigh of his parting breath,
Unearthly the triumph that thrill’d his breast,
And serenely sweet sat the smile of death
On his hueless lips when he sunk to rest.

For Iho Southern Chrieltnn Advocate.
. It is our melancholy duty to announce the unex
pected and untimely death of Mr. Edward W.
Collier, long known as a worthy and respectable
citizen of Augusta, Ga. Ho fell by the steel of an
assassin,—the unsuspecting victim of a reckless,
soulless murderer, whose history reports him to
have been accustomed to blows and bloodshed.—
Brother Collier was the proprietor of the Rich
mond Hotel in this city, and had gone down to the
Georgia Rail-Road Depot, on the morning of the
8th inBtant, to conduct to his house any passen
gers who might be inclined to accompany him.—
He had set out on foot for home, attended by two
gentlemen (one of them an old acquaintance,)
when they were followed by the unwarrantable and
provoking interference of Robert Burns, a runner
and agent for the United States Hotel. A brief
altercation ensued, when the weaponless, defence
less Collier, was pierced to the heart by repeated
•tabs from the merciless blade of Burns. lie tell,
and almost instantly expired. Three gashes in the
left breast, one in the abdomen, and one ou the
knee, were found on inspecting Ids body.
The murderer escaped, and though public indig
nation was highly excited, and every vigilance has
been employed on the part of the police and popu
lace, he has not yet been apprehended.
Brother Collier had long sustained the reputation
of an active, cnterprizing, and industrious citizen;
respected for his integrity and honesty, and char
acterized by a peaceable deportment and benevo
lent disposition, and ever actuated by that high
sense of honour and scrupulous regard for the
feelings and rights of others, which mark the in
tercourse of the gentleman and Christian. Al
though destined, himself, to feel the reverses of
fortune, his warm and geuerous heart never repul
sed the claims of the suffering and indigent, when
he could control the means of relief. His name
will long be cherished in lively remembrance by
many who have been the beneficiaries of his kind
ness, and now delight to speak of wrhat his noise
less charity, during life, had forborne to proclaim.
He was born in Columbia county, Ga.,—had reach
ed his fiftieth year, and for more than sixteen years
past, had been a member of the Methodist Epis
copaWChurch ; and although at one time, amid tho
embarrassments of business, and the pressure of
misfortunes, he had suffered an acknowledged de
clensiou in iiis religious condition, yet he never
quit the pales of the church, and during the past
summer was again graciously revisited with the
Divine favor and forgiveness, and had, as far as the
writer is informed, continued to maintain, to the
night of his death, his restored confidence and
peace. An amiable, excellent, and pious wife,
stricken and scathed by this overwhelming mis
fortune, is left to buffet the ills of life in the lone
liness of widowhood, and with a son and daughter,
who still remain with her, continues to keep open
the Hotel which she now occupies, as the only
means of family support left available, and which,
it is sincerely hoped, will continue to receive that
amount of patronage to which her merits and ne
cessities so justly entitle her. A. Means.

Died, on the 11th inst., Martha Minerva, el
dest daughter of Elihu and Permelia VVatsou, aged
nineteen years and five months; and one hour and
fifteen minutes afterwards, their infant, Ann Eliza
Turpin.
Martha was early impressed with a sense of her
■inful state, and of her need of salvation; and
commenced seeking it immediately. Her sincerity
was evident, from her frequent approaches to the
mercy seat, and consistent course of conduct as a
seeker of religion. At a four days’ meeting in
this place, July, 1841, she gave herself to the Me
thodist E. Church, with a full determination never
to cease pleading with God until her suit should
be gained. It was not long before the Lord brought
deliverance to her captive soul; and she could
praise the most High for his forgiving love. It
was at a female prayer-inoeting in the Female
Academy, where she was converted. Like many,
■he was subject to doubts, as to her acceptance
with God, until about two years alter, when, du
ring another four days’ meeting, she was greatly
blessed, and received a deeper work of grace. She
jetiuucd this inestimable blessing until called
Thu* her heavenly father, in a moat remarkable
manner, prepared her for the hour of trial which
awaited her. She died of a pulmonary affection.
She was an ardent lover of the church, and a con*
slant attendant at the Sabbath school, and even,
when scarcely able to go, she felt it to be her duty
to attend, and her place was seldom vacant.—
Amiable, intelligent, and deeply pious, Bhe wAs
loved by all who knew her.
In her protracted illness, she was always calm
and composedfrequently filled with “joy un
speakable, and full of glory,” in prospect of her
approaching end. To her, death had lost his sting,
the grave its victory. “ Her delight” was emphat
cally, “in the law of the Lord, and in his law did
she meditate day and night.” When any of the
ministers visited, talked with and prayed for her,
she always was clear as to her hope of heaven.—
She talked as one “ quite on the verge of heaven.”
She was meek, patient, submissive and cheerful.
A few days previous to her dissolution, she request
ed the family to be called together, that she might
speak to them of her approaching end; and ear
nestly request them to meet her in heaven. She
assured them that it had been her constant prayer,
that when she died, she might leave a clear testi
mony behind, of her final salvation. And she said,
“Glory be to God, my prayer is answered, and 1
feel unspeakably happy. And although you may
weep at my departure, and at seeing my body con
veyed away to the cold grave ; yet you should re
member, that my soul will be singing and shouting
around the throne above. In this happy frame of
mind, she exhorted ail to meet her in heaven.—
Soon after this, she became weaker, and could not
speak ; but she was strong in faith, giving glory to
God. And thus sweetly, she fell asleep in the
arms of Jesus. This is truly a strong consolation
to her bereaved parents, and alllicted relatives,—
she rests in the paradise of God.

for more than forty years, a very exemplary mem
ber of the Methodist E. Church. From the time
of her conversion to her death, her life was marked
with a depth of piety which won the esteem of all
who knew her. She was particularly endearing in
the various relations of life, which God, in his
providence, called her to sustain. Early in the
spring, she was attacked with a disease which ter
minated her earthly career. Although her afflic
tion was long and severe, she manifested much
Christian fortitude. She would frequently express
a desire to leave this earth, and bo at test in hea
ven. She now sleeps in the arms of Jesus. Thus
lived and died, one who was much beloved. May
we die the death of the righteous, and may our last
end be like her’s. M. M.

MISCELLANY
From the New York Journal of Commerce.
THE SABBATH.
Gentlemen:—In your paper of the 29th in
stant you say, “ Men have come to see that it is
too great a slavery to work without any rest, and
that the good people who observe the Sabbath,
dress in clean clothes and go to church, are sa-1
gacious in what they do, as well as devout; and
are fairly getting the advantage in sound com
fort, over those who work on that day ; in short,
that they gain the day outright, since as much
tabor can be performed in six days, as in seven,
so that, to have no Sabbath is to five a dog’s life
for nothing.”
This is sound philosophy. And the reason
of it is, I think, fairly stated, in the testimony of
John Richard Farre, M. D., of London, before
a Committee of the British House of Commons,
an extract from which I herew ith send you.
“ I have practised as a physician between thir
ty and forty years; and, duing the early part of
my life, as the physician of a public institution.
I had charge of the poor in one of the most
populous districts of London. I have had oc
casion to observe the effect of the observance and
non-observance of the seventh day of rest dur
ing this time. 1 have been in the habit, during
a great many years, of considering the uses of
the Sabbath, and of observing its abuses. The
abuses are chiefly manifested in labor and dissi
pation. Its use, medically speaking, is that of
a day of rest. As a day of rest, l view it as a
day of compensation for the inadequate restora
tive power of the body under continued labor
and excitement. A physician always has re
spect to the preservation of the ’ restorative
power ; because, if once this be lost, his healing
office is at an end. A physician is anxious to
preserve the balance of circulation, as necessary
to the restorative power of the body. The or
dinary exertions of man run down the circula
tion every day of his life ; and the first general
law of nature by which God prevents man from
destroying himself, is the alternating of day
and night, that repose may succeed action. But,
although the night apparently equalizes the
circulation, yet it does not sufficiently restore its
balance for the attainment of a long lile. Hence
one day in seven, by the bounty of Providence,
is thrown in as a day of compensation, to per
fect by its repose, the animal system. You
may easily determine this question, as a matter
of fact, by trying it on beasts of burden. Take
that fine animal the horse, and work him to the
full extent of his powers every day in the week,
or give him rest one day in seven, and you will
soon perceive, by the superior vigor with which
he performs his functions on the other six days,
that this rest is necessary to his well being.
Man, possessing a superior nature, is borne along
me vuiy vigui ui iii5 imiiu, so mai me injury
of continued diurnal exertion and excitement
on his animal system is not so immediately ap
parent as it is in the brute ; but in the long run,
he breaks down more suddenly ; it abridges the
length of his life, and that vigor of his old age
(which as to mere animal power,) ought to be
the object of his preservation.”
1 he Committee above referred to was coin
posed of Sir Andrew Agnew, Sir Robert Peel,
Sir Robert Inglis, Sir Thomas Baring, Sir
George Murray, Fowler Buxton, Lord Mor
peth, Lord Ashley, Lord Viscount Sandon and
twenty other members of Parliament. The
Committee speak of Dr. Farre, as “ an acute
and experienced medical gentleman.”
And Dr. John C. Warren of Boston, in view
of this testimony, remarks : “I concur entirely
in the opinion expressed by Dr. Farre, whom'l
personally know is a physician of the highest
respectability.” The more this subject is in
vestigated, and the wider the dissemination of a
knowledge of the facts with regard to it the
more deep and permanent will be the conviction,
that “ the Sabbath was made for man." Those
who observe it, are, as a body, ordinarily, more
fcwitWy titan tbwu wbo ifo not. Tkey fcvn
longer, and are able, in the course of a year, to
do more work,—and do it in a better manner.
It was tried upon 2000 men. They were em
ployed seven days in a week. And to render
them contented in giving up the Sabbath as a
day of rest, (that birthright of man,) they paid
them double wages on that day: eight days
wages for seven days work. But they could not
keep them healthy, or moral. Things went
badly; and they changed the whole concern.
They put it into a six day’s arrangement. And
they did more work each year, than they had
ever done before. This, the Superintendent
states, was owing to two causes, viz.
“1. To the demoralization of the people un
der the first system: and
“ 2. To the exhaustion of bodily strength,
which was visible to the most casual observer.”
Respectfully yours, &c.
J. Edwards.
New York, Dec. 30, 1843.
TO CLERGYMEN AND PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
We copy from the London Record, the follow
ing reply to a correspondent, “ who seeks a
remedy for that affection of the trachea, of
which so many active clergymen complain.”
1. Let the throat be always kept at the same
even and low temperature at which any keeps
the face. Few ladies are attacked with this
tracheal irritation, because with them, habitually
the throat is open to the action of the cool air.
Many men, and clergymen in particular, tie up
the neck with a handkerchief with a pad in it,
or with a thick stock, and in this way the gland
ular and highly vascular substance of the neck
becomes peculiarly tender and susceptible, and
the tracheal passage suffers with it. Let
nothing be worn about the throat, either in win
ter or summer, but a plain thin mosella ( ?
marseillois) stock, which will not allow the
throat to become heated; and it will soon be
protected by habit from all swelling of the ten
sils by cold, and from the sympathetic irritation
of the treachea.
2. As a preventive, before the deduction of
the packing round of the throat, begin the ablu
tion with tepid water and vinegar, and gradually
come to the copious use of cold water, applied
by a sponge to the whole®?gion of the neck
and shoulders, rubbing afterwards with a coarse
towel, till the skin is well reddened. If this
plan is adopted in summer, by the time winter
arrives it will be found quite sufficient to wear
only the slight stock in the coldest weather, and
to sleep at night with the collar of the night
shirt unfastened, without taking cold.
many persons nave a very injurious mode
of speaking, by driving the sound from the chest
harshly and gratingly through the windpipe,
creating a sound which seems rather sepulchral
within the body, than flowing easily out of it.
It is far better to keep the mouth itself well open,
giving the whole instrument rather the charac
ter of a trumpet in which the effective sound
depends rather in a gentle steady filling of the
mouth of the trumpet for vibration, than blowing
into it violently. I believe this erroneous method
to be exhausting at all times, and rapidly destruc
tive of the organ. If the lungs are regularly
expanded at proper intervals, and the column of
inhaled air it allowed to flow out at a moderate
and quiet rate, and without the vehement mus
cular driving of the chest, while the articula
tion is easy and independent, like the fingering
of a flute, the natural instrument is then Treated
fairly, and will endure a degree of wear and tear
not often encountered.
These are the results of thirty years exper
ience, and though they appear minor matters,
yet, if properly attended to, they will be found
of real importance. Mtn of peculiar delicacy
of throat may by perseverance in this way, be
come robust and indomitable speakers.
Of course if there is a general constitutional
debility, collateral measures for improvement
must be adopted also, or these hints would be of
little avail.—Northern paper.
ANECDOTE OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.
The day had at length arrived when, with
knapsack on his shoulder, with staff in hand, and
with a desire to increase his knowledge by trav
elling! and to obtain peace and repose from the
dreadful agitations of western and of central Eu
rope, he sallied forth with a faithful French ser
vant, named Baudoin, to attain the objects he had
thus in view. How often in his quiet family
circle, at Neuilly, in after years did the Duke
converse with his friends and children relative
to this expedition. He had originally intended
at once to proceed to America ; but, on arriving
at Hamburg, his pecuniary resources were so
small, and his aunt, the Princess de Conti, on the
one hand, and his old and faithful friend, Mad
ame de Genlis, on the other hand, so unable to
assist him, that he came to the resolution of
wandering over the regions of the north. Ac
customed to brown bread and a draught of cold
water, to a hard mattrass, a very little wardrobe,
and to a variety of other privations, he proceeded
with a small letter of credit to Copenhagen,
procured passports for himself, for Baudoin, as
well as for his sincere friend, Count Montjoie,
and hastened, as economically and as rapidly as
he could, to the Scandinavian peninsula.
I remember to have met, in Switzerland, at
the pretty villa of a lady, formed to grace, adorn,
and elevate the circle of her family and friends,
of which she was the centre, an ingenious, able,
and delightful old Swiss gentleman, M. de Bon
stetten. Endowed with an admirable memory,
enriched by great acquirements and by classical
and historical knowledge, this most agreeable
and well-informed man was received with de
light into the best circles of Europe, and never
failed to enliven and enchant all who listened to
him. I connect his name with this portion of
the life of Louis Philippe, because he related to
me two anecdotes of the subject of this sketch
which may be relied on, and which are worth
preserving. Whilst at Hamburgh, on one oc
casion, an old refugee, a bad specimen of a good
race, openly assaulted him, and accosting him in
the public streets, demanded, 1 What right the
son of a regicide had to meet the victims of his
father’s atrocious conduct, and why he did not
hide his head in obscurity or the dust?’ The
young Duke, who was unprepared for this un
principled and ungenllemanly attack, fell back a
few paces, regarded his adversary with a look
of stern dignity, and then said,—> Sir, if I have
either offended or injured you, I am prepared, to
give you satisfaction: but, if I have done neither,
what will you one day think of yourself, for
having insulted, in a foreign land, a prince of
fallen fortunes, and an honest and independent
young man V The wretched creature, who had
so insulted him, stole off to his hiding-place,
whilst some bystanders, who had understood the
“SET A ROGUE TO CATCH A ROGUE.”
Whether the policy commended in this trite
adage be defensible or not, it certainly is not al
ways successful. 1st. That the Roman Cath

young and courageous
point we assume to be settled by the voice of
authentic history, running through a period of
fifteen hundred years. They have systemati
cally cheated every individual and nation giving
ear to them, out of the Scriptures, out of their
civil and religious liberties, out of every well
grounded hope of heaven,, and robbed them ol
money and moral principle, and the consolations
of true piety. Ana all this they are doing still,
to the utmost of their power. 2. That the
British ministry are great rogues, will not be
questioned by those who remember their treat
ment of the American Colonies,—of their Irish
subjects,—and of the Danish Fleet,—their wars
and usurpations in India.—their assault upon
China to secure the introduction of Opium, and
indeed the whole history of their progress to
their present eminence among the nations.
“ These two classes of “great rogues” are now
busily at work against each other. The Catho
lics are endeavoring to separate their beloved Ire
land from the empire, and establish a Parliament,
and make laws of their own, for the better se
curity of civil and religious privileges. Their
plans are settled,—their measures adopted,—and
the experiment is in progress. The British
ministry are endeavoring to catch them oy a bait
that has never been known to fail before,—a
pledge of the support from the National Trea
sury; thus making’ them dependent on the State,
and interested in preserving unbroken, the yoke
on the neck of Ireland. But, it is no go. For
once, the Catholics discover greater love for
their church, than for any independent pecuniary
support, and “ pledge themselves unanimously,
to resist, by every influence they possess, every
attempt that may be made, to make any State
provision for the Catholic clergy, in whatever
shape or form it may be offered.” What game
will be played next between the “ Great
Rogues,” time must reveal.—Boston Recorder.
READING.
Of all the amusements that can possibly be
imagined, for a hard-working man after his toil,
or in its intervals, there is nothing like reading
an interesting newspaper or book. It calls for
no bodily exertion, of which he has already had
enough, or perhaps too much. It relieves Ills
home of its dullness and sameness. It trans
ports him into a livelier, more diversified, and
interesting scene; and, while he enjoys himself
there, he may forget the evil of the present mo
ment full as much as if he were ever so drunk:
with the great advantage of finding himself the
next day with the money in his pocket, or, at
least, laid out in real necessaries and comforts
for himself and family,—and without a head
ache. Nay, it accompanies him to his next day’s
work; and what he has been reading gives him
something to think of besides the mere mechan
ical drudgery of his every-day occupation,—
something he can enjoy while absent, and look
forwaid to with pleasure. If I were to pray for
a taste which should stand me in stead, under
every variety of circumstances, and be a source
of happiness and cheerfulness to me through
life, and shield against its ills, however things
might go amiss, and the world frown upon me,
it would be a taste for reading.—Sir J. Herschel.
EXPORTATION OP WOMEN TO VIRGIN
IA IN 1620.
“ The enterprising colonists,” says Holmes,
“being generally destitute of families, Sir Ed
ward Sandys, the treasurer, proposed to the Vir
ginia company to send over wives for the plan
ters. The proposal was applauded, and ninety
girls, ‘ young and uncorrupt,1 were sent over in
the ships that arrived this year, and the year fol
lowing sixty more, handsome and well recom
mended to the company for their virtuous educa
tion and demeanor. The price of a wife, at first,
was one hundred pounds of tobacco,—but as the
number became scarce, the price was increased
to one hundred and fifty pounds, the value ol
which, in money, was three shillings per pound.
This debt for wives, it was ordered, should have
the precedency of all other debts, and be first re
coverable.” Another writer says that u It would
have done a man’s heart good to see the gallant
young Virginians hastening to the water side,
when a ship arrived from London, each carrying
a bundle of the best tobacco under his arm, and
each take back with him a beautiful and virtuous
young wife.”
OREGON INDIANS.
The Oregon Indians believe in the doctrine
of metempsychosis. The present race of beasts,
birds, reptiles and fish were men who once in
habited this earth. These they suppose still to
retain their peculiar language which they can
impart to those people into whom they may
pass. Such people are esteemed conjurers or
medicine men. They seem also to entertain no
tions of witchcraft, similar to those of the Pil
grim Fathers. Dr. Whiteman states that one
of them shot himself through the abdomen last
July, having done the same thing two years be
fore. After shooting himself, he prepared to
depart, mounted his horse and was off He re
turned again in a short time, pretending to be
a new man. His body was preserved from the
shot by a very thick leather shirt. This is
equal to some of Joe Smith’s Mormon miracles.
MATERNAL TENDERNESS.
A sparrow which had built her nest on a
thatc h roof of a house, was observed to continue
her visits long after the time when the young
birds had taken their flight. This unusual cir
t eumstanco continued throughout the year ; and
in the winter, a gentleman who all along had
observed her, determined on investigating the
cause. He, therefore, mounted a ladder, and
! found one of the young ones detained as a pris
oner by means of the worsted, which formed a
part of the nest, having accidentally twisted
round its leg. Being thus incapacitated from
procuring its own subsistence, it had been fed
and sustained by the continual exertions of its
mother. If this be no more than instinct, what
is reason ?—Raleigh Star.
IRRESOLUTION.
In matters of great concern, and which must
be done, there is no surer argument of a weak
mind than irresolution: to be undetermined
where the case is so plain, and the necessity so
urgent; to be always intending to lead a new
life, but never to find time to set about it; this is
as if a man should put off eating and drinking,
and sleeping, from one day and night, till he Is
starved and destroyed.—Tdlotson.
LADIES.
EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS.
BV CATHERINE E. BEECHER.
The physical and domestic education of daugh
ters should occupy theprincipal attention of moth
ei«ifockttdltttfl; a»d(fce rtfrtatotai Of this is
tellect should be very much reduced. As a gen
eral rule, daughters should not be sent to school
before they are six years old: and when they
do go, far more attention should be paid to their
physical development. They should never be
confined, at any employment, more than an hour
at a time ; and this confinement should be fol
lowed by sports in the open air. Such accom
modations should be secured, that,at all seasons,
and in all weathers, the teacher can send out a
portion of her school, every half hour for
sports.
In addition to this, much less time should be
given to school, and much more to domestic em
ployments, especially in the wealthier classes.
A little girl may begin, at five or six years oi
age, to assist her mother; and, if properly train
ed, by the time she is ten, she can render essential
aid. From this time, until she is fourteen or
fifteen, it should be the principal object of her
education to secure a strong and healthy con
stitution, and a thorough practical knowledge of
all kinds of domestic employments. During
this period, though some attention ought to be
paid to intellectual culture, it ought to be made
altogether secondary in importance ; and such
a measure of study and intellectual excitement,
as is now demanded in our best female semina
ries, ought never to be allowed, until a young
lad v has passed the most critical period of youth,
ana has a vigorous and healthy constitution fully
established.
And it is to that class of mothers, who have
the means of securing hired service, and who
are the most tempted to allow their daughters to
grow up with inactive habits, that their country
and the world must look for a reformation, in
this respect. Whatever ladies in the wealthier
classes decide shall be fashionable, will be fol
lowed by all the rest; while, if ladies of this
class persist in the aristocratic habits, now so
common, and bring up their daughters to feel as
if labor was degrading and unbecoming, the evils
pointed out will never find a remedy. It is,
therefore the peculiar duty of ladies who have
wealth, to set a proper example, in this respect,
and make it their first aim to secure a strong
and healthful constitution for thejp daughters,
by active domestic employments. All the sweep
ing, dusting, care of furniture and beds, and
clear starching, and the nice cooking should be
done by the daughters of a family, and not by
hired service. It may cost the mother more
care, and she may find it needful to hire a per
son for the express purpose of instructing and
superintending her daughters in these employ
ments, but it is what should be regarded as in
dispensable to be secured, either by the mother’s
agerfey, or by a substitute.
It is in this point of view, that the death of
good domestics in this country may, in its results,
prove a substantial blessing. If all house
keepers that have the means, could secure good
service, there would be little hope that so impor
tant a revolution, in the domestic customs of the
wealthy classes, could be effected. And so great
is the vis inertia of mankind, and the amount of
exercise, needful for health, would never be se
cured by those who were led to it by no necessi
ty, but merely from rational considerations. But
already the pressure of domestic troubles, from
the want of good domestics, has led many a
mother, in the wealthy classes, to determine to
train her daughters to aid her in domestic ser
vice ; and thus necessity is driving mothers to do
what abstract principles of expediency never
could secure.
A second method of promoting the same ob
ject is to raise the science and practice of domes
tic economy to its appropriate place, as a regular
study in female seminaries. But it is to the
mothers of this country, that the community
must look for this change. It cannot be expect
ed, that teachers, who have their attention ciefly
absorbed by the intellectual and moral interests
of their pupils, should properly realize the im
portance. of this department of education. But
if mothers generally become convinced of the
importance of this measure, their judgment and
wishes will meet the respectful consideration
they deserve, and the thing will be done.
ADVICE TO A DAUGHTER.
There is one point, my daughter, which is
too important to be omitted ; I refer to the de
portment which it becomes you to maintain to
ward the other sex. The importance of this,
both as it respects yourself and others, you can
scarcely estimate too highly. On one hand, it
has much to do in forming your own character
and I need not say that any lack of prudence in
this respect, even for a single hour, may expose
you to evils which no subsequent caution could
enable you effectually to repair. On the other
hand, the conduct of every female who has the
least consideration, may be expected to exert an
influence on the character of every gentleman
| with whom she associates; and that influence
j will be for good or evil, as she exhibits, or fails
j to exhibit, a deportment which becomes her. So
commanding is this influence, that it is safe to
calculate upon the character of any community,
| from knowing the privilege standard of female
character; and that can scarcely be regarded as an
exaggerated maxim, which declares that “ wo
men rule the world.”
Let me counsel you, then, never to utter an
expression, or do an act, which even looks like
soliciting any gentleman’s attention. Remem
ber that every expression of civility, to be of any
value, must be perfectly voluntary, and any
wish on your part, whether directly or indirect
ly, expressed, to make yourself a favorite, will
be certain to awaken the disgust of all who
know it. I would not recommend to you any
thing like a prudish or affected reserve, but even
this is not so unfortunate an extreme as an ex
cessive forwardness. AVhile you modestly ac
cept any attentions which propriety warrants,
let there be no attempt at artful insinuation on
one hand, or at taking a man's heart by storm on
the other.
Be not ambitious to be considered a belle. In
deed, I had rather you would be almost any
thing else, which does not involve gross moral
obliquity, than this. It is the fate of most belles,
that they become foolishly vain, think of nothing
and care for nothing, beyond personal display ;
and not unfrequently sacrifice themselves in a
mad bargain, which involves their destinies for
life. The more of solid and enduring esteem
you enjoy, the better ; and you oughr to gain
whatever of this you can by honorable means ;
but to be admired, caressed, and flattered; for
mere accidental qualities, which involve nothing
of intellectual or moral worth, ought to render
any girl, who is the subject of it, an object of
pity. You are at liberty to desire the good opin
ion of every gentleman of your acquaintance ;
but it would be worse than folly in you to be
ambitious of a blind admiration.
I will only add, that you ought to be on your
guard against the influence of flattery. Rely
on it, the man who flatters you, whatever he
may profess, is not your friend. It were a much
kinder office, and a real mark of friendship, to
admonish you tenderly; yet honestly, of your
faults. If you yield a little to flattery, you have
placed yourself on dangerous ground ; if you
continue to yield you are not improbably un

PUNCTUALITY IN SUNDAY SCHOOL
TEACHERS INDISPENSABLE
A young lad went home from his sabbath
I school, and remarked that his teacher had been
absent for some sabbaths, “ aud," said he, “ I
believe I shall not go any more till my teacher
returns."
“ That should make no difference with yon,"
said one. But he had become so much attached
to his teacher that he thought otherwise.
“ Well/’ inquired another of the family, “why
is he absent?" 1
“ Because he has so much to do during the
week, that he cannot find time to get the les
son, was the immediate reply of the lad.
Can that be true ? The affairs of this world
so engross a Christian that he cannot find time to
examine six or eight verses during the week, so
as to meet a class of young lads who may per
ish for lack of that knowledge? Is this the
truth, or a fabrication of some enemy of Chris
tianity to bring the cause into disrepute ? A
child who is an ardent friend of the teacher as
serts it. What a fact to be known to one who
should ever have the highest opinion of his
teacher, as a disciple of Jesus Christ! What
value must he think his teacher attaches to the
Bible from which he instructs him ? Can he
not give as much time to it as he says his pupils
should ? I forbear; for to multiply questions on
this topic is to multiply painful reflections._S.

“I SAW THE TEACHER LOVE HAD
TASKED.”
BY WILLIAM B. TAPPAN.
I saw the teacher love had tasked;
Her eye was bright, the pearls
Of truth dropped from her mouth, as asked
She questions of her girls;—
And as they pleasantly replied,
And gave the simple rule,—
I said that coroneted pride
Might learn at sabbath school. ' ; '
I saw the teacher them entreat
The Saviour now to love;
On earth to lie below His feet,
That they might rise above;—
And as the blessed tear-drops came
From sorrow’s troubled pool,
1 said religion’s holy flame
Is lit at Sabbath school.
I saw the teacher at the bed
On which a scholar lay;
Her heart was full, she wept and said,
“ This flower will pass away 1”
And while she fanned the flushing face,
The fever’s rage to ccol;
1 thought compassion has a place
With themes at sabbath school.
I saw the teacher breast the wave
Of storms the heart must know:
It rudely towered above, and gave
Her hope to gulphs below;
And when I saw her cheerful look,
Who loved a Sovereign’s rule;
I knew submission’s precious book
Was conned at sabbath school.

CHILDREN.
JEALOUSY.
“ Jane’s Piece is bigger than mine,” said John,
as he sat at table, pouting over his cake, and re
fusing to touch it. Any body might have lHtown,
by hearing this, that John was a jealous and sel
fish boy. If he had been kind-hearted and gene
rous, he would have been glad to see his little
sister have as much as she wanted, for she was
indeed a sweet girl. But no; it was all self with
him.
Jane then broke off half her cake, saying,
Here, John, take half of mine, and then you
will have the biggest piece.” J
“ 1 ":on’‘ bave says John. “ D’ye think
111 eat it after it has been in your hands ?”
He was angry with his mother, because he
thought she had been partial to little Jane; and
that made him cross and surly to her. But his
mother never thought of such a thing as being
partial. She loved all her children alike. She
had broken the cake without thinking whether
one piece was larger than the other or not. But
John’s jealous and selfish spirit made him unhap
py, grieved his kind mother, and would have
fretted his dear little sister, if she had not been too
generous to mind it.
If John lives to bea man, he will never be hap
py himself, nor will he let any body else be hap
py, unless he overcomes that jealous disposition,
and tries to love others as well as himself How
mean it is for brothers and sisters to be watching
each other, to see if one does not get more of a
good thing than another! If they love each
other, they will delight in one another’s happi
ness, and make it their own ; and when one gets
a new thing, all will rejoice in it, and be as glad
as if it were their own.— Youth's Companion.
BEAUTIFUL ANECDOTE.
A happier illustration of the wonderful char
acter of the Bible, and the facility with which
even a child may answer, by it, the greatest of
questions and solve the sublimest of mysteries
was perhaps never given, than at an examination
of a deaf and dumb institution, some years ago
in London. 6
A little boy was asked in writing, “Who
made the world ?”
He took the chalk, and wrote underneath the
question.
“ In the beginning, God created the heavens
and the earth.”
The clergyman then inquired in a similar
manner.
“ Why did Jesus Christ come into the
world?"
A smile of delight and gratitude rested on the
countenance of the little fellow as he wrote,
li This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the
world to save sinners.”
A third was then proposed evidently adapted
to call his most powerful feelings into exercise.
“ Why were you born deaf and dumb, when
I can hear and speak ?”
“Never,” said an eye-witness, “shall I for
get the look of resignation which sat upon his
countenance as took the chalk and wrote,
“Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy
sight.’” }
LET ME DIE THUS.
A little Ceylonese girl embraced the sweet
religion of the dear Saviour. She had a wicked
grandfather, who dragged her by the hair, and
beat her because she read her Bible and prayed.
But she did not complain. By and by, she died
and when her poor ignorant mother described
her death, she did it by saying of her, “ She
prayed, was silent, and died j” Does not every
reader say, “ Let me die thus ?» *
