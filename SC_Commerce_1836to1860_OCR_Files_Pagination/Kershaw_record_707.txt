IS TilBRB AN UNilEBiBVEit
BV THOMAS IIAYNES BAYLV.
Is there an unbeliever!
One man who wa'ks the earth,
And madly doubts that Providence
Watched o'er liirn at his birth! '
He robs mankind for ever
Of hope beyond the tomb;
: What gives he as a recompense?
The brute's unhallowed doom?
1
In manhood's loftiest hour,
la health, and strength, and pride,
O! lead his s'eps through alleys green,
Where rills 'mid cowslips glide;
Climb nature's granite tower,
Where man hath rarely trod;
And will lie then in such a scene,
Deny there is a God!
Yes!?he proud heart will ever
Prompt the false tongue's reply!
An omnipotent Providence
Still madly ho" 11 deny;
But see the unbeliever
Sinking in death's decay;
And hear the cry of penitence!
Ho never learn'tl to pray.

CURIOUS CASE OF ADDUCTION.
The Lewi* Times narrates an incident
which lies just occurred in Yorkshire, fit
* to grace a novel. The hero is a groom,
courted by his master's dauglite-; and his
courage and determination towards the!
close of the eventful history prove that his
discretion ami distru-t at the commencement
were caused by no lark of manly
spirit. About nioeniotilhsag", .Mr. Charles
a trmltliv American merchant,
came tr> settle wiili his family, a wife and
two daughters, at Mirlield. Among the
servants, ernplovnd as hunts" or opca- j
sional groom, was Benjamin Hail, for
whom thp elder Miss Brook, twenty-three
years of age, conceived an ardent passion.
Whenever lie was at work in the yard, she
watched him from oi.e of the windows;
and she never left it ti .til he had finished
? his task. The \ Otith did not suspect her
feelinps, hot was often heard t > eoniplain
of Iter eondnet, heea ;se, h s i:d, 4*il seemed
as if lie rotild not do his dmv, \\ ithont
being washed.'' At length .Miss Brook
employed a tnorc direct language than that
of th?? eye; she eonlrived to impart her
feelings to B njamiti. and to inspire him '
with a return of affection: overeomingj
some seriiides which he entertained, she
I
persuaded him to consent i<* tneir mur j
rin^e; and sh?* furnished him, on Saturday
fortnight, with the menus to purchase a license.
F>r the sequel we burrow tin*
words of Leeds Times:

After the ceremony was over, they again
returned to the Black Boll Inn. In the

usual, and seated theiuselves at the breakfast
table: but the \nuiiii lady's place was

alarmed, I am only gone to get married.'
This of course put the whole house in a
0 %
ferment: and Messrs. Gen. Mitchell ("f tin*
Yew Trees,) Fearnsides, and Fair
burn, and other neighbors, were called in,
and sent in quest of the fugitives. Brstal,
being about three miles distant, was,
thought to be the destination of the lovers. J
.Mr. Mitchel arrived first on horse back;'
and proceeding to the Black Bull Inn,
found them in the traveller's room. The j
bridegroom bid him 'good morning;' and
observed, 'had yon been here ball an hour
ag you would It ive just been in time for
the wedding.* 'What!' said he in a rage, \
Ml is over?* and darling nut of the room, j
went to the vicar to ascertain the fact.?
Mr. I'eald assured him that it was true:
remarking, 'I hate o'tlvjus! returned from
the church ' 'And cannot von, then,' replied
Mr. Mitchell, undo what you have,

Ciod had joined together,1 hv giving the
bridegroom into enst-dy on the r!i rge of

much for ifi? young lady's equanimity.? [
She then slooil forth, and said in a tone ofi
great anger, 'No, gentlemen; Benjamin is |

turning to ?ior hushand. and presenting1

The eh urge then, of course, fi ll to the |
ground; and all parties fur several hours
sat in .sullen silence, save the sighs and

Bcniamin, whom we shall call Mr. Hall,
rose and s:iid to his wife and his brother
(a minor, who had been engaged to give
the ladv in marriage.) 'C 'me, let us t'.otv
irn hnrne.' Upon which Mr. Fearnssdcs
exclaimed in a frantic manner, 'if you attempt

niraiii all became sentcdand silent. While
tilings remained in this state, the young
lady's father (who had only just returned
front Liverpool) arrived at the inn. Upon
his entering the room, Mrs. 11.ill imuiedi
ati ly rose, and eourlesying, seized him l>v
the hand; an ', after complaining bitterly
of the conduct of the individuals present,
stated her warm attachment to her Benjamin.
After Mrs. Mall had done speaking,
all again became silent f ir a considerable
time. At length, some refreshments were
ordered, ami a more conciliatory policy
adopted. It was ultimately and mutually
agreed that they should all return to Mirfield,
and see if they could accommodate
matters. Accordingly, at night; horses,
phaeton, and gig, were brought out, and
the party started nfi'fnr Mil field; Mr. Hall
being between two of the gentlemen in
the phaeton, and Mrs. Hail being between
the other two in the gig. They arrived
at Mirfield at ten o'clock; and the phae.
ton turned up the road leading to Mr.
Brook's residence. At this moment, Mr.
Hall turned his head, and perceived thai
the gig, containing his lady, was proceeding
at a tnpid rate on ihe road toward*

he railed out 'whoa, who!* ami
the horse, knowing the voire ttfiis former
indulgent keerprr, immediately stood -till
him; obstinately refused t t hndgp. The
young lady's ki ppers, hearing Mr. Uall:

after two o'clock "u Wednesday iii r11i 11 ;
a uiji, containing two men and a female,

and seized the It >r>c by the reins. Tw..

and feed to lake hiin ofl", ami hold him
while the gig ?r??l away. They did so;
hut two other individuals Cuming up, ami
In-ing informed of the cause of his being
detained, they attacked the watchman a
scuffle ensued, and ultimately Mr. llall
was released, when he immediately set off
in the direction the gig had taken. lie,
however, never overtook tliein, nor was
he able l > trace ihem illrc>n >!l any ofllie
t"ll-jiates; and ii hissince been ascertained
that the female in thegijr was not his wife,
but only one of i\lr. Kilner's servants,
who was placed there in order to decoy
him from the premises. It was also discovered
thai a chaise conveyed Mrs. H^ll
I root Mmldersfield to Manchester, at midnight,
on Thursday week, when it was ob
siTt-eil 11):i t the irtfli vifltials who had charge
of lo r li.ul hiird work In pacify Iter.
This circumstance reached the ears of
Mr. Hall, and lie started at 10 o'clock on
Fridav night from Mirfield by omnibus, to
Eiud.-lrr>field, nmi fr?.rn thence, in company
with two friends, bv gig to Manchester.
They then proceeded, by the firs',
train on Saturday morning, to Liverpool.
Owing, however, to his inexperience and
mismanagement, he returned home on
Wednesday night hist, without having accomplished
the object of his mission. An
einiii> nt solicitor, however, has now taken
his ease in hand; and if the young lady is
not produced in a few days, it is more than
piobahlc that legal proceedings will be!
commenced against the parties implicated
in her abduction. We understand that
the young lady possesses from 15.000/ to
20.000Z. bequeathed to her by a deceased
uncle in Amerirn, and independently ?<f
her father. It is supposed by those most:
competent to form an opinion, that she is
Miner in I lie Isle ol Man, or lias open snipoff
to America. Herniations, however,
refuse lo give any iuformatioii; consequently
it remains an alisolule mystery.
The Heaver Hat outdone.?On the
13ih nit. lli r Whigs of Syracuse (many of
whom are largely engaged in the manufacture
of-alt) held a protection meeting,
and "resolved" to send, as a present to
Henry Clay, 30 barrels of salt, in token ;
of their admiration of the tariff1, which will
compel the farmer to buy salt of them at
their own price hereafter. It is reported
that a wag present made a motion that an
equal quantity should be distributed to the
poor laboreis in the vicinity, lo season
their 'Toast beef" with; which was hissed

The following from Mr. McCtillottch's
Dictionary will no doubt be read with inlet

s ilial, under lite peculiar circumstances
in which America is placed, agriculture is
necessarily the most advantageous employment
which her poptila imi can engage;
and it is a slu.rl sighted, false policy
to etideaVi>r, hvdint of custom house regit,
lalions, to force up a mnoiifiiciuring interest.
The boundless extent of hor fertile
and unoccupied laud gives her extraordinary
advantages compared with almost
every other people in respect to agriculture;
but she has no such advantages as
regards manufactures, and vet it is plain
that, unless the work-people engaged in
manufactures in different parts of the union
realized the same rate of wages, and the
capitalists the same rate ol profits that is
realized hy the workmen and capitalists
engaged in agriculture, they would either!
never engage in the former, or speedily* J
abandon it lor tin* latter. uence me in-j
liliiy of all atiemp's to establish the finer
brancbesof manufacture in America, vviifi- j
oil burdening similar articles whenim-j
ported frotn abroad with heavy duties.?
The coarser 'description of articles, or
tiiose which are bulky and heavy, and in
which lite value ot m? raw material pxceeds
tin; value of ilit* workmanship must,
ol' course, in America us elsewhere, be always
produced at home. But the finer tiescriptiuii
of goods, or those of which the
value or price is principally made up
wages and profits would, but for the inlerference
of Congress, be wholly imported
from countries in which wages and prollis
are comparatively low. And it is
needless to say, that every attempt to limit
or hinder such importation is inconsistent
with, and subversive of every sound
principle. If the cotton and woolen manufactures
now carried on in thp U. States
cannot exist without a duty of 23 or 41) per
cent, being laid oil foreign cottons and
woolens, it is plain that the existence of
such manufactures obliges every individual
in the United Slates to pay Co to 33
per cent, additional price for every yard
of their produce that he has occasion to
use. And even this is not all; for the pro.
Iiibiiinti withdraws a large portion of the
public capital and industry from employments
in which America has an advantage
to make them he vested in employments
in which tlie advantage is on the side of
others.
"The commercial policy of America is,
in trmh, but little creditable to her people
and legislature. The prohibitions that
have so long fettered the employment of
industry, and lite growth of commerce in
Europp, grew up in a comparative'}* dark
and unenlightened age, and have for many
years been, progressively declining. But
America has been foolish enough to adopt
the nroliibilorv and forcing system after
it*felo de sc character had been fully demonstrated.
?he hail nut acted in ignorance,
but in contempt of well-established
principles and of the most c >mprehensive
experience; and bus consequently involved
herself in difficulties and losses of which
it is not eaiy to estimate the extent, nor to
foresee the termination.
"No doubt America will gradually become
more and more suitable for manufacturing
industry; and her command o(
water-power and of coal, and Iter facilities
for internal transport and navigation,
are circumstances eminently favorable to
manufactures. Still, however, it is certain
that Iter natural progress to mantifacluring
em'nence cannot be hastened, but
must, in fact, be retarded bv the policy on
wlurh she has embarked. When population
has become dense in America, and
Iter unoccupied land has been generally
appropriated, she will necessarily undertake,
and will no doubt successfully carry
on such branches of manufacturing industry
as are suitable to her peculiar capa
bilities; but ibis natural devoJopement of
Iter maturer growth must be waited for;
and though it mav be delayed, cannot be
forwarded by Interfering with the free exercise
of industry.
A writer in the N. Y. Spirit of the Times*
gives a giaphic sketch of the late prizefight,
the following is the conclusion:
"As soon as he had been declared the
victor, Lilly jumped up, slapped hi* hands
with an exclamation of joy, and then amid
the eheeisof his circle, sprung over the
nutcs of the ring. lie was but little mark
ed, and n>>t severely hurt. Poor McCoy
on being lifted from the ground, sank as
limp as a rag in his seconds arms. A cry
was made for the Doctor, and a movement
in the mass took place to give him air. I
forced my way in the crowd and look a
look at the dying man. G??d grant that 1
may never see such another sight! He
lay upon his hark, his face and neck one
bruised, unseemly, bloated mass of incipient
corruption; gasping for brea'h, and
sucking by the violence of his respiration,
his bloated lips far back in bis month. In
the next moment he ceased to breathe;
and the word went in a hoarse whisper
round that he was dead!
.Never shall 1 forget the talismantic horror
of that expression. The cheeks ofold
and young, the fledgling villain, and the
rnflian steeped in crime, nil blanched to
ashes, and exchanging a look of vague and
undefined fear, separated silently and
sought their respective boats. I saw but
one man unmoved. He knew, with the
rest, thai another tight had been promised
in the same ring, and unwilling to loose
the sport, exeliii ned as poor McCoy was
born* to the nvei side, "Come, carry off
the dead, and product* your next man!" i
should say that rnflian is doomed to arrive
at gie.it eminence in hell. N'>t a loud
sound or rough expression was heard by
the vast assen binge that collected at the
binding. Solemnly each man embarked,
and silently the vessels cast off and bore
away. I went in the dead man's boat, and
sailed back with him, lying stark, corrupt
and dead, in the same cabin, where he in
the morning lay lull.of life, health, hope,
strength and inanhond. The fight be'ars
its own comment. I leave the moral with
the reader."
The same writer gives the origin of the
lit as follows.
"The fight between Christopher Lilly
anil Thomas McCoy originated at a sparing
exhibition, in the Bowery, where both
parties met shortly after thp former's victory
over Murphy. They had been old
acquaintances, and there was an unsettled
grudge between them. Amid the general
encomiums bestowed on the jouihf'ul conqueror,
McCoy's voice was silent, and
when challenged for his opinion, gave it in
tit.,n m tItr> m-pi'/iilinc sentiment.?
- ?- i o
This Lilly couldn't boar, > iul f. eling desirous
t?? brush away any existing doubts
asked Tom input the gloves on with 'hint
lor a set-to; the latter refused, and on the
instant, Lilly hit him a straightforward
blow that carried him to the floor. iWcCoy
rose and rushed in, but they were
soon separated, and a match instantly
proposed. Every thing was soon arrang

cm:; a deposit was ciianr that evoninff or
the next day, made, an-! each party weflt

of James Sunford, and Lilly in ilie carc of
