PROCLAMATION.
Mayor's Omen, )
Dtoc, 30, IS&* noon. $
Pellow Citizens : The report that outrages
hare .bednVomrrfitted by persons
from Canada, upon the lives and property
* of our inhabitants, has justly excited in
your bosoms that spirit which is so worthy
of American citizens.
All legal measures will be promptly
taken to prevent any future aggression*
and you will be called upon as fast as
your services are required. In the mean
time, I enjoin you all to act with discretion,
and only under the direction of the
proper authorities.
The Common Council having placed
ample means at my disposal fur the de.
fence of the city, nothing will be wanting
on my part to ensure the safety of all,
and for the purpose I feel assured that I
shall be fully sustained by you.
A competent and well armed city guard,
bf respectable citizens, has been organized,
under the authority of the Common
Council, and sworn in as a city patrol.
The laws must be strictly enforced;
and. to nrevent any unnecessary alarm.
' ? / '
the firing of guns after sundown is forbid*
den, and the ordinance in relation thereto
will be readily enforced. It is to be
hoped, however, in limes like the present,
no pefson will.bo found who will wanton*
ly violate any law.
The firemen arc requested to be on the
alert, and see that their engines are in
good order, though it is not to be hoped
that they will have no occasion to use
them.
Citizens arc requested to call at any and
alf times at this office, to report 6r receive
orders.

SPEECH OP QUEEN VICTORIA,
At tits opening of tf^gritiak Parliament.
, twun of Lords, (
Monday Nor. 90. J
#his being the day fixed by Her Majesty,
for * delivering the royal speech in
her first Parliament, the avenues to the
house were crowded from an early hour.
A few minutes before two o'clock, a
. flourish of trumpets, the ringing of bells,
and the firing of caunop from the Park,
announced the departure of her majesty,
j The Lord Chancellor then left the house
to receive the Queen, and in about ten
| minutes another flourish of trumpets pro!
claimed her Majesty's approach.
Her Majesty was received throughout
' the whole of her progress With the warmest
cheers Of Her subjects, who were
crowding the Park and each side of the
. street from the Horse Guards to Westminister,
and filling every balcony. Even
I... - " - -
me roois 01 tne houses were in many
places occupied, as was also the roof of
St. Margaret's Church.
At two o*clo%ck precisely, her Majesty,
having been robed, entered the house,
preceded by the aeraids and officers of
I state, accompanied by the Duchess of
Kent, and attended by the Duchess of
Sutherland, mistress of the robes, and Lady
Barham, lady in waiting, the Master of
the Horse, the Treasurer, and other members
of her household. Her Majesty,
who appeared in excellent health, wore a
white satin gown, over which was a
splendid crimson velvet robe trimmed
with gold lace. On her head was a tiara
of diamonds, she also wore a diamond
necklace and ear-rings, and on her arm
the order of the Garter.
Her Majesty then desired the Lords to
be seated, and ordered tho Usher of the
Blach Rod to summon the Commons. In
a few minutes the Commons appeared at
the bar, headed by the Spcakor, supported
on the right by the Usher of the Black
Rod, and on the left by the Sergeant at
Arms. The space below the bar was
crowded to excess with members, and it
was not till after several rather undignified
cries of "Full, full,*' and "order, order,"
had been uttered, that the pressure
of the mcmbeis excluded could bo stopped.
Silence having been obtained, her
Majesty took and subscribed the usual declaration,
repeating every sentence after
the Lord Chancellor. This ended, his
Lordship^ bending on one knee: presented
his Sovereign with a copy of the following
most gracious speech, which her Majesty
immediately delivered;?
"My Lords and Gentlemen,
"I have thought it right to assemble
you for the transaction of public business
at the earliest convenient period after the
dissolution of the late Parliament.
"It is with great satisfaction that I have
received from all foreign powers the
the strongest assurances' of their friendly
disposition, and of their earnest desire
to cultivate and maintain with me the relations
of amity; and I rejoice 111 the
prospect that I shall be able to promote
lire best interests of my subjects by securing
to them the advantages of peace.
"I lament that civil war slill afflicts the
kingdom of Spain. I continue to exercise
with fidelity the engagements of n\y
crown with the Queen of Spain, according
to the stipulations of the treaty of
quadruple alliance.
"I have directed a treaty of commerce
swhich 1 have concluded "with the united
republic of Peru and Bolivia to be laid
before you, and 1 hope soon to be able to
communicate to you similar results of
my negotiations with other powers
"I recommend to your serious consideration
the state of the province of Lower
Canadfr. .
"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
"The demise of the Crown renders it
necessary that n new provision should be
made for the civil list. 1 Dlace tinre
I servedly at your disposal those heieditary
[ revenues which were transf red to the pub
lie by my immediate predecessor, and I
have commanded that such papers as may
be necessary for the full examination oi
the subject shall be prepared and laid before
you. Desirous that the expenditure
in this, as in eveiy other department of
the goVernpient, should be kept within
due limits, I feel confident that you will
gladly make adequate provision tor tinsupport
of the hdnor and dignity of the'
crown. . 1
"The estimate for the services oi next
year are in course of preparation, and1
will be laid before you at the accustomed
period. I have directed that the utmost i
economy should be enforced in every
branch of the public expenditure.
"My Lords and Gentlemen,
''The external peace and domestic tranquility
which at present happily prevail
are very favorable for the consideration
of such measuies of reformation and
amendment as may be necessary or expe
dicnt, and your attention will naturally
be directed to that course of legislation
which Waft interrupted by the necessary
dissolution of the last Parliament,
j. "The result of the inquiries which
have been made into the condition of poor
in Ireland has been already laid before
Parliament, and it will be your doty to
consult whether it may not be safe and
I wise to establish by law some well regula'
ted means of relief for the destitute in
that country. ,

morning, we learn that ou the 2*>?h nil.,
between Pea's Creek and the Bin Cypress
swamp, a small party of Indians were
| seen aiul pursued, and when the pursuing

Col. Thompson; Capt. Van Swearihgen, j
Lieut. Brook, and Lieut. Center, Captain,
Andrews and Lieut. Walker, all of the

The loss of the Indians not ascertained,
but presumed to be large. A few days
previous Gen. Jesup cfeplured 27 Indians,
near Fort Lane.
Since the above was written we have
been politely furnished with the following
extra, which painfully confirms the above
statement.

not distinctly slated where action took
place, but presume must have been in the
immediate vicinity of Lake Kissimmce,
as we know by previous accounts, via
Fort Mellon, of his being there on the 23d
of December. Both parties must have
fought with the most determined bravery.

It irill be found on reference to our columns thai
the news of the week, from both North and South,
are of a highly interesting character*
The firo which occurred at Now Orleans on the

Mr. Alexander Younu's Hook Store and onquire foi
the above styled work, which gives a very interesting
description of tho moet prominent features of the face

to which this portion of the West is rapidly advancing
; to winch is appended the Letters of a Rambler

with a Map of the State, tho most complete

The Semlnoles again Victorious.?A battle wui
fought on tiie 28tli ult., somewhere betweon Pea

and 1000 oi our troops, in which 28 of our army
were killed oud 111 wounded. Among the killed
woro several officers?the loss of tho enemv is
?r
presumed to be very large, and one report states that
they were completely cut up, notwithstanding, not
a single one was found dead 011 the field, why ; we
leave our readers to surmise. Each of the Sominoles
ablo to bear arms, havo already been computed to
have cost the country not loss than one hundred
thousand dollars?how much more it will cost before
this shameful war shall be terminated, wo also loave
our readers to imagine.
Wo havo no sufficient data at this moment, (saye
the N. Y. Gazette,) to make up an opinion as to the
dep. or a bio ev;:n, at Schlosscr. We disbclieze the
details, and shall wait to see them proved before we
throw ourselves or our readers into any agony on the
subject; because we remember how much excellent
sympathy was thrown away upon the barbarous treat,
menl of poor Dr. Bouchette, who certifies under liis
own li'uid that thero was no barbarity about it; but
on the contrary, that ho was most humanely ant!
kindly treated.

notoriety upon a perfidious breach of our neutrality
with the nation on our friondly intercourse with
which two-thirds of our whole foreign commerce depends.
