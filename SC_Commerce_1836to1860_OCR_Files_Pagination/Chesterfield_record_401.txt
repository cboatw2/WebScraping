AN
EASY WAY OF ASCERTAINING THE
HEIGHT OF A TREE, STEEPLE, &C. ON LEVEL
GROUND.
\yhen tltesun shines fix a pole of known
length perpendicularly on n level surface;
measure the length of the shadow, and at
the same time, measure the shadowfof the ,
tree or other object whose hiight you wish
to ascertain; then according to simple proportion,
or the Single Rule of Three, as the
h-ngth of the pole's shadow is to the length
of the pole, so &the length of the tree's
shadow to the height, of the tree. Example:
Suppose the leng:h of the pole to bo
10 feet, and the length of its shadow 14 feet,
and the lengh of the shadow of the tree or
other object 124 fee"; then:
14:10:124 .

Thus the height is ascertained to be 88

to six sevenths, of an inch.
If the nhiert wh(?n lifeht VOU wish tO ob

is not perpendicular, then you must
give your pole the same degree and direc- j
tiou of inclination with Uie object.

old weighed 122 lb. ond 64 days afterwards
weighed 410 lb. being a gain of 4J lb. per

When employing an overseer for your
plantation, or a foreman for your shop, enquire
firsr, into his moral cljuiraclcr; second, j
into big habit as to early rising; and then
into his industry and acquaintance.with the
business for which you need him. If his
morals arc bad, he is not to be trusted; and
jf belies in bed till sun rise, be warns jy)irit
and energy to manage any business efficiently.
In xsitber case keep clear of him,
whatever his other qualifications.
If you have a job for a Mechanic, send to
a shop where you hear the hammer by sunrise,?or,
ten to one, your work will not be
done when it is promised; and mostly likelyt*hen
it is done it is badly done, and.
you are charged more than it is worth. Industrious
t ffioicnt mechanics are the least
nnt to sliuht their work, and the most apt
~~r * ? ~ o i
to be satisfied with a fair price.
. Mechanics who work all day (and indeed
all persoos who regard comfort or health or
|ong life) ought to be in bed so early at
nigbt ax to have time for sleep enough fully
to refresh them before day. But those who
spend the early part of the night in revelry
cannot do so; and this is too commonly the
first cause of late rising among laborers.

. * - THE GRASSES.
Providence has kindly scattered hisblrssi
in due proportion over the earth. He
' has endowed man with int IJigence
and industry, to enable him to appropriate
to his own us'*, the various productions
in the wide field of nature from
which he may derive subsistence and comfort.
Ther? is no country so sterile, which
man by seizing on the productions around
him, may not render subservient to his use,
nndfrom which be may not derive a support.

In laying dow n lands for hay or pasture a a
greater mixture of seed is used than in the a
i Northern States of our own country. The li
i.grasses most commonly cultivated are red 0
clover, while, clover, limoihy or herd's n
grass, rye grass, crested dog's 'tail grass, ?
! vernal grass, trefoil; &e. To this may he I
j added as fodder for cattle various.species of o
I vetch?as well as turnips, carrots, the sugar c.
beet, &c. The invaluable herd's grass? j
our timothy ( Vleum pralense,) was exten- il
! shely cultivated in this country before its va- t
I lue was known in Europe, and has only of s
; la e come into repute in the latter country. J |
I I believe in America it received is name j

mer.t than this uad often conferred immortality

In many portions of France I observed a g<

Until of late years the varieties of the h
ommon rye grass {Lolium pcrenne.) were si
egarded in England as produc-ng more ir
rass and hajt than any other species. They lj
re stilt cultivated almost universally on 1
mds which are expected to be converted h
nto wheat fields after one or two years, a
iomc of these varieties are annuals, others o
erenninl. None ofthem remain, however, k
no re than three or four years, when it is noessary
to re-cultivutc the ground. f,
At the present lime the Italian rye grass j:
Lolium Ilalicum.) is regarded on the con. ||
ineht of Europe as the most productive of
II the species. It is perennial ; the leave* a
re broader, and it is said no: to bcaflecli'd w

He concludes by saying, " I can assure

' There is scarcely a question of a political

?' my opinions already expressel were to be

wj^'11 tried and fii bfui1,friend, Maj. Gwynn.
Letters requiring more particular Ht'eiflton I'
I answered myself. Kver'y body who knows
Major Gwynn knows that he is not one,
? whom I would employ to write a political
r letter, lie is a self-made m >n?a" soldier
' and n gentleman?bul neither a politician
nor a scholar. I hskfid the service of h:m,
; because hewas rny friend, and 1 confided
1 in him, and it was plain aud simple. My !

I reply to myself. Such as may be easily
answered by another, I hand to my friend,

' " 7 - - -- p

"Refer the writer to speech at Vincrtncs1'

But it seems that M ijor Gwynn was

. Cincinnati or of Hamilton county., Wh? u
i the famous CKwcgo letter was- rf ccived, j'
