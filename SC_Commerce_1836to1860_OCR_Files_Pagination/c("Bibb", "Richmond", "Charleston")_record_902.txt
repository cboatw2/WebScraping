NEW SUBSCRIBERS.
During the month of February the names o
323 New Subscribers were received at the office
of the Southern Christian Advocate. In the
course of March 553.—We hope the present
month will be still more abundant than the past.
Never since Methodism first existed at the South,
was there such a call for strenuous effort as just
now.
ALTERATION OF THE SIXTH RESTRIC
TIVE RULE.
From data in our possession, says tlie Richmond
Ch. Advocate, we. are satisfied that a constitu
tional majority for the alteration of the sixth re
strictive regulation of the discipline will not be ob
tained. At present the vote Stands thus, accord
ing to our informant.
Affirmative.
Conferences heard
from 1,740
Conf. not heard from,
but believed to be
unanimous. 754
Philadelphia and New
Jersey, probably 30
Negative.
Conferences heard
from 7G7
Philadelphia and New
Jersey conferences
having about 300
votes will give pro
bably 270
2,530
1,037
According to this statement there are 3567 vo
ters, and of these 1037 in the negative ; and there
ought to be, in the affirmative, 2676 to secure the
alteration of the article. So the recommendation
of the General Conference fails by nearly 150
votes.
But it is proper to say that the minutes of 1844,
give a total of 4282 travelling ministers, while it
appears from the above table that only 3567 voted
upon the question, showing a difference of about
700 between the number voting, and those entitled
to vote. This difference may be accounted for
perhaps, as follows: The Maine Conference whose
vote was not given, 171. Travelling preachers, on
trial, not entitled to vote, 500, (we find more than
900 in the Minutes for 1844,) and the rest may
be very easily made up of absentees.
These facts satisfy us that the question is lost.
The Northern Conferences have refused to divide
the property of the Church with their Southern
brethren. But will this stay or prevent the di
vision of the Church ? Not a whit ! There is
something more than money involved in this
question. And dollars and cents can never be
suffered to mingle in a question of principle. The
Southern Conferences will unquestionably sepa
rate, money, or no money.—They go for principle,
not interest. "
The Boundary Lines.—There is vastly more
to be gained than lost by the Southern Connec
tion if the North insists upon a departure from the
rule ordered to be observed by the late Ge neral
Conference in regard to the Northern boundary of
said connection. We do not care to say at this
time, all we know on the subject. It is sufficient
just to affirm that if the North is determined to
attempt to organize churches or societies in the
Southern country, they are welcome to all the
good they will get from the enterprize. Let them
come and try the experiment. The South-Western
Christian Advocate says on this subject:—“If
the North wish the lines specified in the Plan of
Separation, stricken out, and wish to extend their
jurisdiction in the South wherever they may find
adherents, we presume the South cannot enter
tain any very serious objections, at least so far as
they themselves are concerned. There are many
true friends to the South, North of the lines pre
scribed, and we doubt not we shall find an open
door for our ministers where the people will gladly
receive the word at their mouth. Our understand
ing, at the time of adopting the Plan, was that the
General Conference had an eye to the mutual
good of both branches of the Church, and the
peace and prosperity of all concerned ; so we
think the provision a wise arrangement, and are
willing to abide by it; yet if the North decide to
overrule the General Conference in this arrange
ment, and push their jurisdiction over the line, we
can but make up any loss we may sustain by re
prisals from those who would invade our territory,
or disregard our rights.”
Key West, Fla.—We learn from the Rev.
A. Graham, that there is a Methodist society at
Key West, consisting of about forty members,
principally made up of Wesleyan Methodist emi
grants from the Bahama Islands. The church is
in a thriving condition, and much interest is mani
fested on the part of the people. The chapel is
crowded to overflowing every Sunday. They
have also a flourishing Sunday School which pro
mises great good. This is unquestionably an im
portant field of ministerial labour, and we trust
our good friend Graham will be abundantly suc
cessful in winning souls to Christ, and building
up the cause of God on this Southern outpost of
American civilization.
Columbia Ct., Florida Conference.—We
learn from the Rev. W. W. Griffin, that a gracious
revival of religion, which commenced during the
past fall, is still in progress on th'is circuit, between
eighty and a hundred have been admitted on trial
in the M. E. Church.
Death of Mrs. Smith.—The last number of
the Richmond Christian Advocate records the
death of Mrs. Laura Smith, wife of the Rev. D[.
Smith of the Virginia conference.
Fur the Southern Christian Advocate.
TO THE REV. T. MEREDITH, ED
1TOR, &c.
Rev. Sir,—Whether I desire it or not, it now
seems inevitable that I am to gain considerable
notoriety with the readers of your paper. Two
exquisite wights of Anson, and another, who 1
/
suppose hails from some place, though lie does
not tell us where, aro aiding you in contributing to
that result. Of the two former I have, once for
all, disposed in the Southern Christian Advocate of
the 14th instant. Of the latter I have only to
say; let him have all the benefit that he intended
to secure to himself, by skulking behind a fictitious
signature; for the cause which I defend does not.
require me to raise a stick at every anonymous
scribbler that brays at me. But you, sir, must be
respectfully attended to, especially when you
honour mo with such a notice ns is found in your
paper of the 1st instant.
But how is it, sir, that such a change has come
over your mind! fn the last production of yours
which 1 noticed, you very earnestly put me in the
category of dunces. After having slept upon that
tor some six weeks, you seem to have waked up
suddenly, and you commence your last piece by
comparing me to Lord Chesterfield, and close it by
calling mo a ‘‘ great man,” and protest that you
are right “ to the diamater of a hair.” Surely, sir
the swoon in which you have been lulled, has be
clouded your formerly, very clear vision, and
brought your mental powers under the influence
of some strange hallucination.-Surely, sir, you must
have immersed, and copiously steeped your facul
ties in the Lethean flood, or I never should have
been honoured with your last production. But I
trow you wore not fully awake when you wrote.
Do sir, when you are roused from your next lulla
by, rub the film from your eye before you ven
ture to write. But it may be after all, that these
late compliments of yours are bona fide; and that
they come by way of. reciprocation for a certain
kindness which I had the honour of bestowing
upon you, by showing you to be the exact dupli
cate of old Wouter Van Twiller of New Amster
dam memory. Be that as it may, to be thus com
plimented by such a perfect master of the graces,
and such a prodigium sapientia as yourself, is
certainlv no small matter.
But> what shall I say of the intermediate para
graphs of your last production. They are so cut
ting—so shrewd—so surpassingly witty—so per
fectly killing, that you might think me a “dunce”
again if I should move my pen, or say a word in reply
except—murder! But you will certainly permit
me to call public attention to your surpassing pro
duction. Then let all who wish to learn the per
fect beau-ideal, of all that is smart—shrewd—wit
ty—strong—profound and glowing, in the whole
circle of wit and letters, read your editorial in the
Bib. Recorder of the 1st instant, and if their highest
expectations are not fully met, it will not be your
fault.
I am reminded, sir, that in your first production,
you promised your readers a series of strictures on
my pamphlet. Well the work is done at last.
Your production in question stands at the head of
the whole family of strictures. You there talk of
“witch”—“wizard”—“the black art”—‘‘cabal
istic mysteries”—“dreams”—“visions” &c., &c.
Of course this is a perfect reply to every argument
in my ill-fated pamphlet. Then let Mr. Furman,
who I understand is preparing a formal reply, save
his labor; for this giant of the Recorder has made
short work of it, by hurling upon it, this mountain
of witches, wizards, black-arts, cabalistic myste
ries, dreams, visions, &c.
But seriously, sir, I am astonished at your reluc
tance to proceed with your strictures on my
pamphlet, as you promised. You seem much
more disposed to cavil about unimportant matters
:hau to proceed to the discussion of the principal
joints involved in the controversy. I have called
pour attention to several important points, one of
which is as follows:—“IIow is it that Christians,
who arc unlit for your communion-table will be
recounted fit for heaven?” To this you make but
r passing remark, without attempting to relieve
pour system of the difficulty involved. You sim
jly say : “ perhaps it would be as well, to ask the
reverend gentleman first of all, to prove that what
te wants explained is really a fact.”
Is this the manner in which you give the diffi
tulty the “go by ?” What do you mean sir, by
rsking me to prove that what 1 want explained is
really a fact ? Do you wish me to prove that your
church excludes all Methodists, Presbyterians, &c.,
from your communion-table. That needs no proof;
for every body ‘knows that it is so. Do you wish
me to prove that your Church admits, that the very
Christians whom she thus excludes will be saved 1
This too, is admitted on all hands, so far as I know.
It is true there may bo a few, and for ought I know
you may be among them, who are so tightly bound
up in the old strait jacket of sectarian exclusive
ness and prejudice, as,
“ To deal damnation round the land,”
on all who differ with them on the subject
of baptism ; but if there are such, their num
ber is too small to make an exception to the
general admission. Then, what do you want
me to prove? No sir, you shall not escape in this
way. I hold you to the point, and unpleasant as I
know it must bo to you, I press it upon your con
sideration. Come, my dear sir, none of your ec
centric movements. March up to the question
and relieve your system of the difficulty if you
can. This thing*of close communion is a stum
bling block in the way of hundreds and thousands
of your own members. They cannot see the con
sistency and propriety of excluding all other
Christians from the Lord’s table. Can you not
remove the stumbling block ? Can you not show
to the world that your practice in this particular is
consistent and proper? I press the question. Do,
sir, tell us how it is that Christians, who are unfit
for your communiontable, will be fit to be received
into heaven. 1 shall wait your response ; notify
ing you, in the mean time, that when you have dis
posed of the above question, I have several others
of equal importance to bring to your consideration.
If you please, don’t be quite so witty in your next.
Let us have some argument. A. B. Smith.

THE REPORT OP THE COMMITTEE. OF
THE TEXAS CONFERENCE, ON SEPA
RATION.
The committee to whom were referred certain
acts of the late General Conference, causing and
providing for a division of the Methodist Episco
pal Church, or the General Conference thereof;
and sundry communications pertaining thereto ;
have had the same under solemn and prayerful
consideration, and beg leave to present the follow
ing report.
In view of the numerous expositions and argu
ments pro and con with which the Christian Advo
cates have teemed for some months, on the merits
of the highly important subject upon which your
committee have been called to act; they presume
that the conference is too well enlightened to
need an elaborate and argumentative investigation
of them, in their multifarious relations and bear
ings ; they therefore respectfully present the fol
lowing resolutions, as the result of their delibera
tions.
Resolved, 1st. That we approve of the course of
the Southern and South-western delegates in the
late General Conference ; and that their independ
ent and faithful discharge of duty, in a trying cri
sis, commands our admiration and merits our
thanks.
2nd. That we deeply deplore the increasingly
fearful controversy between tho Northern and
Southern divisions of the Methodist Episcopal
Church outlie institution of domestic slavery, and
that we will not cease to pray most fervently to
the great Head of the church for his gracious in
terposition in guiding this controversy to a happy
issue.
3rd. That we approve the appointment of a con
vention of delegates from the conferences in the
slaveholding States, in the city of Louisville on
the first of May next, by the Southern and South
western delegates in the late General Conference ;
and also the ratio of representation proposed by
said delegates, to wit, one delegate for every ele
ven members of conference, and t hat we will elect
delegates to the proposed convention upon said
basis ; to act under the following instructions, to
wit; To endeavor to secure a compromise be
tween the North and South—to oppose a formal di
vision of the church before the General Confer
ence of 1848, or a general convention can be con
vened to decide the present controversy. But
should a division be deemed unavoidable, and be
determined on by the convention ; then, being well
satisfied with the Discipline of the church, as it is,
we instruct our delegates not to support or favor
any change in said Discipline, by said convention ;
other than to adapt its fiscal economy to the South
ern organization.
4th. That we approve of the dignified and pru
dent course of the bench of Bishops, who presided
in the late General Conference.
5th. That it is the sense of this conference that
the Rev. John Clarke, one of our delegates to the
late General Conference, entirely misrepresented
our views and sentiments in his votes, in the ca
ses of Rev. P. A. Harding and Bishop Andrew.
6th. That we appoint the Friday immediately
preceding the meeting of the proposed general
convention of the delgates of the southern and
South-western conferences, as a day of fasting and
prayer for the blessing of Almighty God on the
said convention—that it may be favored with the
healthful influence of his grace, and the guidance
of his wisdom.

GENERAL INTELLI GEN CE,
FOREIGN.
Wealth of the Mexican nobles.—The wealth of
some of the nobles of Mexico, previous to the revolution
in that country which freed it from dependence in Spain,
(says a modern writer) was equal to that which is now
enjoyed by a great many of the Russian grandees. The
Countof Valenciana was possessed of landed property
of the value of about 829,000,000, besides which he drew
from a single mine an annual revenue of nearly 81,200- J
000.—Their extravagance was as great as their wealth. ]
—The count de Regia, according to Madame de la Bar
ca, was so wealthy, that when his son, the present
Count, was christened, the whole party walked from the
house to the church upon ingots of silver. The Coun
tess, having quarrelled with the Vice Gluccn, serit her,
in token of reconciliation, a white satin slipper, entirely
covered with diamonds. The Count invited the King
ofSpain to visit his Mexican territories, assuring him
that the hoofs of his Majesty’s horse should touch noth
ing but solid silver from Vera Cruz to the capital. This
might be a bravado ; but a more certain proof of his
wealth exists in the fact that he caused two ships of the
line, of the largest size, to be constructed at Havana, at
his own expense, made of mahogany and cedar, and
presented them to the King.
Of course, in the terrible convulsions of which Mexi
co has been the scene, something has been done in the
way of breaking down these wealthy families, but not
so much as might be expected by a person unacquainted
with the facts. Great inequalities mark the social con
dition of the Mexicans. Bustamente, whose name oc
curs so often in accounts from that country, is possessed
of 39G.OOO acres of land, and Santa Anna is reputed to
be very rich. What is called agrarianism, has no sup
porters in Mexico.
Great Britain.—The annual interest upon the debt of
Great Britain is £28,395,000, a sum exceeding one-half
iheprincipal of the Government and Stale debts of the
United States.
The military force of Great Britain consists of three
battallions of guards, cavalry amounting to 6500 rank
and file, and 12 battalions of infantry with a force, rank
and file, 92,500. Of these, there are now 23 battalions
in India, 50 in the Colonics, and 4 ou their passage; be
ing 77 battalions employed in the defence of Colonial
possessions. One battallion, now in India, has been on
foreign service 28 years, and 4 battallions upwards of20
years. «
Sir Robert Peel proposes an increase on the British
Navy of4000men. He says “this increaseof force is not
made for the purpose of war or aggression, but because
our commerce is extending on these coasts, (Africa, Pa
cific and China sea,) and because the exhibition of a
respectable force has a great effect in maintaining
peace.”
Ireland Repeal Association.—At a meeting on
Monday, the 17lh,Mr. John O’Connell criticised Sir
Robert Peel's financial statement—admitting, however,
that it would produce vast benefit to the poorer classes in
Ireland. Bitter complaint was made that the people of
Dublin, and in all quarters, were indifferent ubout the
franchise, and that the conservatives were gaining ma
jorities on the registry.
Mr. O’Connell, in a speech in condemnation of the
land commissioner’s report, described it as the most
exquisite piece of insipidity that ever proceeded from
public men. It was what Cobbct called “cap lap.”
(Laughter.)

The Irish papers, as usual, contain a long list of mur
ders, abductions, ond other outrages.
The Northern Whig states that Dr. Cantwell, Cath
olic Bishop of Meath, has directed his priests to with
hold the sacrament from any person who supports tin
bequest act.
There is no doubt that Dr. Murray will be immedi
ately raised to the rank of Cardinal, to reside at Rome.
France and China.—According to the Revue de Par
is the following are the heads of the treaty concluded by
M. De Lagrenee with the Chinese commissioners at
Macao, on the 34th October last: 1. France is to be
placed on a footing of equality with the most favored
nations as respects customs duties. 3. She is never to
be subjected to the payment of any periodical tribute to
the Sovereign of the Celestial Empire. 3. She may es
tablish a factory at Canton, on the plan of those posses
sed by the English, Dutch, Dantes, Swedes and Span
iards. 4. She will be permitted to trade at Tchang
Tcheou ; reserving the right of the Crown of Spain,
which enjoys a privilege in that city. 5. She may es
tablish factories at Hiamen, Tchaohing and Ningpo.
6. Finally, she will have the right of trading in every
place that may hereafter be opened to the most favored
nations.
A Fatal FolLy.—A foreign journal states that a
fatal duel lately took place at Frankfort, under the fol
lowing circumstances: A young partner in a mercan
tile house, Mr. Kuppenberg, 31 years of age, conduct
ing a young lady home from church, in slippery weather,
gave her his arm. She slipped and fell, notwithstand
ing his support, and an officer of dragoons, chancing to
be walking behind, indulged in a smile at the disaster.
X
Kuppenberg, finding reason for offence in Ihe officer’s
amusement, challenged him the next day. Lnvalette,
the dragoon, refused to fight for such a trifle, but offered
to apologize to the lady, which hs did, on the same
night, nt n hall. The lady, howeqcr, replied that the
account was to be settled with Mr. Kuppenberg, not
with her. and the result of this silly lack of sense and
feeling was the death of the officer, and an almost mor
tal wound to her champion. They fought with pistols,
and Mr. Kuppenberg received a ball in his stomach, of
which he lay dangerously ill at the last accounts. Mr.
Lnvalette wns shot through the neck and died immedi
ately.
The Portland Vase.—Whatever is beautiful in the
arts belongs to every country. A wretched drunkard
in the British Museum broke the celebrated Barbareni
Vase. It was found near Rome in the tomb of Alex
ander Ccverus and his mother Julia, and the Duke of
Portland gave 1000 guineas for it. Its dimensions
were small, being only ten inches high ; its diameter
at the broadest pnrt only six inches. The shape was
elegant. The material, a dark but transparent blue
substance, undoubtedly a vitrified paste or glass. Up
on this the figures, formed of a delicate opaque white sub
stance, are laid in bas-relief, and so firmly united to the
ground-work, that they seem rather to be part of itself
than to be fastened on by art. It is supposed that it
will be repaired. '
Egypt.—The latest advices from Alexandria are to
the 8th of February. The Pasha was at Faioum, and
his son Ibrahim in Lower Egypt, where he is particular
ly engaged in constructing and cleaning canals for the
purpose of irrigation.
Mr. Galloway, the enginerleff for Suez on the 30th
January, by order of the Pasha, forthe purpose of sur
veying and examining the line of route proposed for the
railway, in order to have all necessary estimates and
calculations ready to lay before his highness on his re
turn from Faioum.
DOMESTIC.
Cape Florida.—It is said that the past has been the
coldest winter ever known in this portion of Florida,
but notwithstanding this the fruit trees have not been in
jured or retarded by it. A gentleman, whose planta
tion is at the mouth of the Miama river, has about two
thousand plantain and banana trees, and a great num
ber of orange, lemon and coffee trees, all doing well, and
almost one hundred bunches of bananas are now ready
for use. The lime groves have been unusually produc
tive; and, from the results of every experiment made,
no doubt exists that the fruitsof the tropics may be cul
tivated there with extraordinary success. It is also sta
ted that this portion of the country affords as fine a range
for cotton as can be found in the State, and the Boil and
climate offer every inducement to those desirous of loca
ting in a new country.
Am Springs—The metallic springs which receive und
throw back the form of types on our Napier press, we
have caused to be taken off, and air springs substituted in
their place. The n\etallic springs were ever producing
a heavy jar, and would often break. No metal could
be used und no form of spring adopted, which would
obviate cither difficulty; and the most rapid rate at
which we could drive the press, was 2,400 impressions
per hour. The air springs are only a horizontal cylin
der, which a plunger enters and draws out at every re
volution. The whole machine is nothing but a boy’s
pop-gun with the further end fast closed. We were
surprised last evening to find our press running at*the
rate of fifty impressions a minute, or three thousand an
hour, and that too with no jar or apparent effort of the
machinery, more than the rocking of a cradle.—A'. Y.
Journal o] Commerce.
Sagacity op a Dog.—In a recent fire which de
stroyed the dwelling of Mr. Thompson, in West Ha
ven, he was indebted for the preservation of his own
life and that of his family, to the instinct and fidelity
of his dog. This animal, observing the progress of the
flames, leaped upon the bed where his master was still
asleep and unconscious of danger, and by loud and vo
ciferous bowlings awakened him from his dangerous
slumber, just in time to enable him to escape uninjured
from his burning apartment, and arouse the other in
mates of the house. This is one of the many instances
of sterling attachment and sagacity which plead strong
ly in behalf of the canine species.—New Haven Courier
A Mammoth Machine.—The London Mechanics’
Magazine gives an account of a Hydro-Electrical Ma
chine, of extraordinary power, that is being constructed
in England for the United States. It is said tliut it will
be able to produce a spark of thirty-six inches—to coat
three thouand five hundred feet of metallic surface, in a
battery of forty-eight Leyden jars, to two feet high by
ten inches in diameter. This shock would kill a thou
sand men in an instant, if it were passed through such a
chain. This machine is called the “Benjamin Frank
lin,” and will cost ubour four thousand five hundred
dollars.
*A Goon Book.— Wc understand says the Journal of
Commerce, that a wealthy gentleman called upon Bish
op Onderdonk on Friday, and on taking leave, made him
the present of a book. On taking off the wrapper, and
opening to the title page, there was a hundred dollar
bank note ; on turning over a leaf there was another.; a
third leaf and there was a third bill; over the fourth leaf
a fourth bill, and over the fifth leaf a fifth bill, until it
seemed ns though the book was a volume of hundred
dollar bills.
Ocean Steamers.—TlieNew York Herald saysthere
will be two American steamship lines established in that
city in the course of a few months. One of the lines
will he started into existence by the American Atlantic
Steam Navigation Company, which, some time ago,
obtained a charter from the Legislature of New York.
The other will be formed by one of the existing Livcr
oool packet lines. These two lines will be ready to run
between New York and Liverpool, probably next
spring.
vaeohuia manufacturers,— we are happy to learn
that another lurge factory is to be erected very soon,
the contract for the same having already been comple
ted ; and we cannot doubt that* in the course of o few
years, Columbus will if not coiflpare advantageously
with Lowell, at least have begun the good work in such
a manner as to place beyond conjecture the feasibility of
the South’s manufacturing herown cotton goods, with
out being in the least dependent on her brethren of the
North.— Columbus Bru/uirer.
Steamboat Disasters.—It appears from a report re
cently made by the committee on Naval Affairs to the
House of Representatives, that from the year 1830 to
1840, eighty vessels were lost by explosions of steam
boilers, and that seven hundred and eighty persons were
killed and two hundred and ninety-six wounded by
these disasters. During the same period of time—ten
years—twenty-five vessels were destroyed by fire and
two hundred and fifiy-five lives lost.
Honor to American Genius and Industry.—Mr.
Prescott, the Historian, a native and resident of this
city, was on the 1st of February elected a Correspond
ing Member of the Institute of France. This honor
was never before conferred on any native of New Eng
an d except Franklin.
From Africa.—The barque Palestine, brings among
her passengers Rev. John Seys, superintendent of the
Methodist missions in Liberia, Captain E. H. Johnson,
late of the brig Atlanta, of New York, sold and gone in
to the slave trade, Mr. N. F. Davis, his first officer, and
five seamen.
