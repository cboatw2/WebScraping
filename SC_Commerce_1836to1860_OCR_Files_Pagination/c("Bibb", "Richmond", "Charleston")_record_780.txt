METHODIST COLLEGES.
The day has long gone by. when the Method
ists as. a Church, could, with the least plausi
bility, be charged with a spirit of opposition to
the cause of learning. Whatever may be said
with respect to the qualifications made requisite
, for the ministry, the fact is clear, that no denom
ination of Christians in America, have shown
greater zeal in establishing institutions of learn
ing. Nor are these, for the most part, of a se
condary grade, but in all the facilities for the ac
quisition of solid and valuable knowledge,—for
the cultivation in the most enlarged extent, of the
mind and morals, they will successfully compare
with the oldest and most distinguished of the
land. These colleges have had their origin in
two causes. First, a profound conviction on the
part of the church, of the necessity of a wider
diffusion of education, especially within its own
body ; and secondly, the desire to adopt a sys
tem of education which, while it developed and
enlightened the intellectual powers, should se
cure what was even of higher importance, the
cultivation of the moral principles.
Institutions, deriving their origin from such
motives, it is but just to suppose, would hang
out no false lights; but placing the standard of
scholarship high, would honestly and steadfastly
aim to impart such learning and mental disci
pline as would be liberal, durable, apd useful;
and above all, would, by the example and pre
cept of instructors, as well as by external regu
lation, so discipline and regulate the morals of
youth, as to make them worthy members of so
ciety. Our Methodist colleges aspire to nothing
which can be merely intended for display. They
adopt no form or regulation for the mere purpose
of ostentation or tinsel glitter. This is contrary to
the spirit of their origin. Indeed, this may be
the cause that their patronage has never been
commensurate with the solid advantages they
> propose. For, even in the important matter of
education, man will be captivated and deluded by
the specious glare which may be thrown around
it. And it is not to be denied, that in most insti
tutions of the country, many strenuous efforts I
are employed, much time is consumed, much
funds wasted, that furnish no durable advanta
ges, but are employed for the sole purpose of
\ winning influence and securing eclat.
So earnest has been the desire to furnish our
1 institutions with every facility for securing those
objects in which we stated they have had their
origin, that even in their location, these objects
were primarily and chiefly had in view. It has
ever been a prominent objection to most of the
collegiate institutions of the land, that their loca
tions were such as to environ the youth connec
ted with them, with scenes and circumstances
tending to retard mental improvement, and to en
danger moral principle. The founders of our
own institutions, taught by experience and ob
servation, sought to avoid this evil by the selec
tion, in most instances, of locations remote from
all seductive objects; and thus fixing them
where tranquillity and undisturbed attention
might be enjoyed, have left instructors untram
melled, and the youth unseduced in the pursuit
of their great and noble objects. Devoted then,
as these institutions are, to the spread of sound
learning, with special reference to the proper
' training and direction of the morals ; located in
8U1UUHUU5 smutuuiis, unu reuioio ironi an cir
cumstances tending- to divert attention from le
gitimate pursuits,—these, it would appear to so
ber minds, are the institutions meriting patronage.
It is needless, at this late day, to argue the
propriety of connecting moral, with intellectual
training. The reflecting portion of even the ir
religious world freely admit that all systems of
education arc defective, which exclude a special
provision for the cultivation of the morals.—
Why, then, is there not a more general patron
age of these institutions? Why will such be
preferred by any parent, which, while they pre
sent no more enlarged opportunities for intellec
tual improvement, furnish no guaranty for the
preservation of the morals ? Is it believed, that
because these institutions are under Methodist di
rection, undue efforts will be employed to change
denominational prepossessions ? Let it be un
derstood, that while the most zealous exertions
will be used, to guard the morals of the taught;
to inspire with a sense of religious responsibility;
to convert them to God; no sectarian influence
will be employed to secure them to the Method
ist communion. Such a course would contra
dict their own declarations, and be repugnant to
their best interests. Indeed, our Methodist col
leges are not sectarian in any sense in which
that term is hateful. Whatever may be the ef
forts of instructors in our colleges to induce a
proper consideration of the claims of Christianity,
the minds of the youth are left free to embrace or
otherwise, the religion of Christ, and if embra
ced, to make, unbiassed by authority, or the arts
of the sectarian, a selection of that denomination
most in harmony with their feelings. The fact,
4*that these institutions are controlled by a partic
ular denomination of Christians, has greatly
misled the minds of many in relation to their in
ternal plan of operations; who, if properly in
formed, we can but believe, would avail them
selves of their many and rare advantages. The
most dissolute mar^,prefers to place his son where
the power of sinful temptation is least felt, and
where his associations conspire to lead him in
the paths ol virtue.
But why should not Methodists give to these
institutions their hearty and zealous support? It
is true, that, for the most part, their patronage is
bestowed upon them. But, does not the relation
they sustain to them, impose further obligations?
All Methodists have a property in these institu
tions. They belong to the body of which they
are members. They were established primarily
for their benefit; and their prosperity and ad
vancement, are intimately connected with the
honour as well as welfare of the Church. Be
sides their yielding-them their patronage, are not
Methodists under powerful obligations to employ
theif best efforts in advancing, in its widest sense,
their interests, by pecuniary support, when re
quisite ; by assiduously, on all proper occasions,
urging their claims upon the consideration of the
people; and by the constant eifiployment, indi
vidually, of every legitimate effort for the en
largement of their patronage? It has been be
fore remarked, that a want of true information
on the part of many in relation to the internal con
duct of these institutions, has been the true cause
of their failure to yield them their support. Me
thodists have been criminally backward in diffu
sing proper light upon this subject. Upon the
laity as well as ministers, the duty devolves to
correct this evil.
JYlethodists have a deep interest in These insti
tutions. For, if properly supported, they have a
surety that, in all coming time, whatever maybe
the changes in the educational system elsewhere,
or however much other institutions of the land
may depart from the true standard of propriety
and rectitude; they may have seats of learning of
the highest grade, subject to their own control,
in which their sons and daughters may be trained
consistently with their own views and senti
ments. There will ever be an assurance, that
the business of education upon which their chil
dren’s welfare so much depends, will be con
ducted on those principles alone of which they
approve.
There is another view which may be present
ed, which will render still more impressive, the
obligation to support such institutions, and the
precious interest the Church holds in them.—
They are the fountains of liberal education to
the rising ministry. Without entering into a
consideration at this time, of the expediency or
inexpediency of following the example of our
Weslevan brethren, and originating and endow
ing Theological Schools, it is enough to say,
that the present policy of the Church provides no
other system of preparatory scholastic instruc
tion for her ministry, than that which is to be
found in her halls of literary and scientific learn
ing. The importance then, of securing these
advantages as fully as possible, so that the num
ber of well-educated and thoroughly disciplined
ministers may be indefinitely increased, is stri
kingly obvious. Indeed, I doubt not, but that a
good Providence has looked mainly to this im
portant object, in opening the way for the origi
nation of Methodist Colleges on the ample scale
in which they are now found throughout our
country. Young as they are, already they have
sent forth a large number of educated preachers.
Most of these are now to be found in the itinerant
ranks, and by their zeal and efficiency have de
monstrated that their commission is from on
high. If these colleges be properly supported
and are conducted with Christian spirit, we
doubt not, that from this source alone, the minis
try. will eventually embrace much of the talent
and learning which its interests demand. Annu
ally will be sent forth educated young men, burn
ing with Christian zeal, and actuated by the high
purpose ofdevotingalltothe causeoftheir Master.
From this view alone a high and peculiar im
portance attaches to these institutions. In every
aspect in which they may be considered, so great
and valuable is the good they are competent to
bestow, that to sustain and advance them, Me
thodists should regard it a high and sacred duty.
They stand out prominently among the institu
tions of the land, and yielding to none in all the
facilities for preparing youth for manhood, merit
the favourable attention of the whole country. J

CHURCH PROPERTY,—BANNER OP THE
CROSS.
Mr. Editor,—In looking over your paper, of
the 23d June, an editorial under the words,—
“ Methodist Church Property,” arrested my at
tention. I know something, from the nature of
the case, of the delicacy of your position in rela
tion to your brother editors, and especially as a
Christian minister; and can, therefore, account
for the leniency of the epithets,—“ wonderful—
amazing "—which you applied to Dr. Coleman,
for penning the remarks which are animadverted
upon. That any man, Christian, or no Chris
tian, in this country, where the Discipline of our
Church,—which contains its rules, and usages,
and doctrines, is so widely disseminated, should
venture the assertions which Dr. Coleman has
ventured, betrays a degree of ignorance, which
can be accounted for only by regarding it as hav
ing sprung from that deep depravity of the hu- i
man heart which is reckless alike of truth, and I
its author. I can well conceive of ignorance,
upon this subject, in a man who has not had op- ]
portunities to inform himself, or having opportu
nities, has not availed himself of the information
which an improvement of these opportunities
might impart to him; but the case of a man, who,
from his position in life, and professions to the
world, betraying ignorance,—utter ignorance,
upon the very points with which he not only
professes to be, but is positively informed, is suen
a departure from right conduct, and such an as
persion upon the Christian character, that we do
violence to our feelings to impute it to even the
most abandoned of the race ; and yet, Dr. Cole
man has subjected himself to just such imputa
tion. Startling, however, as is his position, I
regard it as but the carrying forward of princi
ples which were conceived, and acted upon, to
the intellectually blinding, and destruction of
thousands, in darker ages.
There is, naturally, such a congeniality be
tween the human mind and truth, that truth
stripped of the glosses and falsities with which its
enemies invest it, needs but to be presented, and
the mind receives it as truth. This disgraceful
scrambling, therefore, which is now going on in
some of the so-called Christian Churches, not to
promulgate the truths of the Gospel,—not “ to
preach Jesus and him crucified,” but, for usages
and denominational forms, which have the least
possible bearing upon the great purpose for
which Christ came into the world, I regard, and
I cannot, as an honest .nan, regard it otherwise,
as a work directly from the Devil. If we must
difler as to the most efficient means for the pro
i.
mulgation of the paramount truths of the Gospel;
and if also, we naturally differ as to the means
by which the recipients of those truths are to be
kept within their proper spheres, why, in all con
science, let us differ, but yet let us differ chari
tably. What matters it with a true patriot, who
fought the battle, if the victory, achieving the lib
erty. ofhis country, be gained ? and what matters
it with a true Christian, what forms were used,
if souls are saved, if Heaven be gained? The
ultimate end of Christianity, all professing Chris
tians are agreed upon; the cardinal doctrines of
the Cross, which constitute the foundation of the
means which, in the wisdom of God, are to ac
complish this end, are also, in like manner,
agreed upon; and if, as we naturally may do,
we differ as to minor points, or rather human
means, which are to be instruments in the {land
of God, in the evangelization of the world, let us
be charitable enough, (andhow can we. do other
wise as Christians ?) to regard this difference as
an honest difference. Let us, then, cease this
unchristian and disgraceful scrambling fox mat
ters which are non-essential; let us be done with
this vile practice of slandering each other about
eaeh other’s forms,—non-essential as they are;
jind in commenting upon these forms before the
world, let us, for God’s sake, for the common
cause of Christianity itself, present them, what
ever they may be,truthfully; andlet m,—I call,
upon Christian denominations of every name,——
rally around the cardinal truths of the Gospel,
about which there is no dispute, and which,
whenever they are presented,—divested of the
denominational rancor with which, not a few of
the present day are wont to invest their promul
gation, are sure to produce the effect upon man
kind which their Great Author intended they
should produce.
ii iiuu me zeai, ii oan tne time, it Half the In
tellectual effort, which have been spent upon
contentions for religious forms and ceremonies
that are in no way essential to salvation, had
been directed, in obedience to the heavenly com
mand, to the great work of “preaching the Gos
pel to every creature,” the world, long since,
would have been evangelized,—the standard of
the Cross would have waved over all lands.
Thpmiraculous progress of Christianity, un
der the preaching of the Apostles, is attributable
solely to their unity of action, and concentration
of purpose, in the promulgation of its truths. “ I
count all things but loss for the excellency ofthe
knowledge of Christ Jesus,” was eminently their
watch-word. Their lives, their fortunes, their
characters among men—nay, all that attached to
them as men, they regarded only so far as these
enabled them to advance the conquests of the
Redeemer’s kingdom. And behold the result 1
The kingdoms of darkness gave way ; the igno
rance of ages as to the true God, and the destiny
of man, was dispelled at once; and the sound of
salvation from sin by faith in a divine Redeemer,
went out into all the earth. The Apostles’ God
is our God; the Apostles’ cause is our cause;
man then, is man still j and the same means
used now, with the same singleness of purpose
and earnestness of heart which characterized the
preaching of the Apostles, under the influence of
the same Holy Spirit, would, unquestionably,
produce the same glorious results at this day._
Why, then, should there be such a noise and
stir, about mere ceremonies, and details of eco
nomic policy.
“ Whate’er is best administer’d, is best.”
In conclusion, I would say to those who real
ly wish to become acquainted with our economy,
as a church,—read the Discipline of the M. E.
Church, and regard such doctrines, and usages
only, as are therein set forth, as peculiar to
us. This is charity,—it is the spirit of the “ gol
den rule.’! We know, and not without pain,
that many even among ourselves, from their vio
lations of our Discipline, in matters under their
cognizance, have given ground for erroneous
inferences as to the usages of our church; but
yet we believe that no Christian will settle him
self upon a conclusion as to either our Faith or
Government, without having first informed him
self, upon these points, from the proper source.
As a church, we believe that the usages and doc
trines recognized in our Discipline as peculiar
to us, are sufficient for all the purposes of faith
and practice ; nor do we, nor can we, as a Chris
tian people, blame others for differing from us,
in regard to either. We wish people to mind
their own business, and regard the end upon
which we all are agreed, and not waste their en
ergies upon contentions which tend to anything
else than its accomplishment. Neither do we
claim perfection in anything emanating from us
as human. As arrogant as some people are, to
front the world with pretensions to exclusive
church privileges, assuming to be the sole de
scendant from the Apostolic Church, we, are as
sured from the success with which God has bless
ed our labours in His cause, that we have all the
requisites of a true Church, are content.to con
tinue doing His bidding, as is our wont. And
yet, when self-defence compels us, we repel such
calumnies as are thrown upon us by the “ Ban
ner of the Cross.” We have intentionally avoid
ed saying a word as to what our usages are, in
contradistinction from what the Editor of that
print asserts to be “ facts,” as those usages are
plainly set forth in our Discipline,and especially as
the Rev. Dr. himself, from his former position in
life, must havfr known the truth in the premises.
A Methodist.
Abbeville, June 26, 1843.
THE SOCIETY ISLANDS.
The Courier des Etats Unis remarks, that there
is a great difference between Admiral Dupetit
Thouars’ occupation of the Marquesas and the
Society Islands,—“ uncultivated, almost uninhab
ited, upon which has not penetrated yet the civ
ilization of Europe,”—and the seizure of the
Sandwich Islands, which have so long been
open to civilization, and which have made such
rapid progress. The Sandwich Islands, it adds,
like France, the United States and Great Britain,
have their churches, their schools, their juries
and their parliamentary government, which the
English have seized upon, while France has only
taken rocks, which she is transforming into asy
lums for all the navies of the world.
In regard to the Marquesas, we might admit
the essential correctness of the Courier’s descrip
tion ; but the case of the Society Islands, in
which (as Admiral Thouars, ha3 done) we in
clude the Georgian Islands, is very different.
These Islands, so far from being “ rocks,” are
exceedingly fertile and productive. If they are
in a measure “ uncultivated,” it is because, as in
Eden, the most valuable productions grow spon
taneously, without the aid of human labouT
Murray s Encyclopedia of Geography says
“ The Society Islands have excited a higher in
terest than any other group in the South Seas
Though not the largest, they are the most beau
tiful, and those- in which civilization and polish
ed manners have made the greatest progress
They are those with which Europe has held the
most close and intimate connexion.” The words
which we have printed in italic, correct another
error of the Courier. In point of civilization,
the Society Islands are scarely, if at all, behind
the Sandwich Islands. Like the latter, they
abound with churches, schools and other marks
of civilization. In 1813, according to Worces
ter, “ there were in Otaheite, Elmeo, <fcc. 66
places of public worship.” And the number has
probably increased since. In 1819 a royal
chapel was completed at Otaheite, 712 feet long,
by 54 wide, with three pulpits, 200 feet from each
other, and capable of accommodating 6000 per
sons. At its dedication this number of persons
were actually within its walls. The Broadway
Tabernale could accommodate but about half a
many. And then, as to public morals, which
are one of the bests tests of civilization, since a
good state of public morals always implies civ
ilization, either as cause or effect, or both, the
following remarks occur in the journal of Rev.
1 Tyerman, who, with another gentleman,
was delegated by the London Missionary Society,
about 20 years ago, to visit the various mission
ary stations. Speaking of the Society Islands,
and more particularly of Otaheite, he says,—
j" MiMituiaiuy ur muecency is seen.
A.I1 drunkenness and profane swearing are un
known here. All their former sports and amuse
mcnts are completely put down. Never before
did the Gospel obtain so complete and so univer
sal a triumph, in any country, over heathenism,
cruelty, superstition and ignorance.” At Hua
heine, one of the Society Islands proper, contain
ing about 2000 inhabitants, the schools in 1823
contained 1058 scholars, including 700 adults.
About 600 adults had been baptized, in that small
population, and 350 children. In Raiatea anoth
er of said Islands, containing 1500 inhabitants,
about 1000, at the date above mentioned, were
accustomed to assemble for public worship; and
including children, had been baptized.
“ Much attention,” says Chapin’s Gazetteer,
speaking of this island, “is given to the educa
tion of old and young.” Nearly the same state
of things existed in the other islands. But it is
unnecessary to go into particulars. Our object
is simply to show, that far from being unciviliz
ed, the inhabitants of those islands, so uncere
moniously taken possession of by France, are
both civilized and christianized; in many re
spects surpassing the people of France and the
United States. ^
The Courier presents, as another point of
contrast, the long time that the Sandwich Islands
have been “ open to civilization.” But not near
so long as the Society Islands have. In the
former, idolatry was not abandoned till 1819,
and the first missionaries landed there in the fol
lowing year. At Otaheite, on the contrary,
missions were established so long ago as 1797 ;
and idolatry was completely abolished in 1815!
Numerous buildings were immediately erected
for Christian worship, and schools', in every dis
trict, amounting to upwards of 60 in this one is
land. In June, 1816, one of the missionaries
wrote, “ All accounts agree that a most wonder
ful change has been produced in all the Society
Islands; and the spread of the Gospel seems to
be almost universal.”
^ At Eimeo, the other principal island of the
Georgian group, # civilization and Christianity
made considerable progress before idolatry gave
way in Otaheite. And, according to Murray's
Encyclopedia of Geography, it “ is still the
centre of that European and Christian civiliaa
sion which originated there. It contains the
South Sea Academy, a printing office and a cot
ton factory.
The population of the Society Islands is un
doubtedly less than that of the Sandwich group;
but still, it must amount to 30,000 or 40,000, par
ha ps more. And suppose it were but 10,000;
vvliat right would this give to France, or any
other nation, to rob them of their independence?
No other right but the power of the strongest;
which is the same right that an armed highway
man exercises upon the unarmed traveller when
he robs him of his purse. It is a disgrace to
France, and to the age in which we live, that she
should thus have taken advantage of the physi
cal weakness of the Islanders. It was her ex
ample, wc have no doubt, added to the expecta
tion that she would play the same trick at the
Sandwich Islands, which has induced England
provisionally to take possession of the latter, un
til their independence can be secured, as it soon
dp, Dy me joint acknowledgment of the
principal nations of Europe and America. It is
plain that these Islands had a narrow escape
from falling into the hands of France. Nothing
probably prevented it but the fact that an embassy
from the Sandwich Islands was on its way to
France, England, and the U. Satets, for the pur
pose of securing an acknowledgment of their
independence. A French ship, the Embuscade,
Capt. Mallet, had actually proceeded to Hono
lulu, “to demand reparation for the irijuries in
flicted on the French,” but was prevented from
[ proceeding to extremities by the fact above men
I tioned. . It is but three or four years since asig
i nal satisfaction for “injuries” was exacted by
I France, the Islanders being compelled under
threats of a bombardment to pay money, salute
I the French flag, admit Popery and Brandy free
; of duty, and we know not what besides. A new
j batch of“ injuries,” it appears, has since accrued,
| —but England had suffered still greater injuries,
—so great, in fact, that nothing but a surrender
! of the Islands could atone for them. Thus the
I ambition of one powerful nation is countervailed
! by that of another powerful nation, and between
j them both, there is a fair chance that the really
injured party may be restored to the enjoyment
of its rights. Heaven grant that it may be so.—

I
I MIRACLES OF MOSES.
| No reflection forced itself upon me so often or
i so urgently, in passing over the track of the Is
i raelites, as the utter and universal inaptitude of
this country for the sustenance of animal life.
It really seems to possess no' elements favorable
to human existence besides a pure atmosphere,
and no appearances favor the supposition that it
was ever essentially better. I am filled with
wonder that so many travellers should task their
ingenuity to get clear of the miracles which, ac
cording to the narrative of Moses, were wrought
to facilitate the journey of that vast, unwieldy
host, when it is demonstrable that they could not
have subsisted three.days in this desert without
supernatural resources. The extensive region,
through which we were twelve day3 in passing
on dromedaries, is, and ever must have been, in
capable of affording food sufficient to support
even a few thousand, or a few hundred people for
a month in the year. There is no corn-land or
pasturage,—no game nor roots,—hardly any
birds or insects, and the scanty supply of water
is loathsome to the taste, provoking rather than
appeasing thirst. What could the two millions
of Israel have eaten without the miracles of the
manna'and the quails? How could they have
escaped destruction by drought but for the heal
ing of the waters of Mara ?—a miracle that was
probably repeated in Wady Gerundel, and at
the other salt wells on their route to Sinai. So
of the transit of the Red Sea: had they continu
ed their route around the Gulf of Suez, it is
manifest that a few thousand well appointed
troops could have cut them up upon their march,
and rendered their escape impossible, unless a
miracle in some other form had been interposed
for their protection and deliverance. A greater
prodigy would it have been than any, or all, al
Iedged to have been wrought for their salvation,
if two millions of men, women, and children,
unarmed, servile, and destitute had succeeded in
escaping from Egypt in the face of a powerful
and well-provided enemy, and in effecting their
march through that barren waste,—a route im
practicable by the best disciplined army, aided
by the resources of great and wealthy nations.
'-'“e ui me cniei uimcuiucs wnicn i meet with
in the narrative of Moses is that of accounting
for the subsistence of the numerous herds ana
flocks that belonged to the retreating host. We
hear of no miraculous provision for their support,
and it seems incredible that they could have sub
sisted upon the scanty verdure afforded by the
flinty soil of the desert, after making all possible
allowance for its deterioration by the physical
changes of three thousand years. They were
probably much less numerous than we are ac
customed to suppose from the very general and
indefinite language used in the Bible upon this
[subject; and they were undoubtedly dispersed
' over the whole region lying between the long
range of mountains now known as Jebel Raha
and Jebel Tih on the east, and the Red Sea on the
west. This might easily have been done, as the
country seems not to have been peopled, and the
march between Suez and the neighborhood of
Sinai was unmolested by enemies. The stations
and encampments enumerated in the thirty-third
chapter of Numbers were the head quarters,
while many of the people must always have
been separated from the main body of the host,
seeking food for their flocks of sheep and cattle
in the neighboring valleys.
From the South-Western Christian Advocate.
SLAVE-HOLDING BISHOPS.
We copied, last week, an article from the
Southern Christian Advocate, under the above
caption, in which a few things are offered to the
consideration of the southern conferences of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, touching the elec
tion of slave-nolding bishops. We agree with the
l writer, first, that several additional superinten
dents should be elected at the ensuing General
Conference. The work, which is constantly
enlarging, is already too great for the present
number of bishops, admitting that they were all
able to render efficient service. And while we
are far from wishing to make the office of bishop
a sinecure, we are equally opposed to laying un
reasonable burdens on the shoulders of our super
intendents. We musthaveadditional strength in
this department of the work at the next General I
Conference. !
That any reasonable objection does exist to I
the election of a slave-holder, who is in every j
other way qualified for the office we cannot pos
siblv see. While our brethren of the non-slave- i
holding states concede that our preachers in the
south are good men, good ministers, called of j
God to preach, administer the ordinances, and !
sit with them in general council, we think it
strange that they should proscribe them in the
office of the general superintendency, which is
not an order, but only an office, in the Church
of God. That abolitionists should object, we
i are prepared to expect, for many of them alrea
! dy declare non-fellowship with all who are con
| nected in anywise with slavery, and send all to
l perdition headlong, who hold or sanction the
j holding of slaves. These we expect always to
proscribe the south, and they would, if in their
| power, rend the church, and walking off with
i tne spoils, send masters and servants to destruc
| lion, nor would they regret the speedy misery of
| both, so that their fanatical and ambitious ends
were accomplished. This we believe to be the
spirit of many of their leaders, however charity
might lead us to throw the veil of pity over those
who may be the dupes of ignorance and preju
dice. We never expect the southern church to
find sympathy in the breasts of fanatical Aboli
tionists. We leave such to the tender mercies of |
Horton, Scott, &. Co. We do think, however, j
that our anti-abolition brethren in the non slave
holding states, ought to rise in their majesty, and
put an end to all further disputations in this mat
ter. They should allow their brethren of the
south equal privileges with themselves, other
things being equal, or let us know at once the
ground we are to occupy from this time hence
forth ; and if proscription is to be the order, in
future, as heretofore' practised, we should
know it.
To say, however, that we are ready to adopt
a diocesan episcopacy, we cannot. To our mind
there are serious objections to this plan ; and we
would think long, and weigh well such a pro
ject, before we could incline to it. One of the
peculiar glories of Methodism is her Itinerancy,
and to carry out this great system effectually, we
look upon a general superintendency as a sine
qua non. It was so considered by the framers
of our Discipline; and hence in the restrictive
rules it is said, the General Conference “ shall
not change or alter any part of our government,
so as to do away episcopacy, or destroy the plan
of our itinerant general superintendency."
We think the direct tendency of a diocesan
episcopacy is to Congregationalism ; and how
ever this plan of government may meet the views
and answer the purposes of Congregationalists,
we opine it will never suit Methodist economy.
The avowed object of Methodism is “ to spread
Scripture holiness and what, we ask, can so
effectually disseminate the doctrines of holiness
as our itinerancy 1—our itinerancy led on by a
general superintendency ?
.V , * I- - .
We have witnessed the comparative failure
of every faction that slabbed of! from the M. E.
Church. We have seen the imbecility of those
plans adopted in this country, intended to carry
out our purposes, where a general superinten
dency has been disregarded. They have all
utterly failed, while Methodism, under Qbd, has
held on her way with increasing prosperity.
And what has more conduced to this prdsperity
than the annual visitations of our wise, pious,
faithful, devoted, self-sacrificing bishops, who
have always been the vanguard of Methodism,
going in the front of our armies, and encounter
ing the hottest of the battle. ? Whatever of labor,
toil, sacrifice, or suffering is endured, by our
itinerant preachers, in these things our bishops
are more abundant than any of their brethren.
Traversing the whole continent, and familiariz
ing themselves with every portion of the work :
entering into the views, feelings, and prejudices 4
of every section of the work, they have served as
a bond of union to hold together the vast armies
of Methodism, and thus to present in unbroken
columns the forces of our Emmanuel, in such a
lightas has never been any where else witnessed
in Protestant Christianity. We say then, that
we should solemnly regret any circumstance
that might in the least degree change this fea
ture of Methodism, or render it necessary to de
stroy the unity of the church.
We can at present think of but four plans,
one of which must obtain.
1. Uur brethren of the non-slave-holdin g states
must concede the point, and in the election of
superintendents, make slavery no. question what
ever^ but must elect to the office such men as in
the judgment of the General Conference are
qualified, irrespective of the slave question. And
this we think in all conscience thev ought to
do. Or, J 6 -
2. A division line must be drawn, constituting
a northern and a southern church, allowing each
to elect their own general superintendents._
This the true friends of Methodism would sorely
regret. Or,
3. The plan of districting the work, as pro
posed by “ Efastus,” must be adopted, which
cannot be done, in our judgment, without first
complying with the 6th article in the “ Restric- '
tive Rules.” Or,
4. The southern church, for the sake of the
peace and unity of Methodism, must submit, as
they always have done, to those restraints thrown
upon them by their brethren, and choose rather
to thus suffer the wrong inflicted upon them than
to -rend the body of the church.
We are aware that these are delicate ques
tions, and should be handled with the utmost
caution ; and should our brethren here, or in the
more southern portion the church, see fit to
investigate these points, we trust they will pro
ceed with that calmness and sweetness of Chris
tian temper that will insure a proper decision
under the guidance ofthe Spirit of Christ. On
any account let us not imitate the madness and
folly of northern fanatics.
THE SAILOR’S TEXT—‘I WANT A CHART.’
I was one day standing in the shop of my
master, behind the counter, when an old sailor
entered, and looking seriously at me, accosted
me thus: ‘Young man, I want a chart?’—
‘Yes, sir,’ I replied, ‘you shall have one; do
you want St. George’s, the Bay of Biscay, or
round Ireland, or the Meditterranean, sir?’
‘Stay, young man, stay !’ said the old sailor ;
‘ youth is always in a hurry. I want a chart,
but I don’t want either one you have mentioned:
they are useless tome. I want a chart which
shall guide me to heaven, for I have lost my old
one. Now, young man, do you understand
me ?’
I immediately conjectured .that he wanted a
Bible; so I took down a few, and showed them
to him ; when he selected one, evidently much
pleased at my readiness to serve him; inquired
the price, and paid the money. After a few
moments’ pause, he turned round suddenly, and
asked me whether I understood that chart ? I
told him that I could read it, and did so very
often. ‘ Of that,’ said the old man, ‘ I have not
the least doubt; but recollect,' that is not suffi
cient : you must have it in your life and conver
sation, before you will receive any benefit; you
must love this chart; you must make it your
sole guide through life’s maze • and, in entering
into the dark, and narrow, and, to many thou
sands, dreadful strait of death, you will find it
beneficial—then it will be found indeed a trea
sure and joy.—London. Pilot.

THE BETTER CHOICE.
A quaker, residing at Paris, was waited on By
four workmen, in order to make their compli- .
ments, and ask for their usual new year’s gifts
“ Well, my friends,” said the quaker, “ here
art your gifts; choose fifteen francs, or the Bi
ble.” “ l don’t knowhow to read,” said the first,
“ so I take the fifteen francs.”
“ I can read,” said the second, “ but I have
pressing wants.” He took the fifteen francs.—
The third also made the same choice. He now
came to the fourth, a lad of about thirteen or four
teen years. The quaker looked at him with an,
air of goodness.
“ Will you, too, take these three pieces, which
you may attain at any time by your labor and •
industry!” -
“ As you say the book is good, I will take it,
and read it to my mother,” replied the boy. He
took the Bible, opened it, ana found between the
leaves a gold piece of forty francs.
The others hung down their heads, and the -
quaker told them he was sorry they had not made
a better choice.
FEAR OF DEATH.
Among the Chinese, the fear of death is dis
tressing. Their imagination has invented no
fewer than ten hells. One is stuck full of knives;
another an iron boiler full of scalding water;
another of cold ice; in another, the punishment
consists in pulling out the tongue; another is full
of poisonous serpents; in another the victim is
drawn to pieces; another is a hell of blackness
and darkness. You may hear them praying—.
“May I not fall into the nell of sworas—of ser
pents—of boiling water,” &c. I bring this for
ward to show that, to some extent, they are cry
ing out," What shall I do to be saved?” Is there
one here who will refuse to say, “ Exert your
selves to the utmost to carry the gospel to every
creature?"—-Rev. Dr. Morrison.
