Tic takes pleasure in stating tliat lie has
made use of this P AN' A- JK A, siiccessful'y in n case
of S< rofula, which he has been afflicted with more
than Tunes vears. On several occasions he applied
to practical Physicians for aid, t North and South,)

upon hy numerous acquaintances, to try the
virt le of certain R*)OTS and HERBS; and believing,
'hat the Rceipt would greatly benefit him,
he took it, togethe* with an old French Receipt: from
which is manufactured the VEGETABLE PANACEA.
It is proper here to sav, that the quality of some,
or Dili the rrinrip.il Roots, are well known to the
Medical Faculty, by whom they arc frequently used.
For Scrofula or King's Evil, Ulcerated Sores,
general diseases of the BLOOL), or the effects of
Mercurv ; it has a decided salutarv efTect
For Uowf.i. Complaint he would also recommend
the use of the VEGrE TABLE PA X ACEA. <Niildren
are frequently attacked wi?h this complaint :
especially when teething. A few doses ol the PANACEA
will check the Bowels, and they become regular
again. It has heen tried by a great number of
respectable individuals, and pronounced a "certain
cure." Me lias tried it at difiereut times in his own
family, and it relieved the child immediately.
This Medicine is simple in Us operations; an<f has
a pleasant taste.
Give it a trial, and judge its worth.

Pinacea at the different Orog Stores throughout

F. S. BRONSON. 1
IT is with great pleasure the subscriber informs
the public that he has completed the mixture oi
the VEGETABLE! ELIXIR. This medicine is 1
composed of Roots which grow in this State. It is
useless to enter into a detail of the value of this Medicine,
(or any other Root medicine,) as it is well
known that all Roots have valuable Medical pro[icrlies.
He would also state that there is not the
cast danger in the use ol the Elixir. For the following
named diseases, there is no medicine made or
vended at the present time, better calculated to relieve
the aillirted, than the Vegetable Elixir.
For Rheumatism and Consumption, the Elixir
should be used internally and externally.
For Dyspepsia or Dysury, he would also recommend
the use ot the h.Lixir, as he feels confident
it will prove highly beneficial to those who use it.
To those who are alllcted with Pustules, Eruptive
Distempers, and Venereal diseases, lie particularly
recommends the use of the VEGETABLE ELIXIR.
Without the fear of contradiction, he recommends this
Medicine as the best now in us??as it has pToved
successful in every ease in which it has been used.

PATENT OTTON GUV. p
rV\llISGin can be made double, or single. If ei
9 made double, they reduce lubor, and gin just
double, the quantity of cotton over the single cylin- '
der Gin, no other knd having been in ns*e prevous
to this patent; nnd whether single or double, they "
are found to improve the quality of the cotton, by ?
more perfectly cleaning it. They can he made to
contain from 20 to KiOsaws in a stand, and whether
small or large, one band will be sufficient to attend ,,
tliem. The Gins have mechanical feeders and 1
noppers attached to them, which free the cotton
from leaves, trnsh, dirt. iVc before it can icach the
saws, and by the thorough hackling operation it
receives from the feeders, which make two revolutions
to one of the saws, it is almost in a half *
gined state, before it descends to the saw By a
very simple arrangement of a screw to each set of
gaates, on which the hoppers rest, and through
which the teeth of the feeders pass, they can he *
made to teed slow or fast to suit the condition of
the cotton at (he time. When made double, the
saws are placed on two sets of cylinders and turn *'
upon each other in opposite directions, and are
cleansed by two sets ot brushes that have four revo- *
lutions to one of twe saw. The two cylinders can
be detached so as to enable the planter to run one
or both at pleasure, although embraced with feeders. *
&c. in one stand. The whole is put in operation
with a drum and band, as in the ordinary Gin, and
may be propelled by horse, steam, or water power.
It mny also be propelled by iron running gear.!
The torce required to work it, is about the same as ^
that necessary to move an equal number of saws in !
the common Gin. This Gin has been put in
operation in New Orleans tor two or three weeks,
and its success tested in the presence of a large
number of planters, merchants and others, and
received their general approbation ;
Several gentlemen have been ho kind as to give j
the Patentee their written opinion icspecting the ,
merits of the Gin. A number of others could be
added, l\ut the following are deemed sufficient: j 01

Dr A. Jones?Dear Sir, in reply to your note,
nccoinpantca oy a specimen of the cotton, ginned
by your Patent Gin, I beg leave to observe, that it
exhibits a dccid< d improvement on the usual process
of ginning ; delivering the staple uninjured
and free from nap or trash, clean and of goed co-.
lor ; thereby giving the article on additional value.
These fnvoutble impressions of the advantages of
your Patent Gin, huve been confirmed by subsequently
w itne.-sing it in operation. The utility of
the double cylinders and saving of labor, will ho
readily perceived and properly appreciated by the
ntelligenl planter.
l-eeling a deep interest in the success of all improvements
tending to benefit the important staples
>f our country, 1 trust that yours will meet with
he encourngcuu nt it justly merits.

Dr. A Jo es?Dear Sir, in nnswei tc your inqui y
of my opinion of your Patent Cotton Gin, I
teg leave to state, that 1 was fifteen years c-11 gored
in the cotton factories ol Manchester. Engand,
and during four years of that time, 1 was
brenuui in the house ol Messrs. Lewis, 'W illiams
1- Co., and near five years spinner in the house of
Vlessrs. Sandford A Gnene. 1 have seen your
Jotton Gin in operation, and have examined the
:otton ginned by it, and pronounce it better cleaned,
and ihc staple less injured, than any cotton
hat ever came unde r my observation. It is ccmtletely
reao'y for the breaker without the aid of Iho
(lower, and would, therefore, save the first process
n manufacturing the article. I consider cotton
leansed by your Gin, would command from one
o two cents on the pound more than the average
rops brought into the Manchester market, and
leansed by common Gins Yours, very iesp'lv
