% . most fprtuuate when the public .funds were
received, 4ind themselves most embarrassed
when the season of payment suddenly arrives.
* Unfortunately, too* the evils of the system
. are not lior.ted to. the. banks - It .stimulates
4 general rasfiness of en'erprise, and aggraJ
vates the .fluctuations of commerce and the
? ? currerfcy. This result was strikingly exhibited
during the operations of the late
* deposite system, and bspecmHy??n.the purcha
ses of public lands. The order which ulti'
matolv directed ihe payment ofgpld and Silver
^ * in such purchases greatly checked, but could
not ai'ugether prevent, the evil. -Specie was
- . indeed more difficult to be procured than the
notes which the banks could themselves create
at pleasure, but still, being obtained from
J them as a loan, and returned as a deposite,*
which they were again at liberty to use, iL
onlv Dass^d round the circle with diminished
speed. Tiiis operation could not have been
performed, had the funds of the Government
gone into the Tieasurv, to be jegtriarly disbursed,
arid not intotanks, loaned out for their
-4 ... own profit, while they were petouuedld substitute
for it a credit in account.
In expressing these sentiments, I desire not
to undervalue the benefits of a Salutary credit
* to any branch of enterprise. The credit bes*
towed on probity, and industry is the just re
ward of merit', and an honorable incentive to
V further acquisition. dVotie oppose it who love
their country ajid 'understand ka welfare.?
$ . But when it is unduly encouraged?when it
is made to inflame the public mind with the
temptations of sudden and unsubstantial
* wealth?when it turn* industry mto paths that
- lead sooner or Jater to disaupointmeut and
. distress?it becomes liable to censure, and
jh " needs correction. Far from helping probity
and industry, the ruin to-wliich it leads falls
f, . most severely on the great laboring classes,
who are thrown suddenly out of employment,
* and, by the failure erf tnagnificeTn schemes
' nqver intended tb -enrich them, are deprived
m a moment of their only resource. Abuses
'J v . of eredit and excesses 111 speculation will hap
pen in'oespite of the most salutary laws; no
% Government perhaps can altogether prevent
. * them ; but surely every Government can rei*
frain from contributing "the stimulus that calls
\ . them into life.
Since, therefore, experience has.sho\vn, that
. to lend the public money to the focal' banks is
tf . . hazardous to the operations of the Govern^
^ . raent, at least of Joubtful benefit to. the insti.
. tations themselves, a'nd ptoducive of disas3

It is true that sugh agency is'in'many respect*

The collection, gaie-heeping^tmnsfer, ami dig*
btirsemont of the public money can, it i$, b'eky
Jieved, be well managed by officers of tflc Government.
Ite-collectign, and, to a great e.v

hitherto conducted solely by them; neither
National jior State Banks, when employed,
" being required to do more than keep it safely
while in their cUstftdy, and transfer and* pay
. it in such portions-and at.such timeS as the
r Treasury shall dir-cf.
Surely banks .arc^ not more able than the
Government to secure the money in their possession
against'accident, violence, or fraud.?
The assertion that they are so, must assume
that a vault in a bank is stronger than a vault
. in the-Treasurv; and that direct or?,-cashiers,
and clerks, not selected by the Government,
nor under its control, are more worthy of confidence
than officers selected from the people
and responsible to the" Government, officers
bound by offieial oaths and bonds for a faith
fa! performance of their duties, and* constantly
subject to the supervision of Congress.'
The difficulties of transfer, and -the aid
heretofore rendered by banks, have been less
than is usually supposed. Thcactual accounts
show that by far the larger portion of. payments
is made within short or convenient distaace
from tu^ places of collection : and the

there equal room for such supervision and pub- ! a

myjudgmcnt, to view it in a very erroneous
ht. Tho Constitiitfon prohibits the States
m making any thing but gold and silver a ten- 1
in the payment of debts, and thus secures to i
)ry citizen a right to demand payment in the.
;al currency. To provide by 1 iw that the Govmicnt
will oiily receive its dues in gold and
vcr, is not to coaferon.it any peculiar, privi
;c; butiucrcly to place it on an equality -withrj
; citizen,-by reserving to it a right, secured td
n by th'c Constitution. * It is doubtless for this

It is not proposed to procure the requirctktmount ,
by loana or increased taxation. There are now i
Ln the treasury nine millions three hundred'end |
sixty seven thousand two hundred and fourteen
dollars, dircctcd.by the act of the 23d of June, '
183d, to be duposited witl> the States in October
next. This Sum, if so deposited, will be subject, |
under Ihe.law, to be rccullcd,*if needed, to de- !
fray existing; approiations ; and as it is now evident
that the whole, or the principal part of it,,
will be wanted for that purpose, it appears most j
proper that the deposite should be withhold. 4Jn- j
til the amount can be -collected from the t>anks,
Treasury nMesmay bo temporarily issued, to.be
gradually-redecyned as it is received.
I am aware that this course maybe productive
of inconvenience; many of the States. * Rely- r
ingupon the! acts of Congress which held out to
them the strong probability; if not the- certainty,
of receiving th'is instalment, they have in some
instances adopted measures with which.its retcn
lion, may seriously interfere. That suclra*coudition
of things sljould have'occured is much to'
bo regretted. It is not the leasl amohg the unfortunate
results of the disasters oTtlie times* and
it is for Congrcss.to devise a fit remedy, if.there,
T)c one:' Tlic money bfcing indispensable to the
\yants of the Treasury, it jsdiffictrlt to conceive
upon what principle of justice or, expediency its
application to that object can be avoide'd.. To
recall.any portions of the sums already deposited
with the States, would be more inconvenient, and
.less efficient. To btifdcn the country with in.
creased taxation, when^ there is in facta lurg) .
snrplus revenue, wonld be unjust and untfisc*; t<5
raise mone y by loans under spelt circumstances,
and thus to commence a now national d bt,"
would scarcely bo sanctioned by the American
pcojde. . . * . * ?
Tho plan proposed will be adequate tb all our '
fiscal operations, during.the remainder of the
year Should it be aijopted, the Treasury, aided"by

are apt to looji io Government for too much.
Even fii our own country, where its powarsand
duties are so strictly limited, we tire prone to do
so, especially at periods qfisudd* n embarrasmbnts
and distress. But this ought not to bo. .The fraipers
of our excellent Constitution, and tho" people
who approved it with palm and sagacious deliberation,
acted at the tiino on a sounder princple.
They wisely judged that the less Goerumcnt interferes
with private pursuits, the better for the
general prosperity. It is not its legitimate object
to make men rich, or to repair, by direct grantsof
money or legi>lation in favor of particular \
pursuits-, looses not incurred in the puhlia service (*'
This would be substantially to use the property I
of Some for the benefit of others. But its . ejil (
duty:?that duty, the performance of which makes (
a good Government the most precious of human i
