sary to make known his political pritci
pies. This he will do in as brief a tman
neras possible. He is of the straitest sect
of the State Rights School of politics.
On' a strict construction of the Fcderal
Couipact,.depend, he believes, the value
and the very existence of !he Union. To
-romnote this great ubject,he will labor faith
fully, and with zeal untiring. lie is op
posed to a United States Bank, believing
it to be unconstitutional. inexpedient, dan
gerous, and peculiarly oppressio to the
South.

stitutional, Treasury scheme. He believes
it to lie the safest, the cheapest. and the
most simple plan for collecting and dis
bursing the public revenue, which has yet
been proposed.
His paper shall not be a mere political
party sheet. Agriculture and general
literature shall meet at his hands, a due
share of attention. lie will endeavor to
make judicious selections4 for the farmer,
and will cater for the delicate appetite of
the lover of polite literature. In shtort. he
will use every exertion to make his paper
as riscellaneous, and as useful as possible.
He will publish articles on all subjects of
interest,
"From grave to gay from lively to severe."
During the season of business, he will
publish every week, the prices current of

is one thing, and Geol.gy another: and
embraces a much greater extent ol knowl

mere Mineralogist. It is in a very high
degree probable, that a large portion of the
strface ofour State has been heretofore

tial volcnuic ejections, and that the soil en
closes organic remamus of fish. of aniials,
and of plants, either not now known. or

PUBLIC LANDS.
IN SENATE.
Jan. 15, 1809.
Remarks of Mr. Calhoun, of South Caro.
linat. on the engrossment of the bill for
grraduating the price of public lands.
Mr C ,Ihoult stid: I have no desire. Mr.
Presileoit, to retard.in the imallest decree.
the final aetion of the Senate on this hill:
aInd in order to avoid tnneresslry con
somption ofiine, I intend to state, as con
eisely :i posible, my views of the proper
tnliev to he pursued in reference to the
publie lands lving within the limits of the
tiew States; and my reasons for voting
ngainst the engrossment of this bill.
I ihall begin with premisinz that I am
under strong conviction, both from obser
vation and reflection, that we have arrivel
at the periol when an entire revolution of
our land system, as far as it is applicable
to those States. is unavoidable. rhey
have, in fact, outgrown the system. Sicue
its first adoption, they have come into ex
istence. have passed through a s-nte of itn
lancy, and hnve now arrived at manhood.
Tie Iyicste,, which wnas wise and just at
first, is'neither wise nor just applied to
them in their changed condition.
We nave heard much, Mr. President. in
the *resvit discttssion about the growth of
the new States, but, if I may judge from
the various measPru propose'd oni the
prisent occasion. we have heither realized
it, rapidity. nor the unavoidable changes
in our land sstem 'whicl inst frollow in
its train. I'heir wonderful growth is, in
deed one of those realities almost beyond
the grasp of imagination. When I go
back twenty-seven years, to the ieridl
when I first bee-me a tmemher of the other
I louse. and compatre what the new States
then were, to what they tow are. I amn lost
in wonder and anazement. Theirklrowth
is without example. There is nothitn,
iike it in history. At that ttme there was
hut a single new State, (Ohio.) I exclude'
Ke.ntucky, Termessee and .laine. all of
wich have been admit ted since the adop
tion of the Constitution, and limit my re
marks to those which hare since sprunia
tilt tn the public domain.
Ohio then had hnt. one Representitive
itt the other House, Jeremiah Morrow. ;in
honiest aud sensible man. who was at that
time at the head of the- gommtnittee ott Pub
lie La.ds, and nwd the conidetnce of the
House so comnpletely, that his voice was
the law on all subjects connected with
them. There were then thirty two Sena
tors in all, of which, Ohio had, of course,
two; :mat is, the one sixteenit I of ihe w hole.
In ihe electoral college she ithad three votes,
which made her weight abou the 1 50t1
in tLhat tody-a weight scarcely felt or es
tiuated in the political movements of the
day.
Such, at that time, was the infant and
feeble coudition of the new State.s. Since
then, in a pwriod but little exceeding ihm
allotted to a sitgle generaiion, to imss over
the stage of rllle,bo, wonderful the rh:m;:e'
lustead at one, as then, there are now 9
new States; and in the place of two Sena
tors in thirty-two, we now have eighteen
in lifty-two; making, instead of one-six
teenth,trore than a third f the whole; and
already three Territories, Florida, Win-r0
n ..-wa, are6 struggling for adnissioti,
When admitted, which must be shortly.
there will then he twelve new Stares, with
twenty-fonr Senators in firy-six, which
will increase their relative weight in t his
oody to three sevenths of the whole.
But as wonderful as has beetn the in
crease in this body. it will De still more so.
after the next census in the other. It will
lie taken nwe y'ear, anid a new ap~portion
tment of thie miembesrs will be made under
the Constitution; when, instead of' : single
menmer~being less thatn otne itt at hundred,
as was the case twenty seven years 'ao,
the represetttation ohf the niew States will
then staud to the old1, at least as forty to
sixty, or twoi ifths of the whole, as calcu
lated by at friend fanmiliar with the subiject,
and im whose taccuracy I have enitire coti
detice. rlTe new States having, as thmey
will then, three sevetiths ini this, and two
fifths itn the other House, *vill, of' course,
have a relative weight in the electoiral
college, or the saute thing in the choice of
President, compounded of the two, that is
five twelfths of the whole. So much for
the past.
Now .if' we turn to the future, we shall
find the cause of this amtazinit growth so
far from being exhtausted or weakened. is
actitng with intcreased force, ardl uirging for
ward the growth of' these States with ae
celerated, instead ol'a decreatsind, velocity;
so mutch so, thazt thme pass chantges in the
last mwen:y-seven years will aippear as
nothing. comipured with what will take
plaice in the next twenty seven, unless
sotme untureseen oceurr, ace should inter
vetne to retard their progress. If moy me
aory setrves me right, oiur p)opUlation, 27
years ago, was about seven mnilliom~s; and
our annual titrease thetn, that is, the ex
cess of births over d.'aths, ineltmding emi
gration,. about two hundied thousand, es
timttintg otur growth at three per cent com
pioiund. Sitnce then, our popttlation has
incereased not less than nine mtiliotns, ma
ing the piresent probablly about sixteetn;
whtich on the same data, will make our an
nual increase at this titme btit little short of
half a naillion, the great part of which
will find their homes in the ntew States.
I will not enter. into a milntte calcula
tion ias to the elfi-ets of'this great increase
oti the relati' e weight of the new amnd old
States, at the next succeeding eenstus, in
1850O. It is sufficient to say, that it will
give a decided majority to the former.
both in the House of Representatives and
in the electoral college, and, of course, in
the (overument; and thus, in the short
space of one A eneration and ai half.the con
Ire of political power, as between the old
and uew States. will have passed from the
forner to the latter.
Now, with these unuestiouable results
before us, i ask, not whether it would be
wise to contnue the old system; no, sir, a
far holder question-will it he practicable?
And it not practicable, would it be wise to
struggle to coniinue it, till overibrown by
the lhrte of unavoidable and irresistable
canses! I ask, what would be the effiects
of sui a struggle? Would it not oc to ex
cite, in the first instance, animosity and
discord between use old and new States.
iind, in the end, io overlirow the entire
land system, with the certain loss ulti
muately, oft lie public doitain! I shall not,
onl i tis occasion, attempt a formal di-cus
sion of these pnints. I prupose, in order ito
illustrate, simply to show how vain and
dangeruton %% ould be the attempt to hold on
to the present system, under these great
and growinsg cnangces, bsy tracing its opera
tions under a single aspect. its bearing on
the Prebidestial (Istion.
Tio have a clear conception of this, we
must bear in mind, that aller the next cen
aus,the Aisw States will have five-twelflhs
of the electoral college; and, of course,
s-naured to either of the other sectioiis,
it coitrollinlg voice in Ihe election of a Pres
ident. He who keeps this ii m1ind, and
understainds the workings of the hutan
heart and of our system, must see, that in
the Presidential coitest, (for such it must
eve'r be.) the great point, hereafter, will lie
to secure their favor; and that itis can -best
be done by f.avoring tnteir pecultar views
and policy in reference to the public laids.
Now one of two things must follow: either
all the cantlidaltcs will euter into ihis coin -
petitiou, in which case thestrugale will he
who s;siall o -arthcat. and its consequence
will ie togive thle vote to him who bid higii
est. It is eusy to see how this would end.
The ml'whh domain, the nsoble inheritance
ofih' peopl.-o-this Union would besquan
dered, or rather gambled away, in thecon
tesi; and would thus lie made, at the sitne
imoie.th- imeans u plundaer amid corruption.
41nd of elevating to power the most profli.
gose antd audacious.
Butif, instead ofall the catididatesseek
ing; the favor of tie new Slaie4, a part
should court-their initerests, and the others
thar otthe old States, iho train of events
wouli, msdeed. be varied, but the ultitutie
result would lie the same. Ott this suppo
sition, each of the candidates would reiort
to meanis best calculated to secure the sec
tion, on n hose support he might rely.
Thse lookina ti the new States wo;ull
push :o the extreme, the flavorite policy of
those States in reterence to the nuhlic
lands; while the others would take the op
posite extreme in flavor of the old States.
Now, when we reflect that the new
and lie old States must tecesarily. froimi
their diffiereut position and relaition to
the public lands. emertain very dilerent
views of the policy that otght to be ptir
sued in relation to them. in almost every
point-so Imucll so, that the one shal
-consider that but as the demands ofjusiier
which the other linil regard as nothinu
short. 04penl pluntler, as we have wittess
ed in tlis di-cussion-we may form some
conception of the violence of the conflict
which must eusue in the case supposed.
We have had, even in this early stage. and
on this very question, some indicaiionq of
what we may expect. The most violent
animjos-ity and hatred would follow, and
every msan, be his motive ever so pure and
itriotic, would he regasrded th e friend or
the enemy or the new or old States., aq his
opinions I'avosred thle policy of tine or the
othier. rThe final termsiat ion of t he caon

turnts of fortuno uiihlt occurini its po'fgress.
the new States must, isa the enid, prevail.
Their relative increasie is far imore rapid
thain the obal. so misuch so, thats afte'r 1850
--thsas is, after the third Presidlential eec
titn fr'omt the ntext-thiey wotld~ lie left,
as I have shown, in utdispusted possessions
jail the field. In thai mean tine, wvhiile the
IstrIde is going ons, the asnimiosily would
daily increase on boils 'sides. The longer
it contrinued, the snore bitter it would be.
acomse, iad the more certaitnly and coin
pletely would the present system be over
throwns, if indeed, the Untiost itself should
be strong enough to withstansd the shack.
Such must inevitably be the fate of the
ptresent system should we have the folly,
I suighit say the smadness, to attempt yn
contuinuie it as it is, so far as the snew States
are concernied, regardless of the great cbatn
ges which have already taken place, and
the still mnoi-e smighity its progress.
Having now pointed out the dangaer, I
turn next to the deeply imsportant quiestion
ofsremnedy,whichs demiandls the tmost prompt
and solemnit consideration, bothi of the Gov
ernent andl the commisunity. The ques
tin is, what mseans shall we adopt to
Avert the mischief' whtich -1 have showns to
.he so rnipidly approsaching, and which mnust
inevitably soons arrive, if ntot prevented by
some speedy andl efficient mneasures! Al
ready one hass heen proposed. originally
broutghtt forward to relieve a distendedl
Trresasuty of its burden, but which its au
thor (the Senator fr'aom Kentucky, Mr.
Clay) hats renewed. an the presenst oeca
sian, adoubtless -i ithi the view, in piarm, at
least, to meet the gsrowiag disorders of the
system. His proposition is to divide she
proceeds of the piublic lands aimng the
States, with the double vIew, I suplpose,
to a more equal participation in the advan
tiages osfthse public doimnis,by the membsters
of' the Uinion, annd to nreseren the present.
sysici by a more vigilant guardianship or
t he States. I doI not now itiend i db.i5cuss
the merits of this moasure. My object is
Iinlv to state, in general tertus, ily opm-t*
ion in relatiou to it, without entering itnto
the reasons on which i: is grounded.
There appears, then. to tmle, to he great
and decisive objections to the ineasure -
The right to adopt it, may in the first
place, he fairly questiowntd. We hold tihe
public domain as a common property or
fund. helotun-i'ng to the States of the Union,
in their confederated, and not in their in
dividial character. They were arquiredi
either by purchase, out of common funds
belonging to tie Union, or by cession from
ine States to the Union, to be held as a
fund in common; and I atm at a loss to
COUceive what right we have to make that
which belongs to the whole Union as a
commnt taun finund, the separate fIud of each
State. It seems to tine that it cannot be
done without a tmanilest breach of trust,
and a violation of ine Conistitution. This
is ino new opinion, formed for the occasioi.
1n was, on the contrary, formed when its
auhor first introduced tihe measure, and
when ie and myselfihought alike as to the
necessity of relieving the Treasury of its
surplus, in order to avoid the dificnlties
and inie dangers which have since followed.
Believing then. that it would be elTetual
flr thut purpose, and more easily adopted
ltan any other, I examined it with an in
clitation to embrace it as a temporary
ineasure of reiief agaitnst a pressi;; evil
hint it wais inmrpoiible for nine to bring my
iniad to assent to tine right of aioptintg it.
But snppotse ihis dillienby surnoiunted;
there are others, which I regard as inur
mountable. - Among then. the fiscal oh)
jecious are very formidable. The revenne
Cromn he lands cannot he spared at present,
and if distrihuted. as proposed by tine mea
sure, would necessarik throw tihe whole
expeinses of tinh. Government ont a sinuzle
mource-the tieuiis on imporra-and which
must Ie followed iv their increase. Tis
would neither be fair, nor equal; and to
which I, representinig in part, a portion of
thet Union, ton which ilhe increased hurden
woitd mainily rall. cannliot eive mily assent.
Bnt as formindi able as is tii, there are
others lfar miore so. It wvouid not meet. or
avert the approaching danger. It would
still leave tihe puttblie lnds in the new
States, under the oporntiont of the present
systen. ani the -uiject oif violent conflict
between thean niltd the old States, with all
the calamitous consequences to which I
heave advertod. Ioead of prevetiing the
d.anger, in would, in ict, iasten and ao
gravate it. It may be laid down nas a
ima!Xim, that no neasure can avert it. which
is not adopted with the apnprobation and
consent of the ew States; fil tleu simple
reasnin, that ilney tnust soon become the
predominant power; when that which was
established against their consent,would be
certain!v overthrown. Such would bte
the case with the measure under consider
aion. If adopted, it musttt not only I C
winhout tine eonsent oif those States, but
with their str'enuous oipposition. of which
we have had the most coiclusive evidence
on the Iresent occion. When moved
by its anihor, as an ainendmettt to this
hill, if was violently oppowed at ine thres
hold from that quarter. and ived 'out a
inge vote from the new Sna:ts. It is not
;Nc aly )to inquire whether this opposi
tion on their part is reasonable, or not;
whether it is the result ofmere prejudice,
or of deliberate conviction that it is hostile
to their interests. The fact itself, th't
there is an alnot universal and deiermin
ed resistance to the measure Ott their pr,
right or wrong, is, of itself, sufficient proof
that it cannot he relied otn ti avert tine
threatening danger. On the contrary, its
necessary efieet must be ito accelerae and
aggravate i . Its adoiptiotn wonuld, an once,
bring i he old aind new States itnto viol-nt
cnfilict, in wh~ich tine fonrmer wvould be
arrayed, aintost to a man, in determmied
effbrt to overthtrow the arr'anngemrentt. or
somte mtor'e hostile mieasure. Add to thnis
that the Presidnticail contest wvouldt ntot
fail to run into tihe conntr'oversy, and titus
redloublle tine excitemtnent anid animosity,
with all tine fatal consequennces whnich I
hanve show n must follow i'roma blending the
two.
Assuming, then, that the schenmeis both
objectionable and ineflicient, the~ question

Re0stiing my estiiate of the compellsition
on these pri eiiles,'l have supposed *that
the new Slates might pay over annually -
one half of the gross proceeds of sales to
the Government, and have an ample sum
Iefi Ior their compensation. But this is a
mere esimate, without suflicieut data. and
is, of course, liatile to be increased or di
minished after a careful calculation fuuud
ed on racts.
Vith these -uggestiqps as to the terms,
I next proceed to the conditions on which
the lands oueht to be disposed of. I pro
pose I snggret only ihe most prominent,
without piretending to a full enumeration.
It order to give stability to the arrange
inet, it he will indispensable that the
whole trans -ction should assume the form
of coipact; and for this purpose,- that
Coigress should pass an act containing
the teris and conditions of the transfer;
and that each of the new States should
pass one, on their part, to le irrevo.
cable, assenting to the same, before it is
made. Te act .of Coniress should, of
course, determinie .vhat part of the pro
cueds is to he paid annually to the Goveru
ment, and the time and manner of pay
ment; and alsoto provide ot keeping regu
lar books of acciunis, to be open to the
inspection or the Government, so that the
exact state of the account between it, and
the Stutes. ;ay, atall times; be ascertain
ed by the former.
The act ofCongressshould also contain
all the prospective provisions which may
become necessary in the future administra
tion of the lands under the arrangements;
and should then provide .i hat the land laws,
is imodilied by ie act, and as far as they
are al)llicaIle to the new state of things,.
sliall remain unlchianged, without the con
setit of Conigress. A provision of this
kind would lhe not less essential to the
States, than to the Government. Without
it, there coul. be no stahility nor uniformi
ty. Without it, the States would, in a
shorttimle, enter into a competition to turn
the current of immigration, each towards
itself, which would comtence by a reduc
tion of price. and end by a loss of the
lands. But with the provision proposed,
the system would retain its uniformity and,
become more stable than at present.
To enforce the faithiul execution of the
compact, the net should also contain a pro
vision that. in the event of the violation
of the conditions of cession, all grants
therearter made by the State should he
nill auud void. This "bId place the
compat iunder the protetion of the court
of the Union, and make it the interests of
the State, anti its citizens to observe it.6 In

posed to be made to the States, i er to
