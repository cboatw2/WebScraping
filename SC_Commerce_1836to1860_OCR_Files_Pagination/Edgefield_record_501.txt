Magnolia.-We have before us the A pril
number of this valuable periodical, and in
order to do justice to it, we feel it our duty
to recommend it to the support of the lov

ought to be nourished, and not suffered to
droop, and die, as most of our Southern
works of the kind has done. We hope
shortly to hear of the Magnolia being one

Destructive Fire at North Bend.-Scarce
ly a week has elapsed (says the National
Intelligencer,) since we assisted in paying
Funeral Honors to the memory of Gen.
Harrison, and we receive information that
the Mansion in which he resided, the abode
of his family-the house which had known
hiltt but was to "know him no more"
has been destrosed by fire! Truly now is
his family "-vithout a hone." The fid
Jowing is all the account we have of this
last calamity:
From the Cin. Republican Extra, April 12.
Fire at North Bend.-The Captain of
the steamer New York reports that when
he passed North Bend, at 6 o'clock last
night, the West Wing of the Mansion
House of Gen. Harrison was on. Fire-the
roof was covered with persons with axes
and buckets of water-the windows of the
house was taken out, and the furniture
-had all been removed out upon the green
.in front of the house. The Captain thinks
.the main building will be saved.

The Fire at North Bend.-We are glad
to learn by the Cincinnati papers received
this morning, that the injury to the Man

Mr. Pr-eston.-The following is the H-on.
Wim. C. Prestu's letter in response to the
late meeting in St.John's. Coileton. The
honorable gentleman, after giving his own
views, refers the committee wbo addres
sed him, to the language of the late Presi
dient, and Mr. Tyler, for his answer:
" Cor~rtara, A pril 14, 1841..
'-Sir, I have had the honor to receive
your nte inclosing the proceedings of a
mneeting of "the inhabitants of St. John's,
Colleton." That portion of the proceedings
which purports to be fountded on a rumor
eenceaening my sentiments and position in
the Senate of the United States, concludes
with a categorical question, whether- I in
tend to vote for a charter ofa U. S. Batnk.
"The reinstitution of a United States
Bank presents a very complex question,
both of principle and detatl, and mttst in
my judgment, depend on a carer~ul consi
deration of a vast variety of circumstances,
existing a: the moment it is proposed. Its
very constitutionality must depend upon
the actual condition of the country-and
were even that conceded, the organization
presents so nmany important difliculties.
that it would be unsafe to venture on any
conclusion, until a definite and complete
proj~ect be presented.
-"The amount of capital-the mode of
obtaining the capital-the place where the
bank is to be established-its manageatett
and control-and, above all, thte finnacial
emergencies of the country at the moment
when it is proposed-each and nll of them
exact a grave and caut'ious deliberation.
" laadvance, therefore, Ican answer ahe
interrogatory propou-ndedi, onty by anntoutn
cing the general principle on which I stanad
-and this I beg leave re do in the language
of our late lamented Presidient, and of the
acting President. as coantained in answer of
the Ianer to a similar questiaon pu to him
during the late LPesidential canvass.
*In reply to the Airst brauch of your itn
quiry." (said Mr. Tyler.) '1] quote and
adopt the lanaguagea of Gen. Harnisen, in)
his speech delivered at Dayton. ' There
is not in the Coatttation-. arty express grat
of power for such purpose. atnd it could
never be constitutiona$ to~ exercise thtat
power, save in the event the powers granted
to Congress could not be carried into eljjet
svithout resorting to such an institut ion.
The Constitution confers on Conagress in
express terms, 'alt powers which are ne
cessary and proper to carry into effect the
granted powers." Now if --the powers
granted" couldnot be carried into effect
without incorpolratinig a bank, then it be
comes "necessary and proper," nnd of
course expedient-a conclusion which I
presttmc no onc wottld deny wh desiredl
to see the existence of the government pre
served, and kept benefieially in operation.
1I have only to add that the creative ne
cessity should he palpable and overruling."
I have the honor to be,
Most respect fully, your obd't. serv't.

-" Cut down and withered in an hour !"
The Boston Atlas of Saturday morning
contained the following notice of the in
tended voyage of its editor, Major Haugh
ton to Europe:
"Mr. H aughton, the proprietor and sen
ior editor of this journal, will sail in the
Acadia this afternoon, for Liverpool. Dur
ing his absence, he will leave the editorial
department of the Atlas under the sole
charge of Dr. Thomas M. Brewer, junior
editor. The business transactions of the
office will also be conducted by Dr. Brew
er, as his authorised agent and attorney."
The Boston Mercantile Journal of Sat
urday afternoon contained the following
melancholy announcement:
-Death of Richard Haughton !-We
have this day a melancholy duty to per
form, that of recording the death- of our
contemporary, Richard Haughton, of this
city, the editor and proprietor of the Bos
ton Atlas. At about 12 o'clock, while Mr.
Haughton was making arrangements for
his departure, and apparently in the pos
session of as mneh health as he had en
joyed for snme months past, he was sud
denly attacked with illness, probably apo
plexy, and immediately expired.
- Mr. Haughton was well known as an
able editor. In industry and enterprise,
he has seldom heen equalled-his political
kno vledge was very extensive, anil under
his direction, the Atlas has exercised a
great influence in matters connected with
our state and national governments, for
several years.
- Mr. Haughton had tany warmly at
tached personal as well as political friends,
tor he possessed many qualities honorable
to human nature-and his sudden and pre
nature death, he being only about forty
five years old, will carry sorrow to many
a narly bosom."
Major Haughton was originally des
tined for orders in the Episcopal Church,
and his studies were directed to that end.
But he very early showed an inclination for
a political life, and during the latter years
of Mr. Monroe's administration he edited a
paper in Washington called the National
Republican. It was in the interest of Mr.
Calhoun, when with him Messrs.Craw ford,
Adams and Clay. were aspirants for the
Presidentship. The National Republican
died during the administration of Mr. Ad
ams, and in 1828 Major H. came to New
York, and was for a period employed as
an assistant in the office of the Journal of
Commerce. Heitee he removed to Bos
ton, where he established the Atlas, about
nine years ago. Ile w-as a gentleman of
very respectable talents and great enter
prize-but an imprudent politician.
It may be noted as a striking coirci
dence, that the Atlas, on the very mon
ing of the most unexpected death of its
editor, but a few hours befbre its occur
rence, contained a dirge beginning
Weep! for the word is spoken
Mourn! for the knell is kuolled
The master chord is broken -
And the master hand-is cold.
True, the " word" hail already been
"spoken." and before the sun was down
Sthe matr hand" was "cold."-. 1'.
Corn. Ado.
Collector at Boston.-Thie Precsident has
app1ointed Levi Lincoln, late Governor of
Massachusetts, and a member of the next
Congress, Colletor of the Port of Boston.
This is the first instance under the present
Administr-ation, of the appointment of a
Member of Congress to an office of mere
emolument. We trust it may he the last.
I' is perfectly right and proper for the Pre
sident to go into Congress for his Cabinet.
Thet-e he may be expected to find men of
more experience in public-affairs, and het
ter fitted for his constitutional advisers than
any where else. But fr an oficeeof profit
alone, a represent ntive of tthe people shotuld
never be selcted; and thte member w-ho
accepts sneh a post, abatndons the trust re
p~osedl in him by his constituents, and man
ifests a dereliction of ditty thtat ought to
prodlude his appointment to any office.
'The people have honored him with their
confidence, and chosen him to gumat-d their
itrests. H-e cannot discharae himself of
the oligation, for a mere mat ter of dollars
and cents, without dishonor.-N. Y. -Her.
The following boast of a Whig paper
shows that in Virginia the Whigs consider
Mr. Tyler as opposed to a National Batik.
-Charleston Courier.
We really commiserate the situation of
the loco foco stump demagogues and pot
house polit icians in the South. The death
of Getn. Hlarrison has retndered them hank
rutpt, by depriving thenm of all political
capital. John Tyler is now president of
the United States, and it would require
more than evetn loco foci) elfi-ontery, to tell
a Virginia audience that they had aught to
feair from him, on the subiject of A bolition,
the Tariff, the Bank. the assumption of
Stare debts, &c. What thten can these de
claimters go upon ? Will they~ declare war
in :advance upon his adlministration ? W~e
helieve the opprosition pntry of Virxinia is
too jutr mnul aeneronus to adtopt 'his unman

ABBEVILLE
l1ineral Springs.
T HIS ESTABLISHMENT is now in
complete order for the reception of visit
ors, and is extensively provided with every ac
commodation and comfort which persons in
search of health oz recreation, cindesire. Mr.
and Mrs. Lawhow, who are charged with its
superintendance. are eminently qumlified to
give satisftetton, and the Directors ean prom
ise that as good a table and as clean and eom
modions rooms will be furnished, as are to be
had at any watering place in the United States.
These Springs are situated in a healthy and ro-.
mantic region in the North Western corner of
Abbeville District, near the Anderson line, and
the-plare is as perfectly exempted from autuin
nal fevers as any place in our Mountains. The
waters are confidently believed to be equal to
any in the United States, in all cases of chronic
disease of the liver and other glands, and of
chronic inflammation in any part of the system
-in cases of dispepsia and sick head ache they
have been singularly efficacious, having invari
ably given relief whenever adequately tried.
In these cases they may be almost considered
a specific, as well as in diseases ofthe skin and
urinary organs. A Hack will be regularly run
during the season from Abbeville C. H., which
is 24 miles distant, to carry passengers coming
to that place in the Stage.
BY THE DIRECTORS.
I herpby certify rrom personal observation,
that the water of the Abbeville Mlineral Springs
is singularly serviceable in all case, or chronic
inflammation and glandular obstructions. It
does not appear to possess any highly stimula
ting or direct tonic properties. but imparts tone
to the whole system indirectly by its wonderful
eff'ect in wearimg out inflammation, and in cor
recting the secretions of all the glands of the bo
dy A few Summers ago, I sent a patient to
the Springs labouring tinder chronic gastretis,
which I found very difficnit to treat to ndvan
