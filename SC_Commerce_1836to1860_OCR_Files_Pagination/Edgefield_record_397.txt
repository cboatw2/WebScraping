Why every Democrat should -ole for
Van Buren.-ecauese. from a poor f'riemi
less, and unaided boy. who labored during
his youth as a hirelitng on a farm. he rose
to the highest office in the world, by his
owen mrits. and by his own ereriions
thus proving that no matter how poor
a nirn he, in this country, he many rise in
the highest distinction, if he pleases, by
liq good vonduct and intelligence.
Because from his earliest youth he has
gone for his country with zeal and energy.
All the principles ofthe Democratic part%
have ever found in him a supporter and :U
champion; while all the federal guil-traps
and falsehoods have been by him as
;taunchly aind effectively opposed.
Because. although the unceasing object
of federal virulence aid rage, they have
neither been able to detect one blot in his
public character, "to mingle admiration or
to craitify haired."
Because, he has always raised his voice
against the onward strides of the money
power.
Because, he has never hesitated about
avowing himself against the madness of
the Aolitionist, and as utterly oppsoed
to all theirschetnes.
Beenncese. ie has never shrunk from an
avow tal of his political creed. His' letter
to Sh- rod Williams and his whole history
prove that he is not a lunatic nder the
coirol of keepers, or falleu into second
childhood.
Recause, during the late threatoning
d ficultes between this conry, and
England, lie managed the afinir so patri
otie-like and so fareless ofrconsequences.
that his own enemies. placed. by their
votes in Congress. ten miliions of dollars
at his disposal, as the sitew of expected
U ar, and anthcrised hiat to raise an armty
of filtv ahoasanad men !
Because, in all his puhlie transactions,
no vote of censure wacs ever preferred
against him, on aeroneta of neglect, mnal
feasance, or deficeiencey.
Because. havmat risen from naked pav

ENERGY oF CHARACTER.-EneTgy of
character is the philosopher's stoge, 9f his
life. and shouldI be.. engraved upon every
heart-it is that which has peopled the
temple of fame-that which has filled the
historic pages with great names, and the
.civil and military world-that which has
brought a race from barbarism, drawn. the
veil from science, and d.eveloped the won
Idronus powers of nature-it makes men
great. and makes men rich. First or last
it brings success. Without it Webst*r

-Prir.ce, a tame lion, on board his Ma
jesty's ship Ariadue, had a keeper to whou
he was 'inch attached ; the ieeper got
drunk on'e day. and, as the captain never
foren ve the crime, the keeper was ordered
to be forged ; the grating was rigged on
the main deck, opposite Prince's den, a
large bar'red up pllace, the pillars large
rnd ensed.7with imu- When the. kneper
began to strip. Prince rose,gloomily from
his couch, and got as nenr to his friend as
possible ; on beholding his hare back, he
walked hastily round the den, and when
lie saw ifie hioatswain inflict the first lash;
his eyes sparled with fire. and his sides re
sounded nith the strong and qitick bea7
tings of his tail ; at last, when the 'blood
begani to flow froin the unfortunate man's*
ha'ck. ant i he "cloted cats" jerked their
gory knots close.to the lion's den, his fury
becatme tremendous, he roared with a.
voice of thunder. shook the strong bars of
his prison, as if they had hen osiers, and
finding his efforts to break loose unavail
ing, he rolled and shrieked in a manner thbo
most terrific that it is possible to conceive.
The captain, fearing thai he might break.
loose, ordered the marines to ldad and pre
sent at Prince; this threat redoubled his
rage. and at last the captain desired the
keeper to be cast ol 'and go to his friend'
Ii is im possible to describe th'joy evinced
by the lion; he licked with care the man

which he folded round the keeper as if to
