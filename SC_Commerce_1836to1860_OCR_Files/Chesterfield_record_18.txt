TEXAS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
The unanimous Declaration of Independence
made by the Delegates of the People
of Texas, in General Convention,
made at the town of Washington, on the
2d day of March, 1836.
When a government has ceased to protect
the lives, liberty, and property of the
people from whom its legitimate powers are
derived, and for the advancement of whose
happiness it was instituted, and so far from
being a guarantee for the enjoyment of
those inestimable and unalienable*ights, becomes
an instrument in the hands of evil ru
iers tor their oppression; when the tederal
republican constitution of their country,
which they have sworn to support, no longer
Ui.is a substantial existence, and the whole
nature of their government has been forcibly
changed, without their consent, from a resvtrictcd
federative republic, composed of se.
veral states, to a consolidated central military
despotism, in which every interest is
disregarded; but that of the army and the
priesthood?both the eternal enemies 'of-ci<utl
liberty, the ever ready minions of power,
and the usual instruments of tyrants; When,
feng after the spirit of the constitution has
departed, moderation at length so far lost by
fihosc in power that even the semblance of
(freedom is removed, and the framcrs them,
-selves of the constitution discountenanced,
:o&d-SD far from their petitions and rcmon stranuos
being regarded, the agents who
bear them are thrown into dungeons?and
mercenary armies scntiorth to force a new
government upon them at the point of the
bayonet When, in consequence of such
nets of malfeosance, and abdication, on the
part of the government, monarchy prevails,
and cm) society dissolves into its original
elements: In such a crisis, the first law of
nature, the right of self preservation, the inherent
and inalienable Tight of the people to
~ appeal to first principles, and take their po tlrtieal
affairs into their own hands, in cxtrcmenses,
enjoins it as a right towards themselves,
and a sacred obligation to their po9terity,
to abolish such government, and
create another in its stead,calculated to rescue
tfiem from impending dangers and to secure
their future welfare and happinessNations
as well as individuals arc amenable
for their acts to the public opinion of
nwfiwtfl A (^statement of a part ofour grieYWteWTB
therefore submitted to-an impartwl
maid, in justification of the hazardous
but unavoidable step now taken, of severing
war connection with the Mexican peo
pic, and assuming an independent attitude
among the nations of the earth.
The Mexican government, by its colonization
laws, invited and iniuced the AngloAmerican
population'of Texas to colonise
:thc wilderness, under the pledged faith of a
written constitution, that they should conti.
nue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and
.republican government to which they had
been habituated in the land of their birth, the
United States of America. In this expectation
they have been cruelly disappointed
?as the Mexican nation has acquiesced in
the late changes made in the government by
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna;
who, having overturned the constitution of
this country, now offers us the cruel alternative,
either to abandon our own house, ac
. i . .
quirea oy so many pnvations, or suomit to
the most intolerable of all tyranny, the combined
despotism of the swoird and the priesthood.
It has sacrificed our welfare to the state
of Coahuila, by which our interests have
been continually depressed, through a jealous
and partial course of legislation, ca tried
on at a fer distant seat of government, by a
hostile majority in an unknown tongue; and
ithis, too, notwithstanding we have petition.
'Od in the humblest terms for the establish,
meat of a separate state government, and
have, in accordance with the provisions ol
tthe national constitution, presented to the
general congress a republican constitution,
<which was, without just cause, contemptu

It ltos d5ssol?ed by f^tce of arrr.3 the

l obliged our representatives to fly for their *
; lives from the seat of government; thus ;
depriving us of the fundamental political
. right of representation.
> It has demanded tlie surrender of a a
1 number of our citizens, ajid ordered military 1
I detachments to secure and carry them into J
i the interior for trial; in contempt for the c
5 civil authority, and in defiance of the laws l
i and the constitution. *
; It has made piratical attacks upon our J
, commerce, by commissioning foreign des- c
. peradoes and authorising them to seize our c
i vessels, and convey the property of our a
i citizens to far distant ports for confiscation. ^
It denies us the right of worshipping the ?
I Almighty according to the dictates of our
) conscience?by the support of a national
, religion, calculated to promote the temporal t
. interests of its human functionaries, rather v
? than the glory of the true and Jiving God. *
It has demanded us to deliver up our jj>
t arms, which are essential to our defence, the c
rightful prosprrty offrecraen, and formidable .
i only to tyrannical governments. h
! It has invaded our country, both by sea J
and land, with intent to lay waste our ter- a
ritory, aad c'rive us from our homes?and C
has now a large mercenary armv advancing *1
to carry on against us, a war ot extermina. a
tion. ?
It has, through its emissaries, incited the
merciless savage, with the tomahawk and I
scalping knife, to massacre the inhabitants a
in our defenceless frontier.
It hath been, during the whole time of our
connexion with it, the contemptible sport
and victim of Recessive military revolutions;
and hath continually exhibited every characteristic
of *&" weak, corrupt and tyranical
governments
These and other grievances were patiently
borno by the people of Texas, until they
reached that point at which forbearance
ceases to be a virtue. We then took up
arms in defence of the National Constitution.
Wc appealed to our Mexican brethren
for assistance. Our appeal has been made
in vain; though months have elapsed, no
sympathetic response has yet been heard
from the interior. We are therefore forced
to the melancholy conclusion, that the
Mexican people have acquiesced in the tl
destruction oftheir liberty, and the substitution
therefor of a military government; ?
that tbey arc unfit to be free and incapable t.
of self-government. p
The necessity of self-preservation therefore
now decrees our eternal political separa- 0
tion. We therefore, the delegat s with 41
plenary powers of the people of Texas, tl
m soienm convention assemuieu, appearing a
to a candid world for tho necessity -of our w
condition, do hereby resolve, and declare ^
that our political connexion with the Mexican
j nation, has forever ended, and that the
i people of Texas do now constitute a free, C
sovereign, and independent republic, and a
are fully invested with all the rights and n
attributes which properly belong to in- ?
dependent nations. 1

l they go directly to Texas; when they are dischar?
ged by Gen. ScotU?It was generally believed
: when our Informant left, that the Indians had retreated
to the everglades, and many were known
to be in the rear of General Scott's army. It was
' pretty well ascertained thai Oseola alone, of all j

will result to us, from prosecuting our discoveries,
in a commercial and political view. There has
been, of late, groat difficulty in obtaining the
Hall, since the power of granting its use was
taken out of the hands of the Speaker, and it is

that there was bo opposition made to hi9 application,
which had been made through the Committee
on Commerce.
"The individuals who aland charged with
firing the Treasury Building in the year 1833,
have oil been arrested, as it is supposed, before
this. Tho principal actors in the transaction
are men named Hix and White. White was
arrested in New York on Friday week, and was
brought to this city last Saturday. It appears
from tho story ot Hix, who is now used as
States-cvidcnco, that tho building was destroyed
at the instance of Judge Temfle, of Vermont,
who had committod extensive forgeries on the
Treasury, by forging pension certificates. Apprehending
detection, ho employed White and
athcrs to do tho deed; but tho papers sooght to
be destroyed were saved, and to avoid disgrace;
Judge, Temple committed suicide.
" It is not a little singular, that a dood of so
much atrocity, as that ol destroying tho Treasury
building should have been confided to the
management ot a number of nanus, ana 11 appears |
from the dovelopements already made, that up.
vards of a dozen had a hand in it.
