Mr. Hammond rose to move that the potion

Mr. Adams. I claim the floor, and shall
not yield it. I move, sir, that the |>etition he
referred to a select committee of this House,
with instructions to report thereon.
Mr. Glascock rose and asked if the gentleman
was in order.
Mr. Adams called the gentleman to order,

he, atthis time, on account of the suspension
of a decision on my appeal from a decision
of the Chair, which appeal I had the honor
of making some weeks ago. By that do.
cision it was determined that a motion of
reception is dobateable.
The'Chair stated that the gentleman was
not in order io debate a point of order made
on a former occasion.
Mr. Adams said, it is not the question of
order which it is my purpose to discuss.
The chair has decided that a motion to re.
crive a petition is dehatcabJe, and that the
45th rule does not apply to it. Under that
decision I claim the floor, and shall proceed
to support my motion that tiie petition be j
received.
The Chair said the gentleman was in or-1
der to discuss that question.
After various motions and some debate, i
Mr. Adams said that it was for the pur- j
nnen rr>fi>rr!im thf> nPtition to a Select COIT1
V. . n ,
mittee that he moved its reception. It came
from 106 females, with a request that he
Would present and support it. His wish
was that the petition should be received, and
referred to a committee, who should make
a report to the House, which should show
satisfactorily to the petitioners why the
prayer of their petition ought not to be grant,
ed. He looked upon thcpreserilation of any
petitions with which lie might be entrusted
to be an imperative duty, which nothing
should induce him to decline.
Mr. Miller moved that the motion of re.
ccption he laid on the table?agreed to.
Mr. Adams presented a petition signed by
sundry citizens of Western Pennsylvania,
praying the abolition of slavery and the
slave trade in the District of Columbia.

Mr. Adams said he had Still another petition
on the same subject, signed by 400
citizens of Indiana county, Pennsylvania.
He supposed that petitions might be presented
by members of that House, although they
did not come from their immediate constituents.
He did not know any of the individuals
whose names appeared on this petition,
but he would present any petition the language
of which he should deem respectful.
After a speech of some length, Mr. A. moved
that the petition be received.
On motion of Mr. Miller, the motion &f
reception was laid on the table.
Mr. Gushing presented three petitions
from sunchy inhabitants of Massachusetts,
praying the abolition of slavery and of the

content, if the House would assign a
certain da v for the consideration of the ques.

the Mouse took this course, lie should immediately
present another petition, and then
join Conclusions with the gentleman from
Georgia on the question whether the nonreception
of a petition was an encroachment
on the right of petition.
Oq motion of Mr. Hammond, the motion
of reception was laid on the table.
Mr. Cushing then presented a petition
from sundry inhabitants of Massachusetts,
praying the abolition of slavery and the
Blave trade in the District of Columbia.
Mr. Hammond objected to the reception

such a resolution, as was foreseen, led to '

We publish to-day the translation of a de- r
ce passed, in Mexico, on the 23d of Octdr
last, which will give our readers an idea r
the present torrn of the government of f
cxico. The said decree annihilates at one j

3 Governors and other state authorities j
0 the mere agents of the Central Govern- r
3nt, dependent on the will or whim of the j
itator. p
To understand more fully the extent of ?
1 outrage which has been oommitted upon r
3 constitution, it is necessary to bear in f
nd, that this generai congress was elected
der the constitution of 1824, with constiional
powers ulone; that the members (
dU the oath prescribed by tlint constitution g
observe and sustain it, and that in viola- <j
n of this oath the two houses decreed c
3mselves into a convention, and united in ?

From the Albion, a British paper pub Heard,
ih New York.?"We always thought that
France sought to avoid war, and, therefore,
would insist on terms which it is impossible
to grant. Louis Phillip well knows tliat
such a humiliating apology?for it is absurd
to call it explanation?would be utterly
scouted on this side of the Atlantic. Why
then does he demand what he knows before,
hand will be refused ? Because, we appre.
Iiend, he has taken a survey of his position,
and finds that a war will not be so unpopular

From The Courrier des Etats Unis, a
French paper also published in New York.
?? " After these positive declarations on cidier
side, how arc the two Governments to
extricate themselves from this critical and
jncasy position! We can see but three
methods.
First; by a change of ministry and of
system in France, which, releasing the new
ncumbents from the obligations resting up)n
their predecessors in office, shall permit
he former to declare themselves satisfied
vith the explanations given in the message
of December.] This event is very doubt,
ul but not impossible, for a strong opposiion
appears to have manifested itself lately
n the cabinet against the Duke do Broglie
ind the Ministers who enrol themselves unfer
his banner. The King himself appears
0 have inclined toward this change in favor
>f men who will be more accommodating
lian M. de Broglie in regard to all foreign
iffiiirs.
The second method; by the continuance
)f the uncertain and uneasy position in
,vhich we now find ourselves, during foureen
months longer, hi case the Congress of
he United States shall refuse, during all that
imcf to adopt any measures of non-inter:ourse,
of reprisals or hosiilities. The
vords which have bced found offensive by
franco having been uttered by a magistrate
ibout to retire into private Kfc, and not ap.
iroved or sustained by any act of the na.
ional legislature, we are confident that tho
?rench cabinet, of whomsoever it may be;
imposed, will at once fulfill the conditions
>f the treaty, abandoning entirely all claim
or explanations, which shall have become
iselcss by the accession of a new Presi

Tiiird method; by a war, a ruinous, ab;urd,
disastrous war, if Congress shall conlent
to the non-intercourse proposed in the
ipecial message*

cen received that tho British Government has
>ffercd its mediation.

Civilization of the Indians.?The Federal

paper to press in proper time without doub- [
; ling some of the advcrtiseriienta.

The press of congressional,.and other!
l?olitical matter, prevente our furnishing ouf
readers, at this time, with 9s much variety*
especially in the departments. which most
interest families and farmers as wc design j
generally to do. ' I
Wc arc indebted to Col. 3/anning for a I
copy ot the speech of Mr. Pickens, of this,
State, on the abolition question, and tboj
speech of Mr. Adams on his resolution to j inquire
inlo the cause of the loss of the forW^ <<
tification bill of last scscion. . &?
The latter of these speeches we biro . j
read. We had previously scan it stated I
somewhere that Mr. A. was supposed to be
laboring under some degree of mental derangement;
and white reading the speech*,
we were almost half inclined to suspect that'
there was some shadow of foundation in , *:
truth for the report. Mr. A. used to be a 9
good reasoncr, but in different parts of this jj
speech there is no connection between the
premises and conclusions. Besides, madmen
often hate their best friends most, and

speech for Me. Webster his former friend -*?
and supporter, savors very much of mora? y
if not of mental insanity. Mr. Adams's
recent movements remind us forcibly of
! some incidents in his past history, wliich are*
not very creditable to himself nor to the
country over which he was afterwards mode
President. He seems to us now a little like
a spoiled child, who is more fretted by taking
away its toy than it was gratified in receiving
it.
We have also read the speech of Mr.
Webster, which was the occasion, though
1 nnf the mnce nf Mr. Adams's fierce onset.
and though able, some part of it evincqufe.
littleness which wc did not expect from so
! great a man. There was really no call for
his tfonsunng as lie did the House of Representatives
of the last session, nor any
propriety in his doing it. If party papers*
and even members of high standing in the
House, censured the Senate and him particularly,
he ought to have felt himself above
' recrimination such as he indulged liimself
| in* J
J It will be most gratifying intelligence to
; to those of our readers who have not already
heard it, that the British Government has *v jj
despatched a special messenger to the diplo- .v %
matic agent of that country at Washington, $
directing liim to offer the mediation of his
Government between tliis country and
France, and that the offer has been accept*: eel.
The special messenger has returned
j with informarion to that effect. This dis.
! pels all apprehension of war, for the pre.
sent. Wc think tliere can be no doubt that
he difficulty will now be settled without
wax. 4 , ?

We have received from the publisher,
Mr, A. E. 71/iller, of Charleston, his edition
of the very able reply to Dr. Cbanning's
publication on slavery. It is anonymous,
but is said to have been written by the Attorney
General of Massachusetts. Wo
hope the public will reward Mr. Miller for
the expense of republication.

most of the denominations of this State.?
The article is a sketch of a u most atro.?

I Now, it is not said expressly that this atro. J
cious liar is a member of any Christian
church?this is left to be inferred; and oth- <
